title: "Chunky Raïta Salad"
slug: "chunky-raita-salad"
description: "Fresh, chunky veggie salad tossed with a tangy, herby raïta sauce. Tomato, cucumber, red pepper, and broccoli cauliflower replace traditional cauliflower—adds crunch and color. Dijon mustard swapped with whole-grain for texture; fresh mint added for a bright twist. Takes about 12 minutes total from chopping to chill. Perfect chilled but not soggy. Vegetarian, gluten-free, nut-free, egg-free, lactose-free except yogurt. Great for quick sides or light lunches. Easy to adapt, forgiving on portions and herb types. The yogurt sauce thick enough to coat but thin enough to stay creamy and lively. Salt balance critical here; too little, flat; too much, overwhelms the fresh veg."
metaDescription: "Chunky raïta salad with tomato, cucumber, broccoli florets tossed in a thick yogurt and whole-grain mustard sauce. Fresh herbs, crisp texture, quick prep time."
ogDescription: "Fresh chunky veggies meet tangy yogurt and whole-grain mustard. Chill 7 mins; salt well for bright flavor. Crunch and creamy mix with fresh mint lift."

ingredients:
- "1 tomato diced medium chunks"
- "1 small cucumber diced roughly"
- "1/2 red bell pepper thinly sliced"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) small broccoli florets, raw"
- "1 green onion finely sliced"
- "60 ml (heaping 1/4 cup) chopped fresh mint leaves"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) plain yogurt 2%, thicker style preferred"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) whole-grain mustard"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Chop all vegetables to similar sizes—bite-sized but chunky enough to hold texture. No mush."
- "Mix yogurt and mustard in a small bowl until streak-free and rustic. Whole grain mustard adds punch and grittiness—skip if you dislike texture, use Dijon instead."
- "Toss veggies with herby yogurt gently. Avoid overmixing or veg releases water. Use a large bowl."
- "Season with salt and pepper sparingly at first. Taste after chilling and adjust as cold dulls flavors."
- "Refrigerate at least 7 minutes to meld but not soggy. Watch for watery pooling—drain or pat dry if needed before mixing next time."
- "Serve chilled or slightly cool. Ideal texture is crisp, coated but not swimming in sauce."
- "Leftovers keep good up to 24 hours but crispness fades—add fresh herbs or lemon juice before serving again to refresh."
introduction: "Been messing with raïta for a while. Usually too watery or bland. Swapped cauliflower for broccoli because cauliflower tends to sog here and broccoli holds up well. Mint over cilantro gives a fresh snap, especially in summer heat. Whole-grain mustard adds texture bites you don’t expect in a smooth sauce, though might split folks. Yogurt thickness matters—too runny ruins crisp veg. Learned to chop veggies chunkier than usual; fuzzier edges suck sauce and get slimey quick. Chill is crucial—at least 7 minutes but not longer than 15 or veg weeps. Salt and pepper timing tricky—best added twice: once before chill, once after tasting cold. Too little salt? Flat as a pancake; too much? Harsh and sharp. No fuss, no fancy stuff—just fresh, crisp, cool. If I was stuck on a desert island, this’d keep me sane and hydrated."
ingredientsNote: "Vegetables fresh and firm make all difference here. Tomato needs to be ripe but firm, too soft and mess in minutes. Cucumber: English variety preferred, less seedy, reduces water by default. When swapping broccoli for cauliflower, smaller florets work better—they crunch and don't soften like cauliflower often does. Mint adds that cooling lift—if unavailable, swap for cilantro or basil but flavor shifts. Yogurt: aim for Greek or strained plain yogurt for creaminess; watery yogurt kills texture. Whole-grain mustard is less common but adds fun bursts of flavor and texture contrast; Dijon works if you want smooth but lose bite complexity. Green onions mild onion flavor; scallions or chives okay. Salt well but incrementally—better to add than fix oversalting. Pepper freshly ground for bite."
instructionsNote: "Chunk sizes critical. Chopping by hand keeps rustic texture—don't pulverize. Skip food processors; they make paste. Mixing: fold gently, slow but steady. Avoid smashing veggies. Watch for liquid pooling; if too wet, pat dry cucumbers and peppers before mixing next attempt. Salt at start to help draw out some water, then a pinch after chilling to brighten flavor. Cold dulls mustard and mint aroma; adjust seasoning after fridge. Let sit uncovered in fridge for 7 to 10 mins—not longer or veggies sweat. Best served cool but not ice cold to keep flavors alive. Leftovers? Stir fresh mint and a splash of lemon juice in before serving again. Avoid pre-mixing too far ahead; sauce can separate and veggies become soggy quickly, losing the whole point of crisp and fresh. A quick chop and toss—not a stew."
tips:
- "Chop veggies bigger; small chunks soak sauce too fast, get slimey. Bite size means hold their crunch while coated. Rough cuts for cucumber keep water in check. Watch broccoli florets; smaller bits soften quick, bigger keep snap but not woody."
- "Mustard choice matters. Whole-grain punches with gritty texture, adds contrast. Dijon is smooth, lose grit but keep flavor intact. Skip mustard? Blend in lemon zest or mild horseradish powder for subtle bite without losing creaminess from yogurt."
- "Salt twice; first with chopped veg to draw water out then again after chilling. Why? Cold dulls flavors, so a pinch post-chill brightens sharpness missing early on. Always start light, taste often, salt is tricky here. Overdo and veg get lifeless."
- "Mix gently. Folding not stirring like batter. Crush less—veg break releases water fast, sauce thins, turns soup-y. Use large bowl, toss slowly so yogurt clings but veggies stay chunky, textures intact. Pat dry overly wet veggies before mixing if needed."
- "Chill just right; 7 to 10 mins. Longer means water pools and crunch goes missing. Watch for wetness—sometimes cucumber weeps after salt, drain excess liquid. Serve cool, not ice cold. Coldness kills aroma of herbs and mustard, dull flavor fast without seasoning adjustment."
faq:
- "q: Can I use cauliflower instead of broccoli? a: Cauliflower sogs faster, risks mush. Smaller florets try. Broccoli holds crunch. If you use cauliflower, salt extra and drain water well. Texture noticeably softer, flavor less sharp."
- "q: What if no whole-grain mustard? a: Dijon works smooth with less bite. Or swap mustard with a pinch horseradish powder or mild wasabi paste. You lose grittiness but keep sharpness in sauce. Skip if allergic or dislike texture, just yogurt and herbs still tasty."
- "q: Why does raïta get watery? a: Veg releasing water after chopping is main culprit. Salt pulls moisture out. Mix gently. Chill too long, water pools on bottom. Pat dry cucumbers if needed. Use thick Greek strained yogurt. Thin yogurt equals runny sauce."
- "q: How long to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container fridge max 24 hours. Veg crunch fades fast, soggy sets in. Stir in fresh mint and lemon juice before serving again to wake up flavors. Avoid pre-mixing too far ahead; sauce separates, veg softens."
