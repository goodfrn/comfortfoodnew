ingredients:
- "1 large red bell pepper peeled seeded diced"

- "120 g smoked bacon diced"
- "1 small shallot thinly sliced"
- "15 g fresh flat leaf parsley chopped"
- "15 g fresh chives chopped"
- "salt to taste"
- "freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat."
- "Add diced red peppers and sliced shallots. Stir constantly for about 7 minutes or until peppers start to caramelize and become tender."
- "Add diced smoked bacon and continue cooking 5 to 6 minutes until bacon is browned and crispy, peppers deeply confited."

- "Transfer mixture to a bowl. Serve warm or at room temperature."
- "Optionally, pass through a fine sieve for a smoother texture or leave chunky for rustic feel."
introduction: "Bell peppers in olive oil. The oil sizzles, peppers soften, edges brown, sweet juices emerge. Not just fried—confits. Bacon brings salt, smoke, crisp. Small shallots add a hint of sweetness beneath. Herbs fresh, rough chop, parsley and chives scattered at the end. Heat modulates, oil moves, shapes flavor—a dance. Warm or so-so temp. Simple ingredients, turned up a notch. Crostini topper or hearty snack. Peeling peppers for silkiness; chopped sizes altered for bitesize chunks. No cream, no nuts, no dairy fuss. The result: sticky, salty, herby chaos on a plate, begging to be spread or eaten straight off the spoon. Rustic, fast, sideways and chopped up. Try fishing out shallot slivers before serving, or leave the whole mess intact."
ingredientsNote: "Peeling peppers is optional but smooths texture. Removing seeds cuts bitterness. Using smoked bacon instead of pancetta adds depth and changes saltiness. Shallots are a twist—thin slices cooking into sweetness balancing bacon salt. Olive oil quantity reduced slightly, enough to lightly sizzle and caramelize without drowning. Herbs increased for a fresher punch, chopped roughly for rustic look. Adjust salt after cooking because bacon and oil carry saltiness already. Could swap chives for tarragon or basil for a different herbal note. Keep all ingredients fresh—herbs and shallots delicate but essential. Pepper variety matters: red or yellow sweeter, green more vegetal, but adjust cooking times for firmness."
instructionsNote: "Use medium-high heat to start but don’t burn oil or bacon. Stir often when caramelizing peppers and shallots to avoid burning yet allow sugars to develop. Add bacon later to control crispness time; bacon too early can release fat and prevent pepper confit. Cooking times shortened a bit—peppers soften and brown quicker with peeled skin. Add herbs off heat to preserve flavor and bright color. Season last because bacon and oil are salty. Passing mixture through a fine sieve creates a smooth spread; otherwise serve chunky for rustic feel. Let cool slightly before serving to meld flavors. Can be reheated gently. Storing leftovers in airtight container; consumes within three days due to fresh herbs and bacon. Great dolloped over toasted bread or alongside roasted meats."
tips:
- "Use fresh ingredients. Herbs matter. Fresh parsley and chives really pop. Peel peppers if you want smooth texture. Bite-size pieces help with snacking. Adjust salt last, bacon adds salt too. Cook medium-high. Don't burn it. Keep stirring. It helps caramelization. Flicking in shallots brings sweetness. But don’t let them burn. Timing is key. Bacon can release fat."
- "Want it chunkier? Skip the sieve. Enjoy rustic texture. Serves well on crostini. Store leftovers tight in a container. Use in three days. Great with roasted meats. Snack on it cold. Or warm, up to you. Smaller batches work too. Cut down ingredient size. Sauté faster. Flexible cooking times depending on stove."
- "If you prefer, use other herbs like tarragon or basil. They change things up. Pair differently with your meal. Yellow or red peppers add sweetness. Green peppers feel more vegetal. Cooking times vary with pepper type. Adjust for firmness. If you're in a hurry, short the cooking times some more."
- "Take care with oil. Be mindful not to overdo it. Enough to sizzle, not drown. Balancing oil and bacon is crucial for texture. Let mix cool slightly before digging in. It melds flavors better. Shrug off if shallots stay chunky or fish them out. Easy to adjust based on preference."
- "If pressed for time, you can prep bacon beforehand. Cook it until crispy, then set aside. Use the same pan for peppers to soak up flavors. Great way to save time. Leftover bacon? Toss it into salads. Variety opens more doors. Consider serving with crusty bread too. Balance between soft and crispy textures."
