ingredients:
- "3 small spiced squash or replace one with delicata for nutty hint"
- "Olive oil to brush"
- "1 medium yellow onion finely chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "2 tablespoons coconut oil or butter if preferred"
- "1.1 liters (4 2/3 cups) chicken stock or vegetable broth for vegan option"
- "2 tablespoons toasted pumpkin seeds plus extra for topping"
instructions:
- "Heat grill or barbecue high, oil grates well so squash won’t stick."
- "Cut squash into quarters, scrape out seeds, peel carefully with sharp peeler. Brush pieces evenly with olive oil."
- "Place on grill. About 4 ½ minutes each side until grill marks form and flesh softens slightly but doesn’t collapse. Cool enough to handle, then chop into medium cubes. Should yield roughly 9 cups chopped squash."
- "In heavy pot over medium heat melt coconut oil or butter until sizzles, toss in onions and garlic. Cook stirring often till translucent and fragrant, about 7 minutes. No browning here, just softening to bring out natural sweetness."
- "Add grilled squash and pour broth. Bring to rolling simmer. Reduce heat just enough to keep bubbling. Cook approximately 22 minutes, poke squash with fork — tender but not mushy."
- "Remove from heat, let cool briefly, transfer batchwise to blender. Purée until uniform and silky but thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season well with salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Taste, adjust as needed."
- "Serve hot with handful of toasted pumpkin seeds scattered on top for crunch and earthiness."
introduction: "Grilling squash before simmering adds a smoky depth I learned the hard way. Tried the oven once — bland. Grill marks mean caramelization, aroma hits before you even taste. Garlic and onions soften gently in fat, coaxing out natural sugars without turning bitter. Tried olive oil alone once, liked coconut oil for subtle coconut fragrance this time, a fresh twist. Stock choice shifts flavor. Chicken broth for richness but veggie broth if you want lighter, vegan-friendly. Watch squash texture closely — overcooking makes puree grainy, undercooking leaves fibrous chunks. Toasted pumpkin seeds on top? Crunch, nuttiness, contrast — don’t skip even if pressed for time."
ingredientsNote: "Use any spiced or small winter squash: delicata, acorn, kabocha work well in place of the courge poivrée. Peeling can be tedious; sharp peeler plus patience prevents waste. Brushing oil prevents grill sticking. Coconut oil here replaces butter for subtle aroma boost, but classic butter melts richer and coats onion and garlic better. Broth quantity slipped from original for better soup thickness, remember — broths vary in salt and concentration, add gradually and season near end. Pumpkin seeds toast quickly; keep an eye or they’ll burn and turn bitter. Salt and fresh black pepper essential — do not skimp. If no grill, char under broiler on oiled sheet but watch closely."
instructionsNote: "Prep squash carefully removing all seeds; leftover seeds can be toasted separately for snack. Grill on hot bars gives char and smoky odor; marks tell when to flip. Don’t go more than 5 minutes per side or it gets too soft and mushy. Onion and garlic cook slowly in fat to sweeten without browning — that bitterness ruins the base. Add squash cubes to warm pot before broth to retain heat and prevent shocking. Simmer to soften fully but not disintegrate —fork test helps here, tender but holds shape. Blend in batches for even purée, avoid over-blending, which makes soup gluey. Salt after blending since reduction concentrates flavors. Toasted pumpkin seeds add texture; toss in dry pan until just golden, stirring constantly. Bowl hot soup quickly, garnishing while still warm keeps seeds crisp. Leftovers reheat gently, add splash of broth if too thick."
tips:
- "Grill squash on very hot rack to get distinct marks. Watch closely, four to five minutes per side only. Too long and flesh softens too much. Peel before grilling for easier bite and consistent texture. Brushing oil keeps pieces from sticking, don’t skip."
- "Use coconut oil or butter to cook onions and garlic, heat medium. Aim for softness not color. Smells change too fast if burnt. Sweetness comes from slow sweating in fat. Onion must be translucent, garlic fragrant but raw bite gone."
- "Simmer with broth gently. Rolling boil can pulverize flakes and alter spongey texture. Test squash with fork; should give with pressure but hold shape without collapsing. Adjust broth quantity gradually depending on squash moisture and thickness preference."
- "Blending: use batches. Over-blending makes gluey texture. Better to have slight grain or texture than one uniform paste. Season after blender; salt intensifies after cooking and pureeing. Pepper fresh cracked adds brightness at the end."
- "Pumpkin seeds toast fast. Dry pan, medium heat, stir constantly. Dark spots mean burnt bitterness sets in instantly. Toast until just golden, smell nutty aroma turn mild brown, that’s time to pull off heat. Add late so crunch holds in hot soup."
faq:
- "q: What if no grill available? a: Use broiler for char. Oil sheet well. Watch carefully; broiler heat is harsh. Flip often for even marks. Can roast in oven covered but you lose smoky note."
- "q: Can I omit butter? a: Yes coconut oil works fine. Adds subtle fragrance without dairy. Butter melts better fat coats onion and garlic better, richer mouthfeel. Both work, depends on mood and diet."
- "q: Soup too thin after blending? a: Reduce by simmering with lid off. Or add less broth before blending next time. Puree thicker squash first. Add broth slowly, better gradual control than fixed amount."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Fridge in airtight container. Lasts few days. Reheat gently to avoid breaking texture. Add splash broth if too thick. Freeze in portioned tubs; thaw overnight in fridge and stir well before warming."
