ingredients:
- "===SMOKY CHILE OIL==="
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) smoked ground cumin"
- "===SOUP==="
- "4 large yellow bell peppers halved and deseeded"
- "1 small red onion chopped"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) olive oil plus extra for brushing"
- "1 litre (4 1/4 cups) vegetable broth"
- "3 medium Yukon gold potatoes peeled and diced"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) lemon juice"
instructions:
- "===SOUP==="
- "1. Heat olive oil in small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in smoked cumin quickly, no more than 1 minute until fragrant. Remove from heat. Set aside. Chili aroma tells me it’s ready, don’t burn or it’ll turn bitter."
- "2. Arrange oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat broiler to high. Line baking sheet with foil. Lightly oil pepper skins so they char instead of shrivel."
- "3. Place bell peppers cut side down. Broil 10 to 12 minutes until skins blister and blacken spotting. You’ll hear popping, smell that roasted scent. Transfer to sealed container or cover tightly to steam for about 20 minutes — loosens skin, makes peeling a breeze. No crying over black fingers."
- "4. Peel skins off peppers using fingers or a small knife. Rough chop flesh, avoid watery bits pooling inside."
- "5. In a deep pot, warm 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Sweat red onion until translucent, around 5 minutes. Smell sweetening layers. Stir often so no browning; caramelization here would change the flavor profile too much."
- "6. Add diced potatoes, roasted peppers, and veggie broth. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently. Watch for tiny bubbles at edges; vegetables soften in about 18 minutes. Test potatoes with fork, tender but not breaking apart."
- "7. Remove from heat. Use immersion blender or traditional blender to puree soup until nearly smooth but keep some texture for rustic mouthfeel. Add lemon juice to brighten flavors — important to cut richness."
- "8. Season with salt and freshly cracked pepper. Adjust acidity or seasoning to taste. Reheat gently if needed, no boil."
- "9. Serve in warmed bowls. Drizzle smoky chile oil deliberately — adds heat, oil richness, and that deep aroma popping off surface."
- "10. Optional garnish: fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley add freshness, or a swirl of coconut cream for subtle sweetness and extra silkiness."
introduction: "Yellow peppers. Roasted hard under broiler until charred black glints. Skin cracks, bubbles, smells smoky sharp. Peeling down to sweet flesh, soft and tender but firm. Potatoes added for body, Yukon gold gives creamy texture without flour. Onion sweats translucent, softens base. Broth simmers in, carries vegetal depth. Instead of paprika, smoky cumin gives warmth but more nuanced, less burnt bitterness. Vegetable stock replaces chicken to lighten flavors yet keep an earthy backbone. Final puree somewhere between silk and rustic, with just enough tooth. A swirl of chile oil finishes — aroma sets it apart, quiet heat lingers, teasing your nose. Lemon juice cuts through richness. I learned to watch peppers like a hawk broiling or skin tastes bitter. Timing, texture, aroma tell you when all align. Soup stays hearty but clean, with smoky layers you discover sip after sip."
ingredientsNote: "Yellow peppers chosen for sweetness and color contrast. Substitute with orange if yellow aren’t available, red lasts longer but base becomes sweeter. Yukon gold potatoes ideal for creamy texture without flouriness; russet can be used but may give a grainier mouthfeel. Onion can be swapped with shallots for milder aroma or leeks for subtle oniony tone. Replace vegetable broth with chicken broth to deepen flavor if desired, or mushroom broth for umami boost. Smoked cumin instead of paprika adds complexity and avoids overpowering bitterness some paprika brands have. Olive oil key to carry smoky notes; quality impacts final taste. Use a sturdy blender or immersion blender to control puree texture. Lemon juice vital to brighten the soup and cut richness; freshly squeezed always better. Brush peppers lightly with oil before broiling to promote blistering and prevent drying out. If skin refuses to peel, steam peppers longer or rub with damp cloth while warm."
instructionsNote: "Broiling peppers requires attentive eye — flames flare, skin bubbles fast. Move tray if parts blacken too swiftly. Steaming peppers post-broil crucial for easy peeling; trapped heat loosens skin quickly. Don’t skip sealing peppers immediately in airtight container or plastic wrap. Onion must sweat gently, no browning to avoid bitterness. Simmering time measured by potato tenderness not clock — poke with fork, want fork to slide in with slight resistance, not mushy. Puree texture subjective; rustic preferred here, so pulse briefly rather than blitz fully. Lemon juice added after pureeing to avoid curdling and retain brightness. Salt and pepper seasoning last because broth varies in saltiness. Drizzling chile oil last prevents it burning or losing vibrance in heat. If soup too thick, thin with broth or a splash of water. If too thin, simmer uncovered briefly to reduce. Garnish optional but herbs provide fresh bite balancing richness. Keep oil warm but not hot, reheating gently if needed. Avoid metallic containers for acidic lemon steps to prevent off-flavors."
tips:
- "Broil peppers close to heat source. Watch skin turn blistered, crackle sounds pop. Steam covered for 20 min right after broil — skin loosens fast, easier peeling. Skip steaming, skin clings. Don’t rush peeling or peel will tear meat inside. Oil skin lightly before broiling for good blister, stop shriveling."
- "Sweat onion gently over medium, no browning. Stir often, caramelizing ruins balance, turns bitter. Soft translucent is goal here. Soft onion builds base mouthfeel. Timing varies with pan temp, trust eye and smell: sweet onion aroma means ready."
- "Potatoes choice matters. Yukon gold keeps texture creamy, no graininess. Russet works but loses silk. Dice size uniform; large means uneven cooking. Simmer gently, poke potatoes with fork to check tenderness. Soft but hold shape. Watch broth skim bubbles, low simmer only to avoid breaking."
- "Puree body is critical. Pulse immersion blender short bursts. Velvety but not water-thin. Rustic bits add texture and interest. Lemon juice after blending brightens flavor sharply. Add slowly, taste often. Avoid curdling or harsh acid bite by adding post-puree, never during simmer."
- "Chile oil finish is key flavor hit. Use warm olive oil infused with smoked cumin, drizzle last, not during cooking. Keeps oil fresh, vibrant heat intact. Reheat gently if container cooled. Don’t burn oil or it turns bitter. Garnish herbs fresh and crisp contrast smoky, oily richness."
faq:
- "q: How to peel peppers easily? a: Steam right after broil, wrapping tight traps heat. Skin loosens fast, peels peel with fingers or knife edges. Skip steaming, tough peel clings stubborn. Timing matters to avoid cold sticky skin."
- "q: What if potatoes get mushy? a: Simmer low, check often. Uniform dice cooks evenly. If mushy starts, puree all for ultra smooth soup. Russet more prone to mush, Yukon gold holds better. Overcooking breaks texture fast."
- "q: Can I swap vegetable broth? a: Sure, chicken broth adds richness, mushroom broth boosts umami. Each changes flavor base, lighter or deeper. Adjust salt accordingly. Keep broth low sodium to control seasoning final taste."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, refrigerate airtight 3-4 days max. Freeze in portioned containers, lasts 2-3 months. Reheat gently on stove, stir often. Thin with broth if thickened too much. Lemon juice add fresh after reheating, avoid curdle."
