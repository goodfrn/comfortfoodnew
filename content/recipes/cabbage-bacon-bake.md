ingredients:
- "1 head green cabbage, chopped into half-inch strips"
- "1 medium sweet onion, sliced"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter, divided"
- "10 ounces canned condensed cream of mushroom soup"
- "1/2 cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese"
- "1/2 cup cooked bacon, crumbled"
- "1/4 cup mayonnaise"
- "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper"
- "1 cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese (for topping)"
- "1 sleeve Ritz crackers, crumbled"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 340°F. Lightly grease a 2-quart casserole dish with oil or shortening; set aside."
- "Melt 1/4 cup butter in large skillet over medium heat. Toss in cabbage and sliced onion. Sauté 6 to 10 minutes until cabbage softens and onions turn translucent but veggies still hold shape. Listen for gentle sizzling, smell the sweet onion aroma rising. Add garlic, cook 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant but not burnt."
- "Slide the veggies into a large bowl. Stir in cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, crumbled bacon, mayonnaise, salt, and pepper until combined. The mayo adds moisture and subtle tang. Taste mixture for seasoning here; adjust salt or pepper to preference."
- "Spread mixture evenly in prepared casserole dish. Set base layer."
- "Combine remaining 1/4 cup melted butter, 1 cup shredded cheddar, and crumbled Ritz crackers in a small bowl. This topping crisps during baking. Scatter evenly over cabbage layer."
- "Bake in center rack for about 25 to 35 minutes. Watch for bubbling edges and a golden-brown crust on top, creamy mixture shrinking slightly. Avoid overbaking to keep cabbage texture intact."
- "Remove from oven, let rest 10 minutes to set. The cooling stabilizes the layers; easier slicing. Sprinkle chopped flat-leaf parsley if available for color and freshness."
- "Serve warm. Holds well for leftovers, reheat covered in microwave but skip topping crispiness."
introduction: "Cabbage ain't usually first pick for casseroles but it holds surprises. Softened but not mushy is tricky; overcook and you lose cabbage’s snap. Adding bacon has always earned me nods at family dinners — smokey, salty bits contrast the creamy mix well. I dropped celery soup for mushroom; deeper flavor profile, richer. Garlic? Must. That fragrance hooking you before dipping spoon in. The Ritz crackers topping breaks the creamy monotony. If you’re intimidated by cabbage or worried about soggy mess, trust your eyes and nose during cooking. That golden crackly top? Sign you nailed it. The butter’s essential here, coating cabbage helping it soften gently and adding flavor. No shortcuts on butter; it’s the magic. This bake travels well, great make-ahead if you can resist snacking while waiting. I’ve tinkered with cheeses — gouda works but sharper cheddar cuts richness better. A simple but layered side or light main that actually feels worth it."
ingredientsNote: "Whole head cabbage works best, avoids watery sogginess that pre-shredded often causes. Slice your onion thick enough to get soft but not fade completely. Garlic must go in right at the end of the sautée to avoid bitterness; browned garlic ruins the batch. Butter really needs to be unsalted distinguishing from the added kosher salt; you’ll avoid oversalt. Swapping cream of celery soup for mushroom ups umami, but you can try cream of chicken for milder tones. Mayonnaise adds moisture without thinning the base; don’t substitute with sour cream or you risk curdling in the bake. Bacon brings salty crunch, but turkey bacon or pancetta can step in. Ritz crackers—crunchy, buttery, salty—are signature here. For topping, finely crush crackers rather than blitzing in a food processor to keep texture intact. Cheddar cheese can be sharper or milder depending on how intense you want final flavor. Parsley is optional but the freshness cuts richness."
instructionsNote: "Heat pan medium; too hot and cabbage burns before soft; too low, soggy mess. Watch cabbage’s color; slightly translucent edges, still a hint of green. Onion should look soft, not caramelized. Garlic goes in last minute max. Mixing ingredients off heat avoids curdling soup. Scrape bottom pan well; burnt bits make bitter notes. Spread mixture evenly but gently avoid smashing; layering traps moisture better. Topping is crucial; melted butter coats crackers preventing dryness, cheddar melts as glue. Bake till topping crackles and golden brown—if it’s pale after 25 mins, give it extra 5-7. Rest time not for cooling but setting; hot dish runs, serving mess. If topping burns too fast, tent foil halfway through baking. Leftovers reheat well but topping loses flair; consider broil to refresh crunch carefully. Watch salt through each stage; cream soups vary, always taste."
tips:
- "Butter balance crucial. Half melts for sautéing cabbage and onion; rest mixes with shredded cheddar and Ritz crumbs for topping. Keeps crackers from drying, cheese from burning. Butter not salted; kosher salt added separately avoids salt overload. Watch cabbage color, slight translucency, sell freshness. Overcooking kills snap; slows once onions turn translucent, listen for soft sizzle, not browning, garlic goes in last minute max, burnt garlic ruins batch."
- "Use cream of mushroom soup instead of celery or chicken. Mushroom deepens umami; chicken mellower if worried about strong flavor. Mayonnaise adds moisture, tang, but no sour cream swaps; curdling risk. Bacon brings crunch; turkey bacon or pancetta swap ok. Spread mix gently; smashing traps less moisture, layers dry out. Top with cracker mixture evenly; keep texture chunky, no blitzing. Finely crushed but still discernible Ritz adds signature crunch."
- "Oven temps and baking time flexible. 340°F medium heat suits well; watch bubbling edges, golden brown topping. Baking time 25–35 mins; if pale after 25, add 5–7 mins. Tent foil halfway if topping browns too fast. Rest bake 10 mins after oven off; helps solidify, clean slices. Watch cabbage texture inside; slight shrinkage signals done. Aroma changes: sweet onion, butter toasted Ritz, smoky bacon all come forward at doneness."
- "Onions sliced medium-thick; too thin vanish, too thick stay rubbery. Perfect onion softness means translucent, soft but visible. Garlic minced fine but added late to avoid bitterness. Stir ingredients in bowl off heat; avoid curdling soup or prematurely melting cheese. Scraping pan bottom important; burnt bits spoil flavor. Layering not pressing. Baking over low-medium heat for soft tender layers not mushy soggy."
- "Cheddar choice affects flavor impact. Sharp white or smoked gouda swaps ok. Sharp cuts richness but keep some mildness. Parsley optional; adds fresh green, cuts richness visually and palate-wise. Leftovers best reheated covered in microwave; topping loses crisp but flavors intact. Broiling briefly can refresh topping crunch but watch closely; burns fast. Keep salt fluid; cream soups vary, taste as you mix."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid soggy cabbage? a: Cook cabbage until just translucent edges, still some snap. Avoid over-sauté or overbake. Visual cues and texture key. Thick onion slices help keep moisture balance. Drain excess liquid if soup watery."
- "q: Can I substitute bacon? a: Turkey bacon or pancetta work but adjust salt. Bacon fat helps crispiness, flavor depth—if low fat, add small butter splash. Smoky flavor missing with lean swaps. Add smoked paprika if needed."
- "q: What about soup swap options? a: Cream of mushroom adds umami, chicken milder, celery stronger flavor. Mayonnaise moisture helps stabilize; don't swap sour cream, curdles in heat. Taste mixture before baking for salt balance; soups vary wildly."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool fully, cover tight. Fridge up to 3 days, reheat covered microwave to keep moisture. Topping crispiness dulls; broil quick to revive texture but watch often. Freeze not ideal; cracker topping soggy after thaw."
