ingredients:
- "500 grams small fingerling potatoes whole"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cups) asparagus tips, steamed crisp"
- "1/3 red onion thinly sliced"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) freshly chopped chives"
- "5 ml (1 teaspoon) chopped fresh tarragon"
- "120 grams smoked trout fillet, shredded"
- "trout roe or salmon eggs to garnish"
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "8 ml (1 1/2 teaspoons) grainy mustard"
- "15 ml (1 tablespoon) white wine vinegar"
- "7 ml (1 1/2 teaspoons) maple syrup"
- "85 ml (1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon) grapeseed oil"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "==="
- "1. Drop potatoes into plenty of salted boiling water. Watch for skin to loosen slightly and a fork slides in clean but not mushy. About 10-12 minutes depending on size. Drain. Plunge into ice water to shock and stop cooking - this keeps skins tight, yields more texture."
- "2. When cool, drain again. Cut each fingerling into quarters or halves if tiny. Place in a large bowl."
- "3. Meanwhile, steam asparagus just until vibrant green and still snap crisp, around 3 minutes. Rinse immediately under cold running water or ice bath to halt cooking. Drain well, pat dry."
- "4. Whisk mustard, vinegar, and maple syrup in small bowl. Slowly drizzle oil while whisking to emulsify. Season with salt and pepper - sharp acidity balanced with touch of sweet is key here, don’t overdo sweetness."
- "5. Add asparagus, thin onion slices, chives, and tarragon to potatoes. Pour vinaigrette over everything. Toss gently so potatoes don’t break apart, but dressing coats all surfaces evenly. Taste, adjust seasoning."
- "6. Plate salad on 4 plates or a large platter. Scatter flakes or thin ribbon strips of smoked trout over top. Spoon trout roe liberally as garnish – bursts of briny richness contrast creamy potatoes and vivid herbs."
- "Serve immediately or chill up to 1 hour. If chilling, bring to room temp before serving so flavors open. Leftover dressing? Great drizzled over steamed fish or roasted vegetable salad next day."
introduction: "Potatoes boiled just right—firm but yielding. No soggy mess. Crisp-tender asparagus tips from a steam basket, not waterlogged. Red onion sliced paper-thin, gives bite but doesn’t overpower. Chives and tarragon bring herbaceous brightness, fresh and punchy without fuss. Smoked trout here, swapping out salmon for a milder smoke, more subtle. Trout roe scattered on top offers those tiny pops, salty and unexpected. Dressing slapped together quick—mustard’s sharp tang, vinegar’s zing balanced by maple syrup instead of honey for deeper notes. Oil slicked in slowly till smooth. No mayo drowning this. Light, fresh, and not precious. A shortcut learned from too many overcooked veggies and chalky potatoes. Keep texture front and center. The act of tossing gently preserves it all, never mush. Leftovers transform chilled but never lose zip. I’ve made this a dozen times, ditching cream for sharpness, dialing down sweetness, finding that perfect edge that grabs your tongue. A salad, yes— but complex, layered, and real."
ingredientsNote: "Fingerling potatoes preferred for their waxy texture and thin skin, no peeling hassles here. Substitute with any baby potatoes but adjust cooking time as needed. Avoid starchy russets which crumble too much. Asparagus tips only; woody parts tough and fibrous—use them for stock or roasting elsewhere. Red onion sliced very thin, less bite that way—if you hate onion harshness, soak in cold water for 5 minutes to mellow it. Chives and tarragon replace the original dill and chives combo to lend a softer herbal vibe without overwhelming. Maple syrup instead of honey adds depth; if unavailable use mild honey. Grapeseed oil chosen for neutral taste and good emulsification; olive oil can overpower and cloud vinaigrette. Trout, smoked cold or hot works—try hot smoked if you want stronger flavor. Trout roe optional but worth seeking out for bursts of texture, salmon eggs okay substitute. Salt to taste, season carefully—potatoes can be bland but can also go salty fast if careless. Keep dressing ready but make just enough to lightly coat salad, no drowning."
instructionsNote: "Start potatoes in plenty of boiling salted water; salt seasons the potatoes from the inside while cooking. Test doneness by stabbing with fork—should pierce with slight resistance, firm but tender, not mushy. Plunging into ice bath immediately stops residual heat cooking them further; prevents sogginess and skin tearing. Cut when cooled enough to handle, drying them prevents salad from becoming watery. Asparagus steaming ensures bright green color, snap still intact; if overcooked, limp and dull flavor. Chill quickly after steaming to lock texture. Vinaigrette emulsified by slowly whisking oil into mustard-vinegar combo with maple for sweet balance. Toss salad gently with fork or tongs to avoid breaking potatoes; they’re fragile after cooking. Taste for seasoning before plating—vinegar sharpness and oil richness must balance well. Flaking smoked trout rather than chopping gives irregular texture and visual interest. Add roe last to keep distinct, not blended. Serve as soon as assembled to keep the crisp-tender contrast. If leftover and chilled, flavors meld but serve at room temp to bring back aromatics. Reheat not recommended; salad is meant fresh or cool."
tips:
- "Start potatoes in heavily salted boiling water. Salt goes in early, seasons inside. Boil till fork slides clean but still firm; test often. Ice bath right after—stops cooking suddenly; skin holds tight. Avoid letting potatoes sit warm or they get mealy and break apart."
- "Steam asparagus just till bright green and snap firm, about 3 minutes. Rinse immediately under cold water or ice bath. Keeps intense color, crisp bite. Overcook and you get limp, dull veggie. Dry well before dressing or it waters down salad."
- "Emulsify vinaigrette by whisking oil in slowly, not rushed. Grainy mustard key here, adds texture and depth. Maple syrup adds balance, sweeter than vinegar but darker notes than honey. Use grapeseed oil if can; olive often too heavy or cloudy."
- "Toss salad gently with fork or tongs. Potatoes fragile after cooking but still want coating on all surfaces. Don’t stir violent—breaks potatoes, mushy mess. Taste and add salt pepper slowly; potatoes soak salt fast or stay bland otherwise."
- "Flake smoked trout in irregular pieces for better texture and appearance. Thin ribbons also work but avoid chopping too fine. Add trout roe or salmon eggs last; those bursts of briny pop stay intact if you add them at very end."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute other fish for smoked trout? a: Yes, cold or hot smoked salmon works too but stronger flavor. Hot smoked trout gives bolder taste; cold smoked is milder. Milder white fish less common but possible. Adjust amount based on smoke intensity."
- "q: What if I overcook potatoes? a: Mushy potatoes ruin texture contrast, become gluey when tossed. Rescue if slight overcook—drain well, chill quickly to firm up. Avoid stirring too much or they just break further. Might use for mash instead if totally falling apart."
- "q: How long can leftovers last? a: Refrigerate up to 24 hours. Salads with vinaigrette soak in flavors but veggies lose snap after day. Best to chill separate if possible. Bring to room temp before serving, flavors open and soften. Reheat not recommended; kills contrast."
- "q: Can I use different herbs? a: Tarragon plus chives replace dill; no dill here. Basil or parsley possible but change flavor profile. Tarragon adds slight anise note, softer than dill’s punch. Freshness matters; dried herbs lose brightness in vinaigrette. Adjust amounts."
