title: "Sesame Seared Tuna Volcano"
slug: "sesame-seared-tuna"
description: "Searing thick tuna steaks encrusted with mixed sesame seeds for a crust that snaps. Volcano sauce blends mayo with chili paste and a surprising touch of condensed milk, balancing heat with sweetness. Cooking over high heat triggers the sizzle, the spitting oil, and those telltale aromas that say 'almost there'. Adjust chili in the sauce gradually or swap out condensed milk for coconut cream to cut sweetness differently. Timing’s approximate; rely on surface color, firmness under finger. Garnish with scallions for a fresh pop. Teriyaki glaze slips on just before serving, sticky and rich. Sauce piped or dotted on side, personal heat dial on spoil. Smoke alarm diplomacy essential."

ogDescription: "Thick tuna packed in sesame seeds sears with crackle. Volcano sauce builds heat slow; teriyaki glaze melts warm top. Scallions add fresh crunch punch."

ingredients:
- "For volcano sauce==="
- "1/3 cup mayonnaise"
- "2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce (add gradually)"
- "2 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk (substitute coconut cream if preferred)"
- "1/2 teaspoon fine sugar"
- "For tuna==="
- "4 tuna steaks about 1 1/2 inch thick"
- "1 tablespoon white sesame seeds"
- "1 tablespoon black sesame seeds"
- "1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil (can sub grapeseed or avocado oil)"
- "Teriyaki glaze (store-bought or homemade)"
- "Chopped scallions for garnish"
instructions:
- "Blast chili garlic sauce little by little into mayo. Blend small food processor or immerse blender. Watch the heat climb; stop somewhere you won’t regret."
- "Mix sesame seeds in a flat dish. Press tuna both sides in seeds so they stick like armor. Seeds add crunch and that nutty toasty smell once seared."
- "Heat oil till almost smoking hot in big frying pan or cast iron. You want that crackle before the fish goes in."
- "Drop tuna in carefully. Oil will spit like it hates you. Cover pan to trap heat but watch so it doesn’t overshoot."
- "Cook 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium rare; push shorter for rarer. Thickness is king. Peek if you must. Look for a dark crust encasing deep red inside."
- "Pull tuna off heat. Rest a bit—don’t wreck those juicy interiors."
- "Slather teriyaki glaze on top while warm so it melts sleek and sticky."
- "Volcano sauce — option one: dollop on side for dipping. Option two: pipe thin streams or dots using a small snip on a corner of a sealed plastic bag. Adds drama and control over spice."
- "Finish with scallions sprinkled like confetti."
- "No shame if smoke alarm goes off. It’s a sign you’re searing right. Just clear air quickly and get ready to devour."
introduction: "High heat searing can either make you a kitchen hero or a frustrated cook. Tuna steak coated in cracked white and black sesame seeds doesn’t just get flavor—it snaps audibly before your eyes. The volcano sauce? A gamble every time. Mayo's cream, chili garlic's punch, and condensed milk’s odd sweetness wrestle for your palate’s attention. Adjust slowly and keep tasting—it’s not a race. The teriyaki glaze sits on top like a sweet umami armor, catching juices escaping during rest time. Timing approximates. Thickness varies so visual cues guide you. Oil crackles, smoke rises, fish firms but stays ruby inside. Scallion garnish adds fresh crunch and color. Cooking isn’t precise. It’s sensory. Eyes, ears, nose, fingers… learn the signs."
ingredientsNote: "Mayonnaise can be swapped with Greek yogurt for lighter creaminess but loses some fat richness. Chili garlic sauce is usually fiery; go easy and build heat gradually to avoid overwhelming. Sweetened condensed milk tames the sauce’s bite but coconut cream is a legit substitute if dairy isn’t your jam—adds subtle coconut sweetness and extra creaminess. Sesame seeds crackle better toasted dry briefly in a pan, but raw are fine if your pan is hot enough to do the job. Tuna steaks should be thick—under an inch and you risk overcooking the inside before seeds brown nicely. Vegetable oil is preferred for high heat tolerance but grapeseed or avocado oils can offer higher smoke points and a subtle flavor twist. Teriyaki glaze store-bought works but homemade with soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and ginger is more authentic and fresher. Scallions for garnish aren’t optional in my kitchen—a must for color and crisp texture contrast."
instructionsNote: "Start with your volcano sauce: blending mayo, chili paste, condensed milk, and sugar. The slow chili addition is key here; you can always add but can’t take away heat—taste test on a small spoon frequently. Dredge the tuna thickly and evenly with sesame seeds—press seeds firmly so they stick but avoid moisture or excess oil on fish surface that could disrupt the crust. Heat the oil well before tuna hits—when it’s just smoking, drop steaks in and listen for a sharp sizzle that tells you sealing is underway. Covering traps heat but watch closely; too long and those seeds burn to bitterness. Flip carefully—flip only once—maintain crust integrity. Rely on color change from tonal contrast of dark crust to bright pink interior; estimation purpose 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes each side depends on thickness. Rest tuna briefly; carryover heat finishes gently without drying out. Slather teriyaki glaze immediately to marry sweet-salty flavors while still hot. Volcano sauce presentation is a choice: do you want rustic dollops or that cheeky refined drizzle from a plastic bag snip? Garnish confidently but sparingly with scallions for bite and eye appeal. Be ready with ventilation—hot oil spitting is not a joke."
tips:
- "Add chili garlic sauce gradually into mayo. Heat builds fast here; stop often to taste. Can overdo spice quick. Condensed milk or coconut cream tames bite differently. Always test small spoon. Texture smooth but thick; no lumps."
- "Sesame seeds need press firm on tuna; dry surface works best. Toast dry in pan if unsure; raw works if pan is hot enough. Both black and white for nutty depth and visual interest. Seed clumps ruin crust—break with fingers or sift."
- "Oil must be near smoking but not burning. Use vegetable, grapeseed, or avocado for smoke point. Olive oil ruins sear with off taste. Drop tuna gently; anticipate sizzling oil that spits. Cover pan but watch closely to prevent overcooking crust."
- "Cook time varies by thickness. Aim 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes each side. Look for dark crust outside with ruby-pink center. Press lightly; firm but yielding. Rest tuna a few minutes off heat to carry over heat gently without drying out."
- "Teriyaki glaze applied when still warm sticks slick and glossy. Can be store-bought or homemade with soy, mirin, sugar, and ginger. Volcano sauce served either dolloped on side or piped with bag snip. Scallions sprinkled last for sharp fresh color and bite."
faq:
- "q: How to tell tuna doneness? a: Eye on crust color; deep brown marks crisp while inside stays bright red or pink. Firmness matter; poke with finger, soft then springy means medium rare. Overcook and it goes dull, dry."
- "q: What if sauce too spicy? a: Dial back chili garlic paste slow. Add more mayo or swap condensed milk with coconut cream for mild sweetness and creaminess. Taste after each add. Spoon test; too hot, balance with sugar or dairy."
- "q: Oil spitting problems? a: Heat too high or wet fish surface. Pat dry tuna well. Use high smoke point oil only. Cover pan traps heat but watch burning risk. Splatter shield helps but expect crust loss crispness; prioritise safety or crust."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap tuna tightly, keep in fridge max 1 day. Volcano sauce separate in airtight. Reheat low and quick or serve cold; avoids drying out. Teriyaki glaze can be reapplied fresh if dried or sticky on stored fish."
