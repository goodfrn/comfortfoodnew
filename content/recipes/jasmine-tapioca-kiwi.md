ingredients:
- "500 ml (2 cups) oat milk"
- "40 g (about 4 tablespoons) quick-cooking tapioca pearls"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) coconut cream"
- "70 g (slightly less than 1/3 cup) sugar"
- "4 jasmine tea bags"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) plain dairy or plant-based yogurt"
- "4 golden kiwis, peeled and chunked"
- "Honey or agave syrup for drizzling"
instructions:
- "Off heat, mix 500 ml oat milk with tapioca. Let soak. Tapioca swells—watch for pearls becoming plumper, not mushy."
- "In separate saucepan, bring remaining oat milk, coconut cream and sugar to near boil. Sugar dissolves silently; tiny bubbles cluster edges. Remove from heat."
- "Drop tea bags in, steep 12 minutes. Tea releases jasmine perfumes, earthy and floral, infusing cream mixture. Remove bags, squeeze gently, discard."
- "Stir infused cream mix into soaked tapioca. Medium heat, constant stirring—tickling, thickening, pearls turn glossy translucent. Should take about 4 minutes simmer, tapioca soft but with bite."
- "Off heat, cool 20 minutes stirring occasionally to avoid film on top. Then transfer to bowl, cover surface tightly with plastic wrap to block skin. Chill 3-4 hours."
- "Before serving, stir tapioca to loosen. Spoon into bowls, dollop yogurt atop, scatter kiwi pieces. Drizzle honey or agave to taste, adds bright sweetness against creamy base."
introduction: "Started messing with tapioca years ago. Always tricky—too soft, too gritty, never just right. Jasmine tea infusion? Adds unexpected notes, floral but not overpowering. Coconut cream swap changed game—richer, silkier. Using oat milk keeps it lighter, plant-based, no dairy worries. Golden kiwis popped up at market; their sweetness cuts acidity, smooth texture, unlike green kiwis which dominate. Yogurt gives that tang; honey drizzle finishes perfect. Talk textures. Tapioca pearls bubble, swell, jiggle when done. Look for almost translucent pearls, no raw chalky center. The smell, that jasmine aroma fills kitchen, reminds me why patience with infusion matters. Play with timings. Can simmer slightly less for chewier, few mins longer for total softness. Chill time firmed mine perfectly; tapioca clumps if rushed. Great dessert that’s also refreshing—summer evenings, no fuss. Experiment and own it, tapioca’s forgiving once you learn its signals."
ingredientsNote: "Swap dairy cream for coconut cream if avoiding dairy or seeking tropical twist—adds richness without heaviness. Tapioca pearls vary by brand; quick-cooking ones speed things but watch soak times closely. Soak tapioca well in cold milk before heat to avoid clumps and gritty textures. Golden kiwi brings natural sweetness and smooth flesh, ideal here; green ones harsher, tangier but works if you like that. Sugar amount flexible, can replace with maple syrup or agave—adjust for sweetness preference. Jasmine tea bags infuse subtle floral tones, but if unavailable, switch to mild green or white tea bags. Yogurt is key for contrast; plain plain or plant-based options both work. Honey drizzle provides balanced finish; agave or maple syrup are good alternatives, especially vegan. Keep extra milk ready—if tapioca thickens too fast or dries, add splash mid-cook to keep creamy consistency."
instructionsNote: "Off heat soaking of tapioca ensures pearls absorb liquid evenly, prevents lumping. Be patient with infusion; jasmine aroma must deepen, steep longer if weak, but avoid bitterness—oversteeped tea sours flavor. Stir constantly after combining tapioca and tea cream mix, pearls stick otherwise, burn risk. Watch tapioca texture, pearls should become translucent with tiny white center fading but remain intact. Turn off heat just when ready; residual heat finishes softening. Cooling with plastic wrap pressed on surface blocks unwanted film and oxidation, keeps tapioca silky. Chill minimum 3 hours best for set texture; shorter leaves pearls loose, less cohesive but fine if in a hurry. Before serving, breaking tapioca gently prevents gluey clumps. Final assembly balances creaminess, tang, and fresh fruit brightness. Drizzle honey last minute to prevent sinking and keep that glossy shine. Keep leftover tapioca refrigerated tightly sealed, consumes within 24 hours to avoid fermentation."
tips:
- "Soak tapioca in cold oat milk off heat first; key to avoiding lumps and gritty bits. Wait for pearls to puff up, get translucent but not mushy. Stir occasionally, watch those tiny pearls swell visually. Timing differs per brand; some need longer soak. Start gentle, no heat yet. This sets texture baseline before heat softens further."
- "Infuse jasmine tea slowly in warm coconut cream mix off boil. Avoid bitterness by not oversteeping. Smell shifts from floral to earthy if steep too long. Remove bags gently, squeeze just a little to get flavor out but skip strong tannins. Jasmine scent signals readiness. Cool briefly before mixing with tapioca soaked milk or pearl cook will turn gluey."
- "Combine soaked tapioca and infused cream on medium heat. Stir constantly—nonstop swirl motion prevents pearls from sticking or scorching bottom. Texture changes: glossy pearls with faint white centers shrinking in opacity. Usually about 4 minutes simmer tops. Listen for light bubble sound; avoid rolling boil which breaks chewy texture, pearls pop and get mealy instead."
- "Cooling step often skipped but vital. Off heat, stir while cooling 20 minutes to stop skin forming; then seal with plastic wrap right on tapioca surface. Blocks oxidation, keeps pudding silky without dry film. Chill minimum 3 hours for firmness. If rushed, pearls stay loose and pudding watery. Slow firming molds pearl structure without clumping glue."
- "Golden kiwis work best for natural sweetness and smooth flesh. Green counterparts add tang but can clash with creamy notes. Use fresh, peeled, roughly chunked pieces scattered last minute to keep pop and texture contrast. Yogurt scatters on top, adds tangy balance to rich cream and honey finishes with subtle floral sweetness. Drizzle right before serving to keep shine and avoid sinking."
faq:
- "q: How to tell tapioca is cooked? a: Pearls turn glossy translucent; white cores shrink but pearls remain whole. Feel for soft but slightly chewy texture. Overcook and pearls burst open, mushy. Under cook leaves chalky center. Watch bubbles reduce, simmer quiets down near end."
- "q: Can use different tea? a: Yes but jasmine best here. Mild green or white teas work—less floral but still fragrant. Avoid black or strong teas; can overpower creamy base. Steep time may vary; taste often to prevent bitterness. Herbal teas not recommended; no tannins so infusion weak."
- "q: Why tapioca clump sometimes? a: Usually from not soaking enough off heat or stirring too late. Tapioca swells best in cold milk first. Heating too soon locks them stiff, clumps form. Also constant stirring after adding cream mix vital. Skip it, pearls stick and burst unevenly. Add splash of milk mid-cook if too thick."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Keep refrigerated, airtight container only. Tapioca pudding thickens in fridge and firms up more overnight. Consume within 24 hours—can ferment or sour if left longer especially with yogurt topping. Re-stir well before serving. Add milk splash if too stiff. Avoid freezing, pearls lose texture."
