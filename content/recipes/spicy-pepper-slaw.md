ingredients:
- "5 cups coleslaw mix"
- "1 medium red onion, thinly sliced"
- "1 large ripe tomato, diced"
- "½ cup mayonnaise"
- "1½ tablespoons hot pepper sauce, adjust to taste"
- "¾ teaspoon salt"
- "½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Combine cabbage mix, sliced onion, and chopped tomato in large bowl. Toss to blend textures and colors."
- "In smaller bowl, whisk mayo with 1½ tablespoons pepper sauce. Start light; can add more later. Aim for creamy but punchy. Add salt and black pepper next. Mix thoroughly until evenly combined with no streaks."
- "Pour dressing over veggies. Toss vigorously but gently—you want coating, not soggy mess."
- "Feel the texture still a bit firm, dry. Don’t panic. Cover slaw. Chill 15–25 minutes. Watch juices release from cabbage, mingle with dressing. It thickens, flavors deepen."
- "Stir again before serving. Taste and tweak salt, pepper, or heat. Add a splash more mayo if too fiery; more sauce if you dare."
- "Serve cold, crisp, with any grilled meats or as bold standalone snack."
introduction: "Cabbage and heat. Not your usual bland slaw. I’ve tried sweet mayo combos that drown flavor sauce. Nope. This pepper-infused dressing hits like a surprise. The tomato and red onion add pops of freshness that cut through creamy texture. When you toss everything and chill, liquid from cabbage softens raw edges—creates this unforced marriage of heat and crunch. I always start with less pepper sauce. Learned the hard way not to go full throttle initially. Cool rest time crucial—I’ve seen too many rushed slaws stay sad and dry. Once rested, flavors really come together. This slaw’s got attitude and texture. No filler, no fancy tricks. Just bold and straight to the point—southern heat meets garden crunch and creamy zip. Good ‘n thick enough without drowning veg, which I keep rigid, crisp. Perfect for summer grills or when you want something with a bit of snap but no fuss."
ingredientsNote: "The coleslaw mix can be bagged or homemade—try shredding green and purple cabbage for color contrast. Often, shredded carrots sneak in but tomatoes here swap sweetness for tang. Red onion sharpens, but a sweet yellow would mellow if preferred. Mayonnaise is mayo—store-bought is fine but homemade mayo boosts creaminess. Pepper sauce—Frank’s or your local hot sauce—adjust based on heat preference. If you’re out of mayo, Greek yogurt can lighten things but will change texture to thinner. Salt and black pepper are key seasonings; don’t skip the fresh grind black pepper—it cuts through creaminess nicely. Tomato ripe but firm—not mush or the slaw turns watery. Onion thinly sliced so no overpowering chunks—balance important."
instructionsNote: "No overmixing. Toss just enough to coat cabbage evenly; mush ruins fresh crunch and brings bitter juices out. Use a sturdy bowl for heavy tossing. Whisk pepper sauce and mayo well to blend evenly, no blobs. You want a harmonized dressing that clings easily. After coating veg, chill uncovered initially to see moisture change; then cover to prevent fridge odors. The chilling rest is the silent workhorse here—don't skip. It softens cabbage’s raw edge, lets dressing marry veg juices into a united whole. Stir before serving—always taste last, adjust salt, heat, or creaminess. If slaw gets too intense after chilling, scoop some off to cool with added mayo. If too mild, add a splash more hot sauce. This recipe is forgiving but expects your attention on balance and texture rather than strict timing. Hands-on senses win every time. The hint of tomato literally wakes the salad up; wedge it well to keep chunks distinct. And keep slaw cold till plated for best bite."
tips:
- "Slice onions thin—mandoline best if you have it. Uneven onion chunks wreck bite balance. Use sharp knife if no mandoline. Sharpness varies by thickness so watch. Onion flavor punches. Cut too thick get overpowering chunks. Thin makes crisp tones intact."
- "Chill uncovered first. Watch cabbage juice surge, dressing thickens. Texture shift crucial. Don’t skip resting phase. Covers trap fridge smells. So first 15 minutes wait open bowl then cover tight for next step. Rest softens raw edges but saves crunch."
- "Use fresh grind black pepper always. Pre-ground pepper kills zip here. Pepper cuts creamy mayo, adds bite. Adjust heat by pepper sauce amount but black pepper crucial background layer. Try mixing mayo with Greek yogurt if mayo not available but note thinner texture comes."
- "Don’t overmix slaw when tossing dressing. Enough to coat, avoid mushing veg. Mushy slaw loses crunch, releases bitter cabbage juice. Toss vigorously but gentle; heavy mixing breaks texture. Use sturdy bowl to toss without spilling dressing everywhere."
- "If slaw feels dry after chilling add extra mayo splash or hot sauce splash depending on heat preference. Slaw heats slightly subside chilling but adjust heat warm or cold. Swap tomato with cucumber slices to keep crunch but reduce moisture if drier slaw wanted."
faq:
- "q: Can I use sweet onion instead of red? a: Yes but flavor changes. Sweet onion mellows sharp notes. Brightness drops. Texture same though. Slice same thinness keep balance. Sometimes better for milder palette."
- "q: What if slaw is watery after resting? a: Drain juice or add more mayo to bind loose moisture. Toss again gently. Can also chill longer uncovered to evaporate excess liquid. Watch timing depends on cabbage freshness and humidity."
- "q: How long can I store leftovers? a: Up to 24 hours tops. After that, slaw softens too much. Flavors intensify but texture flops. Store covered in fridge. Stir once before serving next day. Adding fresh dressing day two helps brightness."
- "q: Can I substitute pepper sauce with sriracha? a: Yes, sriracha gives smoky heat with sweeter layer. Chipotle also good smoky call. Adjust amount upfront; sriracha can be thicker, spicier in different ways. Taste before tossing full batch."
