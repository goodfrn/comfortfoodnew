title: "Pimento Mac Cheese Squares"
slug: "pimento-mac-cheese-squares"
description: "Cheesy macaroni baked into squares. Uses bullion cubes for a punch of flavor. Includes pimentos for color and subtle tang. Baked uncovered until most moisture evaporates, edges get a slight crust. Ready to slice once the middle firms up. Classic comfort food, but with a practical twist using eggs to help bind. Milk thins out the cheese mix for even coating. Textured bites with sharp cheddar richness, dotted with soft pimentos. Good for portioned snacks or a side. The reserved cheddar on top sharpens crispiness while baking. Simple pantry staples mostly, easy to pull together on busy nights. Adjust timing based on visual ‘set’ not just the clock."

ingredients:
- "1 cup elbow macaroni"
- "2 bullion cubes crushed (originally 3, reduced to 2 for subtle salt)"
- "1 1/2 cups milk (sub half and half for creamier texture)"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese (reserve 1/2 cup for topping)"
- "1/2 cup diced pimentos"
- "nonstick cooking spray"
- "optional twist add: 1/4 cup cooked crispy bacon pieces"
instructions:
- "Start boiling water. Cook macaroni just until al dente; tender but still firm. Drain well; wet pasta waters will kill the bake by making it too soupy."
- "While pasta steams dry, crush bullion cubes in a medium bowl with back of a spoon or fork until powdery. Add milk and eggs; whisk together vigorously until fully blended. This mix baths the pasta with salty creaminess and helps binder the eggs firm up the custard base."
- "In bowl, reserve 1/2 cup cheddar cheese—set aside for topping. Stir remaining cheddar in with pimentos and drained macaroni. Get everything evenly coated; you want the cheese to almost melt into pasta lumps, with pimento bits scattered throughout."
- "Spray 8x8 dish lightly. Pour mixture in evenly. Sprinkling reserved cheddar on top creates a crusty golden lid when baked, adds to texture contrast."
- "Slide into oven preheated to 350°F. You'll know it's ready when edges pull away slightly, the top bubbles gently, and poking center shows firmness not jiggle. Expect 25–30 minutes but check visually around 20 min for first signs. If top browns too fast, cover loosely with foil to prevent burning."
- "Pull out, cool about 10 minutes to let custard firm fully; easier to slice cleanly then. Hot out the oven is tempting but too soft. Served warm or room temp—nice cheesy snap, not squishy mess."
- "For last minute swaps: bullion can be swapped for powdered chicken or veggie broth; eggs can be scaled back to one if pressed but expect softer squares; milk can do whole or a splash cream for richness. Pimentos replaced by roasted red peppers or green chiles for smoky bite."
- "Bacon twist? Adding it before baking introduces crisp salty bursts. Mix in with pasta step. You can also sprinkle on top with extra cheddar."
- "Common trap is overcooked pasta – mushy bake results. Drain well and watch pasta cooking tightly. Another issue is too much liquid; adjust by adding a little more cheese or waiting longer to bake until set by feel."
introduction: "Caught on the fixation of curling macaroni just right. Over years, learned that texture drives success more than exact minutes. The firm snap of al dente counters creamy melted cheese—balance crucial. Eggs? Not just fillers but kings of texture control. Without them, mix runs wild and slices turn gloopy mess. Bulllion cubes for seasoning, crush them fine to avoid salty clumps. Pimentos throw color and a mild tang, breaks monotony of cheese. Once baked till top crisps golden, edges curl up with inviting crunch. Smells waft out, sharp cheddar singing. Cooling time ignored and you lose slice shape. Tried swaps like roasted peppers—adds earthiness but skews traditional charm. Bacon pieces? Insider trick caught from late night snacking experiments—salty contrast lifts it beautifully."
ingredientsNote: "Macaroni elbows best for baking due to shape and bite; retain sauce inside each curve. Bulllion cubes crush easily between spoons, warming mixture unleashes flavor release. Milk provides the base liquidity—using half and half or cream thickens texture considerably but increases calories. Eggs fundamental for firming mixture upon baking; skipping or reducing leads to crumbling squares. Sharp cheddar top creates a browned, crunchy crown. Pimentos soft with bright color; substitute roasted red peppers or green chiles for kick. Adding cooked bacon pieces throws depth and crunch but expect extra grease—pat dry before mixing. Spray baking dish lightly to avoid cheese glue-stuck scenarios. For dairy-free, experiment with plant milk and vegan cheese but expect textural differences. Salt control lies mostly in bullion—taste before adding extra seasoning."
instructionsNote: "Start with boiling water for macaroni—don’t overcook, aim for toothsome bite. Drain pasta thoroughly—wet pasta ruins bake fluid balance. Crushing bullion cubes finely prevents gritty texture; whisking milk and eggs until smooth ensures even coating, critical for uniform bake and no pockets of dryness or watery patches. After mixing pasta with cheese and pimentos, spreading evenly in baking dish avoids uneven cooking spots. Reserved cheddar topping browns to provide texture and flavor contrast. Keep a close eye near baking end—look for bubbling edges and firm center that resists jiggle. If top starts browning too quickly, tent lightly with foil to avoid burnt taste. Post-bake cooling lets custard set, important for neat slicing. Serve warm, not hot—still intact but melty. Overbaking causes dryness, underbaking leads to collapse. Adjust bake time and liquid ratios based on your oven and freshness of ingredients. Efficient: prepare mix while pasta cooks to save time."
tips:
- "Start boiling water first; macaroni needs just al dente texture. Overcooking means mushy. Drain pasta aggressively. Wet pasta waters ruin bake texture big time. Think pasta grip; that bounce when you bite signals right cook stage. Keeps shape in bake."
- "Bullion cubes crushed fine prevents gritty bites. Crush with back of spoon or fork, then mix right away with milk and eggs. Whisk vigorously till just smooth. This coats pasta evenly. Eggs firm custard base during bake. Don’t skip or reduce much or squares get crumbly, loose."
- "Reserve some sharp cheddar for top layer. Sprinkled on final mix turns golden crust in oven. Adds kick, chew contrast to soft cheesy inside. If top browns too quick, loosely tent foil mid-bake. Bake time varies with oven, moisture. Visual cues matter — bubbling edges, firm center you can poke without jiggle."
- "Pimentos bring mild tang and color pops. Substitute roasted red peppers or green chiles for smoky or spicy note. Cooked bacon bits mixed in before baking add crunch and salt bursts but can release more grease. Pat dry bacon before adding or top with extra cheese to balance."
- "Cooling post-bake crucial. Hot out of oven squares too soft. Ten minutes wait firms custard fully; clean slices follow. Skip cooling and edges crumble, squish mess. Use nonstick spray to avoid stuck bits in pan. Prep mix while pasta cooks for timing efficiency."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent soggy mac cheese squares? a: Drain pasta very well. Wet strands release water during bake. That causes soupy mess, no crust. Dry pasta bite holds shape better. Also watch bake time, moisture levels in milk/cream; too much liquid messes custard texture."
- "q: Can I substitute bullion cubes? a: Sure. Use powdered chicken or veggie broth powder. Adjust salt needed carefully. Bullion controls salt mostly. Powder blends easier but taste varies. Remember, broth powder might need extra stirring to dissolve fully in milk-egg mix."
- "q: What if I skip eggs or reduce? a: Eggs act as binder holding custard firm. Less eggs means softer, more fragile squares. Might crumble on slicing. Could try adding a bit of flour or starch, but texture changes. Experiment to see what your oven and ingredients do."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Lasts 3–4 days cold. Reheat covered in oven or microwave but watch moisture—use foil to avoid drying top out. Freeze possible; wrap well. Thaw fully before reheating for even warming. Texture slightly softer after freezing."
