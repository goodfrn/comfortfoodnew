instructions:
- "Lightly wet the rim of a chilled martini glass with water or a few drops of almond milk."

introduction: "Dark chocolate meets hazelnut, almond milk replaces cream. A quick shake, a frosty rim coated with bittersweet grated chocolate instead of cream. Nutella gives a sticky sweet twist, no dairy needed. Nutty liqueur joins vodka, blending into a silky dark pool. Rich but not too heavy. Garnished with cocoa dust and shards of dark chocolate. Perfect after a long day or when you want chocolate but stronger. Creaminess from almond milk keeps it light and nutty. Steps quick, no mess. All ingredients mingle in one hardy shake. That’s it. Chill, savor, repeat if you must."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping cream Gianduia for Nutella adds a hazelnut-rich layer without extra dairy. Grated dark chocolate on the rim gives crunch and bittersweet welcome before the sips. Almond milk lightens the body, lending subtle nuttiness that echoes the liqueur. Frangelico or alternative hazelnut liqueurs boost the aroma and complexity. The dark chocolate syrup substitutes the milk chocolate, intensifying cocoa notes and balancing sweetness. Keep the alcohol balanced; vodka’s neutrality highlights the other flavors. No eggs, gluten, or nuts aside from hazelnut liqueur and Nutella—adjust if nut allergies present. Easy pantry staples, minimal prep."
instructionsNote: "Start by wetting the rim gently, don’t overdo it or chocolate won’t stick well. Spread grated chocolate thin and even for a crunchy, textured rim. Shake firmly with ice to chill and mix without diluting too much. Strain with care—use a fine mesh if possible to avoid ice shards. Garnish swiftly, cocoa powder settles fast, so serve at once. The cocktail is best sipped cold, allowing flavors to develop on the palate—nutty, creamy, chocolatey with sharp vodka punch. No muddling, no layering, pure shake and strain simplicity. Clean glassware enhances the visual. Prep time within 6 minutes tops."
tips:
- "Wet the rim. Not too much though. Use water or almond milk. Then dip in grated chocolate. Even coating gives better crunch. Don’t rush this step."
- "Shake it strong. Ice cubes keep it cold. Blend hazelnut liqueur and vodka well. 30 seconds minimum. Chill the entire drink for smoothness. Don’t skip or overdo it."
- "Serve right away. Cocoa powder settles fast. Garnish quickly. Stir it gently if needed. Let flavors blend in the sip. Enjoy the crunch of chocolate rim."
- "Use a fine mesh strainer. Keeps ice shards out. Never want diluted chocolate flavor. Straining helps with smoothness in each sip you take. Pour carefully."
- "Try different liqueurs. Frangelico is classic, but others work too. Experiment with flavors, see what you like. Each liqueur brings its own twist."
faq:
- "q: Can I use regular milk instead of almond a: Yes but may change texture. Almond milk lighter. Creamier if use whole milk though. Keep in mind flavors."
- "q: What if I don't have chocolate syrup a: Use melted dark chocolate instead. More richness. Add sweetness with sugar or honey. Adjust to taste. Possible to mix flavors."
- "q: How to store leftovers a: Chill in fridge. Shake again before serving. Best fresh but still okay for few hours. Don’t leave out too long. Chocolate can spoil."
- "q: How to make it less sweet a: Reduce chocolate syrup amount. More vodka gives less sweetness. Adjust liqueur too. Explore different ratios, find your balance."
