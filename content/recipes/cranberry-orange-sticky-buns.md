slug: "cranberry-orange-sticky-buns"
description: "Sweet yeasted dough with a tangy cranberry-orange topping bakes into sticky buns. Uses scalded whole milk to coax the yeast awake. Butter-sugar mixture melds with fresh cranberries, orange zest, and juice for a bright, sticky base. Dough rolled thin, layered with a cinnamon-brown sugar sprinkle, then sliced and arranged over the fruit topping to rise again. Baking until golden, flipping out before serving locks in the sticky chaos underneath. A tweak with coconut oil replaces shortening for a subtle nutty note, balancing tart and sweet beautifully."
metaDescription: "Cranberry-Orange Sticky Buns bake up tender layers with tart fruit and sticky syrup. Yeast proofed in scalded milk, coconut oil replaces shortening for texture and flavor balance."
ogDescription: "Sticky buns loaded with cranberries and orange zest. Tangy, gooey, and baked golden. Uses scalded milk and coconut oil to wake yeast and add subtle nuttiness."

ingredients:
- "1 cup whole milk"
- "2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast"
- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2 1/2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1/4 cup melted coconut oil instead of shortening"
- "6 tbsp unsalted butter divided"
- "1/2 cup light corn syrup"
- "1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries"
- "zest and juice of 1 large orange"
- "3/4 cup packed brown sugar"
- "2 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
instructions:
- "Warm whole milk in microwave ~1 minute until steaming but not boiling; this scald activates enzymes to improve yeast action."
- "In mixer bowl with dough hook, combine yeast, sugar, salt swirling together. Pour hot milk over. Rest 10-12 minutes until yeast foams and smells sweetly yeasty."
- "Add eggs next; mix lightly until combined. Stir in half flour slowly till dough barely clings to hook, draping a bit."
- "Stream in melted coconut oil; then add remaining flour by handfuls. Knead 4-6 minutes watching dough become stretchy, soft, just tacky but not sticky. Adjust flour slightly if too wet—better slightly sticky than stiff."
- "Shape into smooth ball coated with cooking spray inside bowl, then turn dough to coat all sides. Cover with damp cloth, let rise 35-40 minutes until doubled and jiggly."
- "Meanwhile, gently warm butter, sugar, corn syrup in pan. Toss in cranberries, orange zest, and juice. Stir as cranberries burst, syrup thickens slightly—removes raw sugar grit. Off heat."
- "Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, salt in small bowl, setting aside for later sugar pull."
- "Lightly grease a 9×13 pan. Pour cranberry-orange topping into bottom, tip pan to spread evenly but avoid pushing fruit to edges."
- "Flour surface lightly. Turn dough out, roll gently to 14×22 inches. Brush with 4 tbsp melted butter, sprinkle evenly with cinnamon sugar mix. Too heavy and buns get overly sweet or soggy inside."
- "Roll dough tightly starting from narrow edge into long log. Use sharp serrated knife. Cut into 12 equal slices about 1 3/4 inch thick. Arrange slices cut side down, close on cranberry layer in pan."
- "Cover with cloth, rest another 25-30 minutes till puffy, not overproofed. Look for pillowy domes formed but no large bubbles."
- "Preheat oven to 375°F. Bake buns 27-30 minutes. Check edges—should be golden brown, bubbling juices visible at base. Top might brown faster—tent with foil loosely to avoid burnt edges."
- "Cool in pan 5 minutes. Set platter slightly larger over pan. Holding both, invert quickly but carefully—sticky fruit will want to cling inside pan. Gently coax any residual topping back onto buns with offset spatula."
- "Serve warm. Leftovers reheat well under foil in low oven to restore stickiness. Frozen dough slices thaw and rise longer for next batch."
introduction: "Scalding milk. Yeast awakens with a quiet fizz, smelling just right, foaming like a small cloud in the bowl. Nothing worse than dead yeast—learned the hard way. Eggs slip in smooth, binding the soft dough. Flour measured by feel not cups; adding a dusting prevents leathery rolls. Coconut oil swapped in for shortening for a nutty twist, melds with cranberries poppin’ their tart hearts out in warm sticky syrup. Orange zest sneaks brightness, tips the sweet-sour equation just so. Rolling thin makes those layers worth it; thick dough suffocates the sugar. Cutting with a serrated knife keeps sharp edges, no squashing. Flipped while warm, the sticky topping glistens underneath, the final reveal worth every sticky finger. Not foolproof but always worth the chaos."
ingredientsNote: "Milk heat matters—too hot kills the yeast, too cold keeps it dormant. Look for steam rising but no bubbles. Yeast won’t bubble up if it's old or water too cold—always proof it. Coconut oil is a smoother melt than butter or shortening but melted butter works fine if you’re loyal. Corn syrup can swap honey or light molasses in a pinch; syrup keeps sticky texture without overpowering sweetness. Fresh cranberries preferred but frozen work if you defrost and drain excess liquid. Orange zest and juice impact brightness—choose ripe, fragrant fruit. Cinnamon sugar is simple but crucial, provides that baked crisp edge layering flavor and crunch to the rolls. Salt balances everything, never skip it. Use cooking spray liberally so the sticky fruit doesn’t glue your pan forever."
instructionsNote: "Scalding milk: watch the surface—bubbles forming is too hot. Proof yeast in microwarmed milk to gauge freshness; it bubbles within 10 minutes. Knead to a tacky, elastic dough—too dry and the rolls will be tough, too wet and crumbly. Cover dough with damp towel or plastic wrap sprayed with oil to prevent drying during rising. Let dough double—not triple, or sugar melts unevenly later. Cranberry topping must simmer gently; cranberries should burst but not pulverize or cook down to jam. Roll on lightly floured surface—too much flour means heavy, dense buns. Rolling tight keeps rolls intact, cutting with serrated knife prevents dough slippage. Second rise critical—look for pillowy lifts, not fermented smell. Bake until tops are golden but juices bubble up—sign of perfect sticky texture inside. Tent foil early if color races ahead. Flip while warm for neat presentation, use spatula to reclaim sticky bits. Serve hot or warm—cold sticky buns lose their charm. Store leftovers loosely covered; reheat gently to revive stickiness."
tips:
- "Scald milk carefully—watch for steam rising, don't let bubbles form or yeast dies off. Microwave or stovetop works but timing varies wildly. Yeast likes warmth but not hot kill-zone. Proof by resting with sugar and salt swirled before milk hits; foaming yeast smells sweet, piquant. Skip if old or smells off."
- "Flour use measured by feel, not cups. Start lower; dough sticky but elastic is key. Kneading 4-6 minutes builds strength, stretch dough to windowpane stage if unsure. Add flour gradually after oil blends in. Too stiff dough = heavy rolls. Too wet and sticky but better to err on tacky side than dry crumbly."
- "Butter-sugar syrup heating needs patience. Low heat coax sugar grit out, cranberries burst teasingly instead of disintegrate. Orange zest and juice folded in last to keep brightness strong but balanced. Corn syrup can swap honey or molasses for sticky texture; adjust sweetness downward if needed."
- "Rolling dough thinner than expected makes layers and rise better. Too thick and buns stew inside, not rise fully. Brush melted butter sparingly under cinnamon sugar layer or chewiness develops. Serrated knife keeps edges distinct, less squishing than straight blade. Cut near even slices for even baking and topping reveal."
- "Second rise controlled—puffy but not bubble blown. Cloth cover damp prevents skin dry out. Lay buns close but don't overcrowd or fruit layer seeps. Oven hot at 375F; edges color fast but tent with foil stops burnt spots. Flip buns warm with spatula help; sticky fruit clings, careful or fruit layer tears. Reheat wrapped foil low temp keeps stickiness alive."
faq:
- "q: Why scald milk first? a: Kills bad enzymes, warms liquid enough to activate yeast. Not boiling. Steam just rising means sweet spot. Too cool no foam, too hot kills yeast instantly. It’s balance. Watch close, test timing by eye not clock."
- "q: Can I use butter instead of coconut oil? a: Yes but texture differs. Coconut oil melts smoother, blends better at dough stage. Butter adds flavor but may need temp adjustment or tighten flour a bit. Shortening works too but coconut oil gives subtle nuttiness not present with butter."
- "q: What if rolls don’t rise well? a: Check yeast freshness first. Old yeast no foam. Temperature matters—too cold retards rise. Overkneading toughens dough, underkneading weakens structure. Cover with damp cloth, avoid drafts. Temperature and proof timing critical to get pillowy buns not dense lumps."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Wrapped loosely in foil or airtight container fridge. Reheat low temp wrapped in foil to bring back sticky glaze. Frozen dough slice can thaw and rise longer before baking. Keeps texture but might lose some shine if reheated fast or uncovered."
