ingredients:
- "1 cedar plank soaked 1-2 hours"
- "1 1/2 pounds salmon filet skin-on"
- "Spicy Salmon Sauce:"
- "1/3 cup mayonnaise"
- "1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper"
- "1 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning"
- "1 teaspoon hot sauce (like Frank's RedHot)"
- "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar"
- "Salmon Rub:"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt"
- "3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper"
- "3/4 teaspoon white pepper"
- "3 lemon slices"
instructions:
- "Start by soaking cedar plank in water minimum an hour, up to two. Keeps wood smoking not burning — tickles salmon with smoke."
- "Mix together spicy sauce. Mayo base, cayenne, Old Bay, hot sauce, sugar. Sugar sneaks in caramel notes, helps that caramelized crust."
- "Rub dry spices over salmon skin side in, lay thick. Don’t skip resting fish with rub while warming grill. Salt draws flavors in, firmer texture."
- "Heat grill to medium-high — think 375°F to 400°F. Not blazing, but hot enough to sizzle cedar and sear fish."
- "Place salmon on cedar plank, skin side down. Set plank directly over heat. You’ll hear popping wood, smell rising smoky-sweet cedar."
- "Close lid tight, watch smoke start curling. Five minutes first. Then open, slather on spicy sauce. Listen: fish should sizzle now."
- "Shut lid, cook three more. Smells deepen, surface flakes starting to firm up."
- "Slather again thickly, sauce thickens on top. Close for two more minutes. Slather seal builds a sticky, fiery glaze."
- "Open again, scatter lemon slices on top. Close for another two minutes. Lemon aroma bursts, juice steams into fish."
- "Check doneness by flaking with fork to peek. Flesh should be firm but still moist. Internal temp about 150°F; hotter dries out salmon."
- "Lift plank straight off grill, serve immediately – skin crisps, sauce sticky, cedar infuses subtle smoke."
- "If no cedar plank, soaked thick wood board or foil boat with wood chips underneath works okay. Avoid soaking less than 45 minutes, otherwise catch fire."
- "Leftover spicy sauce = dip or spread next day. Bonus flavor rescue."
- "If grill too hot, plank chars fast, fish cooks unevenly. Adjust coals or burners down, keep cedar smoking slow."
introduction: "Nothing like that slap of smoky cedar on salmon to wake up the senses. I’ve burned my share of planks, fish cooked undercooked and dry. Took learning to hold heat steady, watch those smoke curls, tuning timing by sight and smell, not just minutes. This ain’t a fast food deal. It’s fiery spice mixed with that sweet sugar caramelizing on top, intense heat from cayenne that wakes the flesh up. The mayo sauce? Thick coat that locks the spice in place without burning. Lemon at the end breaks fat, adds brightness. The cedar whispers to the fish rather than shouts. Watch the sizzling wood, smell the spices caramelizing, poke the flesh for the perfect soft flake. You’ll get a smoky, spicy dinner with crisp skin and tender pink flesh not overcooked, no wet fish smell, just charred edges and citrus steam. Cedar planks aren’t obligatory but they lift this from good to something else – smoky, aromatic, tactile – a grilling moment long to remember."
ingredientsNote: "Cedar plank needs soaking for smoke, minimum 60 minutes but up to two hours is safer. Too dry and it’ll flare, one slip charred my fingers once. Spices can be tweaked: cayenne is fire but swap half for smoked paprika if you want warmth without heat. Old Bay is classic, but if unavailable, use a combo of celery salt and paprika. Dark brown sugar, not light, for that molasses depth—sub with maple syrup or honey but reduce other liquids slightly. Mayonnaise thick sufficiency, but if allergic swap for Greek yogurt or silken tofu for tang and body. Salmon filet skin-on keeps it intact on plank, replace with steelhead trout in pinch for similar texture. Lemon slices added right at end so they don’t burn, drop fresh squeeze if missed. Kosher salt best for rub, but fine sea salt works if careful not to oversalt. The rub’s purpose—flavor build and drawing moisture to skin to crisp up nicely. Preparing all mixes ahead saves stress at grill."
instructionsNote: "Structure steps around fire behavior and sensory cues, not strict times. Soak cedar plank enough or it’ll ignite. Place plank on grill first few minutes to test smoking rhythm. When salmon hits board, listen for crackle of wood meeting flame, smell cedar rising—not bitter burnt wood but aromatic smoke. Rub on spices lets fish dry out slightly securing the crust instead of steaming in its skin; don’t skip resting rub on fish while grill heats. Basting with spicy sauce 3 times builds layers—first thin to season, second thick to caramelize, third seals flavors and prevents drying. Lemon slices at last bring brightness, fracturing the fat layers. Watch salmon flake with gentle poke, if fish resists flaking, keep closed a minute or two longer, better to rely on texture and color than thermometer alone. Overcooking dries fish, undercooking raw flavors dominate. Use foil under plank if flare-ups occur and keep grill vented to modulate heat. Leftover sauce is secret weapon—spread on sandwiches or as dip for grilled veggies. Keep glaze thick not runny to avoid flare risk. Efficiency trick: prep sauces and rub in advance, soak cedar and have grill ready so fish hits heat just right."
tips:
- "Soak cedar plank at least 1 hour. Too dry? Flames spike, charred mess. Keep cool water soak, swap plank mid-grill if smoking fades. If no plank, foil boat with soaked chips good. Watch for quick sizzle sounds on wood for tip-in fire, not burn."
- "Rub spices on salmon skin side, pat down firm. Rest fish 10 minutes while grill heats. Salt draws moisture outward. That texture crunch builds early. Skip resting rub, fish stays soft, no crust. Keep rub dry, no liquid in mix or it won’t adhere well."
- "Grill temp steady medium-high; 375°F-400°F range. Too hot, plank chars fast, fish cooks uneven. Too cool, no sizzle, longer cook. Smell cedar smoke rise, not sharp burnt wood. Listen for initial stable crackle on plank, that’s when fish hits."
- "Baste spicy sauce 3x during cook. First thin layer seasons; second thickens, caramelizing sugar; third seals flavor and locks moisture. Sauce thick, not runny, avoids flare-ups. Apply quickly between lid closes, glaze builds sticky, spicy crust."
- "Add lemon slices last few minutes. Avoid too early or lemons burn, bitter. Drops steam citrus through fish pores just right. If forgot, squeeze fresh lemon at table after serving. Skin crisps near plank edge; lift plank straight off grill to keep crispness intact."
faq:
- "q: How long to soak cedar plank? a: At least 1 hour okay. Two hours better if time. Less than 45 minutes risks flare-ups, wood spits fire. If soaked too long, wood looses strength but smoke steady. Water temp doesn’t matter much, cold or room fine."
- "q: What if no cedar plank? a: Use thick hardwood board soaked well, or foil boat loaded with soaked wood chips. Chips pop and smoke fast, watch flames. Grill smoke indirect works too, but won’t get exact plank aroma or skin texture. Adjust times down slightly."
- "q: Why dry spices on skin? a: Moist rub won’t hold, fish steams under spice. Dry rub draws moisture, firms skin up, helps crisp later. Resting rub while grill heats lets salt pull out moisture, intensifying flavor and texture. Skipping rest means dull rub, weaker crust."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Sauce keeps up to 3 days refrigerate, seal container. Salmon last 2 days if wrapped tight. Reheat gently, avoid microwave timber too dry. Use leftover sauce as dip, spread, or marinade for veggies. Don’t refreeze salmon once cooked."
