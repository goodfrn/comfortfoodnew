ingredients:
- "1 7-ounce can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce"
- "3 tablespoons fresh lime juice"
- "1 cup mayonnaise (use Greek yogurt for lighter)"
- "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional)"
- "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "Add twist: 1 teaspoon smoked paprika for extra smoky depth"
instructions:
- "Start with chipotle peppers and some adobo sauce. Throw into a small food processor or blender. Blitz about 35 seconds. Want thick and chunky paste; don’t blitz smooth or lose character. Stop when you see big flakes of pepper skin but mixture holds together."
- "Spoon chipotle mash into a bowl. Set aside."
- "Without washing the processor, add lime juice, mayonnaise, cilantro if using, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika. Pulse briefly just to mix. Don’t overblend or mayo will get runny."
- "Add chipotle paste slowly — about a tablespoon at a time. Taste as you go. I toss the whole can in since I crave heat, but novices should add sparingly. Chipotle is smoky and fire-hot. Adjust to preference. Texture should be creamy with tiny chunks of chipotle pepper bits and specks of adobo."
- "Refrigerate remoulade at least 35 minutes. Rest time lets flavors marry and spices mellow. Sauce thickens up and spreads easier. Perfect for sandwiches or dipping."
- "Store airtight in fridge up to seven days. If it separates slightly, stir before serving. Will keep good flavor and texture."
- "If no chipotle on hand, substitute 1 tablespoon smoked paprika and 1 teaspoon cayenne. Not quite the same but hits smoky + heat notes."
- "Don’t skip rest steps. Fresh lime juice should buzz through but mellow, mayo smooths fiery chipotle bites, cilantro brightens or leaves optional. Salt brings balance. Without them, sauce clangs flat."
- "Efficiency tip: use leftover adobo sauce from can in small amounts for punchy flavor. Just add teaspoon by teaspoon in step 3."
- "Common mistake: blitzing chipotle peppers too long—results in unappealing watery sauce. Aim for thick paste; texture matters for mouthfeel."
- "If sauce seems too thick after chilling, stir in a teaspoon or two water or lime juice to loosen for dipping."
- "Sounds odd, but small bits of chipotle pepper skin give bursts of smoky flavor and visible interest in sauce."
- "My kitchen smells like fire and citrus after this one. The tap of lime juice cuts through the richness, prevents mayo from overwhelming the senses."
- "Don’t rush the blending. Too quick and it’s chunky; too long and gravy. Perfect is that little gritty, thick smear you can spread and still see flecks of pepper skin."
- "Leftover remoulade on roasted cauliflower or grilled tofu? Game changer. Keeps texture, flavor alive even days later."
- "This sauce wakes up under a grill’s smoky scent. Same chipotle but deeper, more alive. Best when you taste and adjust, never guess."
- "Skip cilantro if you dislike soapiness or add parsley for different herb note."
- "I tried sour cream swap once, but mayo offers better creaminess and richness—the base matters."
introduction: "Smoky. Spicy. A bit tangy from lime. This remoulade hits hard with chipotle heat but lets mayo mellow the storm. I’ve mixed this up countless times, sometimes skipping cilantro when out or tossing in smoked paprika for deeper smokiness. It’s about balance—getting chunkier texture than pure smooth sauces. Don’t blitz peppers too much or it turns into watery trouble. The kitchen fills with a smoky fire aroma that’s almost addictive. This sauce clings well; great on sandwiches or as dipping sauce. Play with the heat, add chipotle slow. The lime gives a zing that cuts through the richness. Store it chilled and watch flavors deepen. Tried yogurt once but mayo wins for creaminess. The texture of this sauce is key, seeing little bits of peppers gives every bite character."
ingredientsNote: "Can’t find chipotle peppers in adobo? Use 1 tablespoon smoked paprika plus a pinch of cayenne instead, add gradually to taste. Mayo is base but Greek yogurt swaps well for less fat but changes texture—thinner, less rich. Fresh lime juice must be fresh, bottled juice kills brightness and aroma. Cilantro optional depending on your taste; parsley or chives offer alternatives but cilantro keeps that Mexican-inspired character. Sea salt is more subtle than table salt; no iodized taste. Black pepper freshly ground is best to bring spice and warmth. Smoked paprika (my addition) adds a layer of smoky sweet richness if you want to deepen heat without extra chili. Keep everything chilled after mixing; heat intensifies in warm sauces. Mixing leftover adobo sauce from can brings complexity but can add saltiness, so add gradually and taste. Always adjust: chipotle peppers differ in heat batch to batch so cautious is smarter than drenching."
instructionsNote: "Start by pureeing chipotles just enough to get thick paste, not liquid. Texture is everything—chips and flakes in sauce feel alive, don’t aim for smooth. Transfer before mixing with other ingredients to control how much sauce goes in. Then add lime juice, mayo, cilantro, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika (optional) all at once without washing processor for efficiency—pulse briefly; don’t overblend or mayo thins out. Add chipotle paste gradually, tasting after each stir. Heat builds fast with chipotle; too much ruins balance. Let sauce chill at least 30 minutes before using; flavors marry and thicken making it easier to spread or dip. If sauce separates in fridge, stir before serving. Can keep for about a week refrigerated tightly sealed. If too thick after chilling, loosen with a teaspoon of lime juice or water. Don’t rush; kitchen smells smoky and tangy when done, visual cues include sauce thickened, flecks visible, thick enough to spread but not runny. Leaving mixture to rest intensifies flavor without adding anything. This sauce is about balance between heat, acidity, creaminess, and texture. A quick test is smearing on finger—you want texture, smoky spicy linger, not smooth mush."
tips:
- "Pulse chipotle peppers short bursts. Too long and sauce turns watery, loses chunky texture. Look for thick paste with visible skins; bits add smokiness and mouthfeel, don’t puree smooth."
- "Add lime juice, mayo, cilantro all at once after chipotle paste. Pulse just enough to mix; overblending thins mayo. Mayonnaise keeps sauce creamy, brightness from lime stops heaviness, cilantro optional for fresh punch."
- "Add chipotle slowly while stirring, taste often. Heat varies batch to batch; better cautious than scorched palate. Start with tablespoon amounts; adjust for smoky fire balance. Paprika layers smokiness without heat spike."
- "Rest remoulade chilled 30+ minutes. Flavors marry, sauce thickens, easier to spread. If sauce seems too thick after fridge, loosen with teaspoon lime juice or water, stir gently to keep texture intact."
- "If no chipotle on hand, use 1 tablespoon smoked paprika plus pinch cayenne. Not same punch but smoky and heat notes mid-range. Greek yogurt swaps mayo for lighter texture but sauce thins out; fresh lime juice mandatory for brightness."
faq:
- "q: Can I skip cilantro? a: Yes. Some find it soapy or overpowering. Use parsley or chives for herb complexity instead. Leaves sauce without green bits if disliked. Optional always."
- "q: How to fix watery sauce? a: Cause is over-blending chipotle peppers. Stop puree early. Thicken with more mayo or chill longer. Stirring in too much liquid also culprit. Add liquids slowly to avoid runny."
- "q: What if chipotle peppers vary in heat? a: Start small, taste frequently. Heat fluctuates per batch. Add more only if needed. Use non-spicy smoky paprika for mild version or reduce chipotle quantity."
- "q: How long to store remoulade? a: Up to seven days airtight refrigerated. Stir if separates. Freshness best first 3-4 days. Keep chilled always. Can also freeze but texture may change slightly."
