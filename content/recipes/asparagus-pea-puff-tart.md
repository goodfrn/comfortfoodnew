ingredients:
- "140 grams store-bought puff pastry sheet, thawed and cold"
- "75 milliliters creamy dairy-free herb spread (e.g. almond-based Boursin style), plus extra for serving"
- "320 grams thin asparagus spears, trimmed"
- "1/2 small shallot, thinly sliced"
- "10 milliliters white wine vinegar"
- "50 grams frozen peas, blanched 45 seconds and drained"
- "15 grams mixed fresh herbs (parsley and rosemary leaves)"
- "20 milliliters toasted sliced almonds, chopped"
- "Juice and fine zest of one small lemon"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 195 °C (385 °F). Line baking tray with parchment paper."
- "Dust surface lightly with flour. Roll out puff pastry into approximately 22 cm square. Transfer to baking tray."
- "Spread creamy herb blend evenly over dough, leaving smallest margin at edges."
- "Arrange asparagus on top, slightly overlapping. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Bake 28 to 33 minutes until edges puffed and golden brown."
- "Meanwhile, combine shallots and vinegar in bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Let sit 12 minutes, then drain."
- "Remove tart from oven. Scatter peas over surface. Top with shallots, herbs, almonds, lemon zest, and a squeeze of lemon juice."
- "Cut tart into 6 wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature, with extra herb spread dolloped on each wedge."
introduction: "Flaky. Buttery layers. Crunch beneath a bright heap of fresh veg. Asparagus with a tangy tooth pickled shallot slices sneak in under the lemon hit and toasted almonds. Peas burst in short heat. Creaminess from herbed spread, yet fully plant-based. Quick prep, no fuss. The roll-out could be square, more rustic than perfect circle. Balsamic vinegar, less dense, more notes but stays light. Rosemary stands in for dill's soft woodiness. Pieces to share, warm or cooled, simplicity in a bite. Seasonal celebration, take it as a starter or light meal."
ingredientsNote: "Puff pastry needs to be thawed completely but kept cold for easier rolling and flaking results. Opt for almond or cashew-based dairy-free herb spreads for creaminess that doesn’t weigh down the tart. Vinegar swap: white wine vinegar transforms acidity without overpowering, unlike stronger balsamic. Fresh herbs like parsley and rosemary bring a layered complexity; avoid wet herbs that release too much moisture during baking. Blanch peas briefly to keep them bright and tender but not mushy. Toast almonds whole and chop for texture contrast. Lemon zest and juice add freshness post-bake, crucial after baking tamps down flavors."
instructionsNote: "Flour the surface sparingly to prevent dough sticking but do not overload—puff sheets can toughen with excess flour. Rolling to around 22 cm square balances edge puffing and topping coverage. Spread the herb blend thinly to avoid sogginess but enough to create flavor foundation. Overlap asparagus slightly to create a mosaic pattern and hold them secured on the dough. Seasoning asparagus before baking draws out moisture and enhances taste. Bake until dough is visibly puffed and golden at edges; check between 28 and 33 minutes, adjusting for oven variances. Prepare shallots early—maceration in vinegar softens bite and adds acidity. Drain shallots thoroughly to avoid waterlogging tart surface. Scatter peas and toppings immediately after baking; heat softens peas gently without dulling color. Final touch of lemon zest and juice brightens and ties overall flavor, serves as an acidic lift. Let tart rest 5 minutes before slicing to set structure but serve warm for ideal mouthfeel."
tips:
- "Use cold puff pastry for best results. Thaw, keep it cold while rolling. Rolling to about 22 cm square. Helps with puffing. Dry surface with flour, not too much. Just lightly dust. Chill before baking."
- "Herb spread should be thin but flavorful. Avoid sogginess. Use dairy-free alternatives like almond-based. Fresh herbs enhance flavor complexity. Mix parsley and rosemary for a woodsy note. Don't use wet herbs during baking."
- "Blanch peas briefly to keep their bright green color. Do it for exactly 45 seconds. Drain well after. Adds brightness to the tart. Timing matters here. Too long ruins texture."
- "Macerate shallots in vinegar for at least 12 minutes. It softens their bite. Adds needed acidity to balance. Drain well, moisture ruins base. Scatter toppings right after baking."
- "Final touches count. Zest lemon over warmth. Adds freshness and vibrancy. Squeeze juice too. Elevates flavor profile. Serve warm, but can also enjoy at room temp."
