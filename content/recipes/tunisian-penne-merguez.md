ingredients:
- "400 g (14 oz) gluten-free penne or similar short pasta"
- "1 large red onion, thinly sliced"
- "3 tbsp olive oil"
- "300 g (10 oz) merguez sausages, sliced diagonally 2 cm (¾ in) thick"
- "2 tbsp harissa paste"
- "200 ml (¾ cup) chicken stock or vegetable broth"
- "100 g (¾ cup) roasted red peppers, chopped"
- "3 tbsp fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped"
- "1 preserved lemon peel, finely diced"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Drop pasta and stir often. Cook until al dente, typically 9 to 11 minutes, but start tasting at 8. Avoid mush; you want bite, slight resistance. Drain, toss with a drizzle of olive oil to stop sticking; set aside."
- "Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. When shimmering, add sliced onions. Stir occasionally, soften, edges turning translucent and sweetly aromatic, about 5-7 minutes. Avoid browning here; want gentle sweetness."
- "Add sliced merguez. Let sizzle without moving too much, browning those edges, releasing spicy fats and aroma. About 6 minutes until sausages snap with browned bits. Don’t rush; twice flipping works better than constant poking."
- "Lower heat briefly, stir in harissa paste and roasted red peppers. Cook 2 minutes to awaken the flavors, smells deepen, peppers soften but retain texture."
- "Pour in stock; scrape browned bits stuck on pan bottom—this is flavor gold. Bring to gentle simmer. Let reduce slightly and thicken for about 10 minutes, sauce coats back of spoon. Taste for seasoning: add salt sparingly, pepper boldly."
- "Toss cooked penne directly into skillet, fold carefully but thoroughly to coat each pasta with luscious sauce. Heat through just a few minutes; do not overcook pasta now, no gluey mess."
- "Remove from heat; sprinkle chopped cilantro and preserved lemon peel on top. The lemon adds unexpected brightness—no substitutes better than the preserved stuff here, but regular lemon zest can work if finely grated and added last minute."
- "Serve immediately. Leftovers reheat well with splash of water or broth to loosen sauce."
introduction: "Spice hits before the pasta does. Merguez and harissa punch through with no apologies. Roasted peppers mellow the heat—a dance in every bite. I’ve tried this with regular penne, whole wheat, even chickpea pasta; all good, but gluten-free penne stands up best here, texture’s spot-on and no soggy regrets. Onions caramelize into sweet whispers beneath the bold sausage. Preserved lemon peel? Game changer. Adds a funky brightness I missed on first attempts—I thought lemon zest would do, but nah. It lacked guts. The stock’s reduction thickens sauce–watch it, don’t rush or you dry the pan out. Different cooks swear by fresh parsley. I prefer cilantro; it sings better with African spices and makes leftovers sing too."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping regular penne for gluten-free changes texture, so adjust boiling time and taste frequently—some brands overcook easily. Merguez sausages with high fat content need care to avoid toughening; don’t overcrowd the pan and give them room to brown. Harissa varies wildly—start small if your taste buds aren’t used to fiery heat. Roasted red peppers can come from a jar; fresh-roasted is better but patience demanded. Preserved lemon is rare but pivotal—if unavailable, add a squeeze of fresh lemon at plating, but the character shifts. Cilantro substitute? Parsley or even mint, depending on mood, but it shifts flavor profile entirely. Use homemade or good-quality stock; water dilutes the punch and flattens the bowl."
instructionsNote: "Boiling pasta always requires active tasting after 7 minutes, visual cues lie—pasta swelling but still firm, no mushy bellies. Onions softening till edges turn translucent but no brown spots; this sweetness balances spicy sausages, so don’t skip or burn. Browning merguez in batches yields better crust and less steaming. Harissa and peppers added once fat rendered helps coating—oil carries flavor, so don't rush. Simmer stock gently to concentrate but keep moisture—a spoon should cling to it without drying the pan. Toss pasta off heat to prevent overcooking or glue formation. Finish with fresh herbs off-heat for aromatic burst. Adjust seasoning at every stage; flavors evolve. Use preserved lemon carefully—too much overwhelms. Reheating? Moisture and gentle heat revive softness and flavor."
tips:
- "Boil gluten-free penne with frequent tasting starting at 7-8 minutes. Texture varies by brand. Slight bite needed. Overcook leads to mush. Toss pasta with olive oil immediately after draining to avoid sticking; don't skip especially for gluten-free."
- "Slice merguez 2 cm thick diagonally. Browning edges key, so don’t crowd pan; sausages release fat. Halfway flip twice instead of poking often—keeps texture intact, crisp bits form. Low heat after searing to avoid toughness but allow flavor release."
- "Harissa paste strength swings wildly. Add small amounts first; stir into softened onions and peppers for mellow release. Roasted red peppers add sweetness and texture contrast—jarred or fresh-roasted works, but fresh means longer cooking patience."
- "Stock reduction crucial—scrape pan bottom carefully to lift browned bits, these add deep flavor. Simmer gently for about 10 minutes, watch moisture closely; sauce should coat back of spoon, not dry or watery. Adjust salt and pepper gradually; pepper bolder than salt."
- "Preserved lemon peel adds funky citrus brightness, can overpower if dumped in. Use finely diced, fold in at end with cilantro off heat. Substitute regular lemon zest sparingly at plating stage if unavailable; note flavor shifts. Cilantro fresh chopped works best; parsley or mint alter profile."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid mushy gluten-free pasta? a: Taste during boil from 7 minutes. Different brands vary a lot. Draining right after al dente crucial. Toss with oil. Don’t trust timers blindly."
- "q: What if no preserved lemon? a: Use fresh lemon zest at plating just before serving. Not same punch but workable. Adds brightness without funk. Or skip and increase cilantro for fresh herbal lift. Avoid overdoing citrus early in cooking."
- "q: Merguez sausages too tough after cooking? a: Might be pan crowding or too high heat. Cook in batches if needed. Flip twice only so crust forms but fat stays rendered. Lower heat after searing. Rest briefly after cooking before folding into sauce."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Fridge best in airtight. Reheat with splash water or stock to loosen sauce. Microwave or stove okay but gentle heat. Avoid drying out. Freezing possible but sauce thickens; add liquid when reheating for texture."
