slug: "stuffed-mozzarella-meatloaf"
description: "A hearty meatloaf bulking up with mozzarella hiding in the center. Tossed onions, garlic, and Parmesan bind the crumbly beef and pork. Ketchup blended with peach preserves replaces the typical tangy glaze. Press the meat mixture firmly around the cheese mound, crucial to avoid melting cheese escapes. Oven routine split into phases. Watch melting cheese, browning crust, firm internal feel. Rest before slicing or it’ll fall apart. Simple substitutions available if pantry gaps hit. Solid for weeknight dinners or weekend experiments."

ingredients:
- "1 cup finely chopped onion"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 1/2 cups seasoned breadcrumbs"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese"
- "1/4 cup milk"
- "1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1/2 lb ground beef"
- "1/2 lb ground pork"
- "6 oz shredded mozzarella cheese"
- "1/3 cup ketchup"
- "1/3 cup peach preserves"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 340°F. Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray or coat with lard if you want extra flavor ; parchment paper lining recommended for easy lift out."
- "In a large bowl, mix onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, eggs, Parmesan, milk, Worcestershire, salt. The mix smells earthy and sharp from Parmesan; coats fingers sticky but not wet."
- "Add ground beef and pork. Break apart into small clumps; hands do best job. Toss gently, keep some crumb bits visible. Overmixing can toughen the loaf; patience matters here."
- "Press half the meat mixture into pan base and sides, about 1 inch high. In the center mound the shredded mozzarella - more than 6 oz can ooze out so moderate. Cover with remaining meat, packing firmly but not squashing air out or it’ll get dense."
- "Slide into oven uncovered for 35 minutes. The top firms, edges brown slightly. Cheese inside begins to bubble, audible pop of melting."
- "While loaf bakes, stir ketchup with peach preserves on medium heat until smooth, shiny, slightly reduced around edges by 5 minutes. Sweetness tames acidity, adds unexpected warmth."
- "Remove loaf; pour glaze evenly over top. Return to oven uncovered for another 25 minutes or until internal temperature hits 160°F. Look for golden crust, juices lightly pooling at sides."
- "Rest meatloaf 7-10 minutes. This lets juices redistribute else slicing turns into disaster. Use parchment sling or spatula to lift carefully, slice against grain in thick slabs."
- "If cheese leaks, no foul; scoop with bread or serve alongside mustard aioli. Loaf keeps well wrapped in fridge then reheated gently on stovetop or oven."
introduction: "Meatloaf. Classic, yet often overcooked, dry, uninspiring. Learned to ditch too much breadcrumb filler, to coax moisture with milk and eggs balanced by sharp Parmesan. Tried ground pork blended in to add richness and fat without greasy heaviness. Found mozzarella hidden center gives blast of molten cheesy bliss during the cut. Grape jelly swapped out for peach preserves, something from a dusty jar found on a whim. Adds fruity undertone not expected but welcomed. Oven temp lowered slightly; 340°F keeps crust from getting too crispy while cheese melts nicely inside. Resting is mandatory to avoid drippy slices. I never skip pan lining; makes pulling loaf out simple, keeps edges intact. Hands on mixing, firm but gentle packing, interrupted baking steps. Trust your nose, touch, sight over timers alone."
ingredientsNote: "Breadcrumbs: Seasoned variety adds herbs and flavor without additional work. If unavailable, use plain breadcrumbs with dash of herb mix. Eggs stabilize meat and aid moisture; fresh ones critical for binding. Parmesan cheese is not optional; it layers nutty saltiness, can sub Pecorino Romano for sharper bite. Milk softens texture, choose whole for creaminess or plant-based for a dairy-free twist. Worcestershire adds umami depth; soy sauce can substitute but reduce salt elsewhere. Ground beef alone can dry out, blending half with ground pork helps keep it tender, pork shoulder preferred for fat content. Mozzarella type matters; go for low-moisture shredded, avoid fresh balls or cheese will weep and flood pan. Glaze switch from grape jelly to peach preserves smoothes sweet finish, apricot jam also works. Pan choice: loaf pan lined with parchment or greased meatloaf pan. Lard or butter over spray enrich crust flavor."
instructionsNote: "Preheating oven ensures even cooking temperature; 340°F slightly lower than usual to avoid dry, cracked crusts. Parchment lining solves tight loaf sticks problem while allowing easy lift-out. Combine ingredients in stages to layer flavors and avoid overmixing, too much breaks meat fibers leading to dense loaf. Pressing half meat mixture up sides creates shell around cheese; prevents melted mozzarella from escaping during bake. Rest period crucial; hot resting lets juices redistribute rather than run out like a river during slicing. Glaze: stir ketchup and peach preserves over medium heat until well combined and just reduced; too thick and it burns on top, too thin and it runs off. Watch loaf surface for firmness before adding sheen glaze, bubbling cheese inside audible sign of nearing done. Always use meat thermometer for final temp; tossing a slice in oven too long means dry loaf. Slice thickly, serve warm to keep cheese gooey and crust crisp. Freeze well wrapped for make ahead meals."
tips:
- "Press half meat mixture firmly into pan sides and base - creates thick shell around mozzarella. Cheese melts violently if escape paths exist. Avoid dense loaf by not squashing air. Hands best for gentle but firm packing."
- "Use low-moisture shredded mozzarella for less weeping; fresh ball cheeses flood pan with water. Amount matters too. 6 ounces max — more makes gooey escape inevitable. Keep eyeball on bubbling cheese sounds for doneness."
- "Glaze simmer time critical; too thick burns, too thin runs off and pools unevenly. Medium heat, stir until shiny and slightly reduced edges. Expect faint fruit aroma from peach preserves. Can swap apricot jam or grape jelly with less sweetness."
- "Oven temperature at 340°F feels low but keeps crust from cracking and drying; crust forms while cheese melts inside. Timing split into two phases; initial bake firms edges and sets shape; second glaze phase adds shine and seals moisture inside."
- "Rest loaf 7-10 minutes off heat after baking; juices redistribute or slice turns runny disaster. Use parchment sling or spatula to lift - loaf fragile before resting. Slicing against grain thickly maintains shape and chewy texture. Refrigerate leftovers tightly wrapped."
faq:
- "q: Can I use just ground beef? a: Sure but gets dry fast if no pork mixed. Pork adds fat and moisture. If using beef only, increase milk or egg slightly. Monitor closely, overcooked beef shrinks and toughens. Consider pork shoulder or fattier beef cuts for balance."
- "q: Fresh mozzarella instead of shredded? a: Not advised. Fresh water content too high, will leak messily and sog loaf base. Shredded low-moisture preferred for controlled melting. If fresh only, dry thoroughly and reduce amount. Expect watery pan and risk flattening loaf shape."
- "q: How to fix glaze burning? a: Reduce heat. Stir frequently. Check thickness early. Too thick blackens fast. Use timer. Swap peach preserves if high sugar jams burn easily. Lower oven rack position can help prevent scorching top surface too soon."
- "q: Storage tips? a: Wrap tight in foil or plastic wrap, fridge up to 4 days. Freeze slices well, thaw gently. Reheat low and slow in oven or stovetop to retain crust and melt cheese without drying. Microwave not ideal but works if urgent; expect soft crust then."
