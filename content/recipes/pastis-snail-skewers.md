ingredients:
- "1 small shallot finely chopped"
- "3 cloves garlic finely minced"
- "2 cans 80 g each snails, rinsed and drained"
- "25 ml butter"
- "50 ml Pernod"
- "100 ml dry white wine"
- "20 ml mayonnaise"
- "20 ml chopped fresh chives"
- "wooden skewers soaked 30 min"
instructions:
- "1 Heat butter in pan, gently soften shallot and garlic about 3 minutes. Add snails, salt and pepper."
- "2 Pour Pernod and white wine, boil, reduce nearly dry about 8 minutes. Transfer to bowl, cool slightly."
- "3 Stir in mayonnaise and chives, adjust seasoning."
- "4 Preheat grill to high, brush grate lightly with oil."
- "5 Thread 4-5 snails per skewer (use soaked wooden skewers)."
- "6 Grill each side 3 minutes to get char marks and warmth. Serve warm for starters or cocktail."
introduction: "Snails are more than a fancy plate. They bite-sized, quick to cook. That butter and herb meld, but with an anise twist that's less pastis, more fresh Pernod. Garlic and shallots soften the earthiness. Mayonnaise stays low, just to bind. Little grilled toothpicks carry the bites; easy to snack on. No nuts. No gluten. No dairy aside from butter. Toss in chives for a green pop instead of estragon. Turn the dial on spirits and grilling times, make it yours. Smoke and liquor mix under summer sun or in cozy kitchen heat. Skip long prep, start chopping, then grill quick and serve. It’s simple, rustic French vibes but no fuss. Snails, spirits, herbs, easy grill."
ingredientsNote: "Start with quality canned snails, rinsed well to remove brine. Swap pastis for Pernod to shift licorice notes sharper. Instead of estragon, fresh chives add a mild oniony brightness that plays differently with mayo and butter. Garlic and shallot must be finely minced to meld into the sauce smoothly. Cut the mayo down slightly to keep flavors balanced, not heavy. Butter quantity reduced slightly to lower fat and let the liquor and wine shine. Soak wooden skewers a good 30 minutes before grilling to avoid charring or burning. White wine should be dry, crisp to keep acidity bright in the reduction. These tweaks keep ingredients moderate, fresh, and accessible without losing punch."
instructionsNote: "Gentle sweating of shallot and garlic first builds base flavor without browning. Add snails at this stage so flavors mix. Pour alcohols slowly, letting liquids reduce down almost to dryness for intensity but preventing burning. Transferring off direct heat to cool before mayo keeps mayonnaise from splitting or cooking. Stir in fresh chives last to preserve color and aroma. Grill skewers at high heat quickly, char edges but keep inside warm, about 3 minutes per side. Skewers go on oiled grill grate to prevent sticking. Thread 4-5 snails per stick so bites stay manageable, no falling off. Timing changes from original to increase marinade infusion with reduced cooking duration on the grill. Serve immediately. Good as finger food. Monitoring seasoning is essential since liquids reduce; salt at the last stage if necessary. No long rest needed. Serve warm or room temperature."
tips:
- "Finely mince shallots and garlic; chunkier bits won't soften or blend well in butter sauce. Keep heat low when sweating, avoid color change or bitter flavor, gentle simmer only for few minutes to build base."
- "Soak wooden skewers at least 30 minutes; dry wood catches flame, burns fast on grill. Use plenty of water, pat dry before threading snails, prevents flare-ups and sticking later on."
- "After adding Pernod and white wine, boil liquid down to near dry but watch carefully to avoid burning. The reduction concentrates flavor, sharpens anise notes, balances with white wine acidity for brightness."
- "Mix mayo in after off heat to avoid splitting. Mayonnaise is delicate with heat; gradual cooling before folding keeps texture creamy, no curdling. Add herbs last, stir gently to keep fresh green color and aroma."
- "Grill skewers on oiled grate, high heat short time – about 3 minutes a side. Quick char forms smoky flavor seal with warmth inside. Don’t crowd grill, leave space for even heat and easy turning. Serve immediately."
faq:
- "q: Can I use fresh snails instead of canned? a: Fresh need longer prep. Cleaning, purging essential. Canned bypasses all that. Fresh snails cook differently too, longer time. Adjust seasoning since fresh have milder taste."
- "q: What if I don't have Pernod? a: Substitute with Pastis or any anise-flavored spirit. Variations will change intensity of licorice notes. Could skip liquor but lose key flavor element. Use high quality dry white wine to compensate somewhat."
- "q: How to avoid mayo splitting in sauce? a: Heat is enemy. Remove pan from stove before stirring mayo in. Cool down sauce slightly. Stir gently last to keep emulsified. If sauce separates, add a few drops lemon juice or chill to reset texture."
- "q: Can I prepare skewers ahead? a: Yes but grill just before serving. Skewers assembled and sauce combined can wait a few hours refrigerated. Don't grill early or snails get tough. Warm serving best. Reheat briefly if needed but avoid overcooking."
