ingredients:
- "===Marine==="
- "100 ml honey"
- "25 ml Dijon mustard grainy style"
- "20 ml apple cider vinegar"
- "Salt and cracked black pepper"
- "===Skewers==="
- "600 g boneless leg of lamb, cut into 30 cubes about 2 cm each"
- "2 Granny Smith apples, diced to roughly 24 pieces 2 cm cubes"
- "6 wooden skewers soaked for 20 minutes"
- "1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves finely chopped"
instructions:
- "===Marine==="
- "1. Combine honey, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and pepper in small saucepan. Heat medium, swirl constantly till thick and viscous. About 12 minutes. Should coat spoon like syrup. Remove from heat, leave to cool slightly."
- "2. Preheat grill or barbecue high heat. Get grates smoking hot, clean with wire brush if needed."
- "===Skewers==="
- "3. Alternate lamb cubes and apple pieces tightly on skewers. Avoid loose threading so fruit doesn’t fall apart. Season with salt and tons of cracked black pepper."
- "4. Place skewers on grill. Listen for hiss, pop. Cook each side roughly 2 to 3 minutes max, watch for honey caramel bubbling and dark grill marks forming. Don’t burn; edges will darken but not blacken. Use brush to glaze with marinade after flipping each side. Lamb should still hold pink in center, apples soften but keep firmness."
- "5. When done, remove to plate. Sprinkle thyme leaves for fresh herbal punch; aroma hits you immediately."
- "6. Serve alongside foil-wrapped potatoes roasted with garlic and rosemary or grilled seasonal veggies to cut richness."
introduction: "Get the sizzle going. Lamb chunks threaded on skewers with granny smith apples—too tart to just stay plain. Swapped balsamic for apple cider vinegar to brighten, honey swapped in place of sugar for natural sticky gloss, a touch softer and smooth. Mustard changed up to Dijon grainy texture—grittier hit, more punch. Thyme not rosemary this time, fresher herby, subtle but lifts lamb’s heft. Grilling is all about listening—snap and hiss. Watch caramel, it’s the carnival of colour and smells. No numbness by overly charred edges. Apples still snap in juicy contrast next to tender lamb chunks. Simple, sharp, rustic. Because some days you just want grilling magic, not fuss. Learned that from many burned hot mess attempts. Don’t freak if glaze bubbles too fast. Pull back heat, it loves patience as much as heat. Watch visual cues: edges shine, meat springs back. Raw cooking times lie. Touch, visual or smell always tell more."
ingredientsNote: "Honey’s sweetness replaces the original cassonade but adds a deeper caramel note during reduction. Use grainy Dijon instead of coarse mustard to keep some texture in glaze but change flavour profile. Swapped balsamic vinegar out for apple cider vinegar, brighter and less sweet, complementing tart apple choice. Granny Smith chosen over Cortland for crisp acidity. Thyme instead of rosemary cuts the earthiness, adding subtle brightness. Cube lamb small, 2 cm, cooks evenly. Apples diced similarly to keep grilling uniform. Wooden skewers must soak to prevent burning and ash taste. If wooden skewers unavailable, metal ones work—just skip soaking. Salt and pepper are vital—don’t under-season lamb directly or you’ll lose that surface charm while grilling. Marinate glaze reduces for about 12 minutes, less than original but thicker, concentrating honey. Bake potatoes in foil with garlic and thyme alongside for easy, no-fuss sides. If no grill available, broil in oven watching closely to mimic char."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating glaze ingredients slowly till thickens. Swirling often prevents burning honey’s sugar at bottom. Too thick and syrup won’t spread evenly; too thin and glazing slips off lamb. Preheat grill hot and clean—nothing kills sear like grime or lukewarm grate. Thread lamb and apple cubes firmly to avoid fruit slipping off. Season heavily before cooking. Grill about 2-3 minutes per side, flipping to char evenly on all surfaces. Listen for sizzling, smell sweet aroma thickening. Apply glaze after every flip; you need glossy, sticky molasses effect to gently coat lamb without flare-ups. Watch for sugars caramelizing but not charring black. When lamb bounces lightly under finger but still springy, not clinging to touch, near medium rare, pull off. Let sit briefly so juices redistribute. Sprinkle fresh thyme last minute; that burst of green hits senses bad. Serve immediately, hot, with your choice of roasted or grilled sides. Don’t skip resting lamb; it's key to juicy tender meat. Use visual, smell, and texture over clock—flexible times ensure no overcooking disasters."
tips:
- "Heat glaze slow medium, swirl or honey sugars burn fast. Thick but still spreadable glaze. Too thick won’t stick evenly, too thin slides off lamb. Watch bubbling carefully, caramel pops tell heat right. Pull off heat once syrupy; continues thickening off flame."
- "Soak wooden skewers minimum 20 mins before use else burn and ash taste. Metal skewers better if skipping soak. Thread lamb and apple tightly alike cubes, firm grip crucial so fruit holds during grilling, avoid dropping bits. Avoid seasoning lamb too heavily before grilling, salt draws juice out risking dryness."
- "Grill hot and fast—listen molten sugar sizzle snap and hiss signals sugars caramelizing right. Flip 2-3 min each side max; edges darken but don’t blacken. Brushing glaze after each flip builds sticky layers. Don’t skip that or glaze won’t cling, dry edges form. Lamb interior pink yet firm, apples soften but keep bite."
- "Thyme leaves added after grill, not in marinade or glaze. Fresh leaves scatter gives herbal punch, thyme’s subtle brightness cuts honey’s sweetness and lamb’s rich heft. Rosemary can be too overpowering here, thyme lighter, fresher. Use fresh, not dried, flavor difference obvious."
- "If no grill, broil in oven watching closely. Flip often. Glaze burns quick so lower rack might help. Potato side roasted foil with garlic and thyme easy, minimal fuss. Avoid over resting lamb after cooking; a brief rest redistributes juices. Too long cools lamb, losing warmth and moisture."
faq:
- "q: How long soak wooden skewers? a: At least 20 minutes. Prevents burning. If skipping soak, metal skewers only. No soak means char and ash taste. Real issue on open flame grilling."
- "q: What if glaze bubbles too fast on heat? a: Pull back heat immediately. Too hot tears sugars, bitterness develops. Low and slow for honey reduction. Thicker syrup needs patience. Stir often avoid bottom scorching."
- "q: How check lamb doneness safely? a: Touch test best. Firm but springs back for medium rare. Visual cues: edges darken, grill marks deep, apples soften but intact. Smell sweet caramel smoke signals proper cooking range."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate wrapped air tight 2-3 days max. Reheat gently to avoid drying lamb. Cold skewers fine chopped in salads. Freeze not ideal glaze texture changes."
