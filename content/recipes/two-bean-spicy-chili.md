introduction: "Red bell pepper and a spicy green chile diced small. Ground beef, lean, breaks apart and browns dark. Garlic crushed fine mingles with cumin and chili powder, smoky and faintly sweet. Beans flow in two colors white and red, soft but firm, rinsed clean. Tomatoes canned, chunky and full, pouring rich juice into the pot. Ketchup adds a little sweet tang, Tabasco'd for fire. The pot simmers low, slow, building depths slowly. Eight hungry mouths are ahead. No milk, no nuts. Gluten gone. Chili bright, sometimes sharp, often warm and hearty. Stir often, watch the bottom, soft bubbles from low flame. Simple pantry stuff does magic."
ingredientsNote: "Red bell pepper diced adds fresh crunch and vivid color but also plays mellow sweet background. Using cubanel pepper keeps heat moderate; swap for jalapeño if you prefer sharper bite. Olive oil chosen for its fruity richness over other fats. Lean ground beef trimmed of excess fat stops chili from being greasy but stays moist. Garlic minced fine releases aroma thoroughly. Chili powder is broad but make sure no additives hidden within. Cumin powder gives earthiness. Two cans of beans — white (navy or cannellini) and kidney — balance textures in spoonful. Tomatoes canned diced supply acidity and moisture. Ketchup adds some subtle sweetness to balance spices. Tabasco sauce is adjustable; pump slowly, taste often. Salt and pepper for finishing seasoning. Ingredients chosen for allergy limitations — no dairy, nuts, eggs, or gluten — keep dish broadly accessible."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating olive oil medium in sturdy pot. Toss in diced vegetables and chopped chiles, softening them about six minutes till fragrant and tender but not mushy. Add ground beef and garlic immediately after stirring to brown meat well and let flavors develop. Spice powders go with meat; stir often to toast slightly, releasing aroma. Salt and pepper help here, but adjust at end. Pour tomatoes and beans after beef browned. Add ketchup for touch of sweetness. Bring whole pot to boil, then shift to low heat and simmer uncovered. Fifty minutes letting chili thicken, flavors marry slowly. Stir every five to ten minutes preventing sticking or uneven cooking. Taste at end for salt level and heat; finish with Tabasco. Serve while hot with crusty bread or preferred side. A slow simmer works best but total time can vary slightly with stove or pot thickness. The result is rich, complex, thick chili with tender beans and well-seasoned beef."
tips:
- "Choose ripe, firm red bell pepper. Dice small. Adds crunch. Sweetness balances heat. If you like spiciness, swap for jalapeño. More heat. Adjust seeds too."
- "Ground beef needs to be lean for best flavor. Fat isn't welcome here. Trim excess before cooking. Keep it moist without greasiness. Brown well, nice crust."
- "Simmer uncovered is crucial. Fifty minutes brings flavors together. Stir often. Prevent sticking. Don’t rush it. Lower heat allows rich taste to develop."
- "Use quality canned tomatoes. Diced is a good choice. Chunky texture enhances chili. Acidity matters. The right balance. Fresh is great, canned works too."
- "Adjust spices at the end. Salt and pepper go a long way. Use Tabasco cautiously. Heat it up gradually. Check taste profiles for balance."
faq:
- "q: How to deal with leftover chili? a: Store in fridge up to 3 days. Reheat on stove. Can freeze too. Thaw overnight. Microwaving works. Stir well."
- "q: Can I make it vegetarian? a: Yes, skip beef. Use lentils or extra beans. Alter spices too, less meatiness. Extra veggies boost flavor. Try it!"
- "q: What to serve with this chili? a: Bread is traditional. Crusty loaf pairs nice. Rice, cornbread also good. For lighter, salad options work great."
- "q: How to thicken chili? a: Simmer longer for thickening. Mash some beans into mix. Add cornmeal or extra diced tomatoes can help too. Balance it out."
