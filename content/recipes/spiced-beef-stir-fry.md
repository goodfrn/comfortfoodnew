ingredients:
- "1.5 pounds flank steak thinly sliced"
- "1 teaspoon cumin seeds ground (sub toasted coriander seeds)"
- "1 teaspoon coriander seeds ground"
- "3/4 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper freshly cracked"
- "1.5 tablespoons red wine vinegar (sub apple cider vinegar)"
- "2 tablespoons avocado oil divided"
- "1 medium white onion thickly sliced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 medium bell pepper sliced (use red or yellow to sweeten)"
- "1 fresh jalapeno sliced thin, seeds included"
- "2 medium tomatoes chopped"
- "1/3 cup loosely packed cilantro chopped"
- "1 teaspoon sumac ground (adds bright lemony tang)"
- "1 teaspoon hot sauce (adjust to taste)"
- "3 cups cooked jasmine rice"
- "4 cups cooked potato fries (frozen or fresh)"
instructions:
- "Step 1 === Combine cumin, coriander, salt and pepper in medium bowl. Add sliced steak, toss well. Drizzle with vinegar plus 1 tablespoon avocado oil. Toss for marinade, let rest minimally 20 minutes; more if you want deeper flavor. You’ll notice marinade thickens and meat softening slightly."
- "Step 2 === Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in large heavy skillet over medium-high heat till shimmering with faint wisps of smoke. Toss in onions, garlic, bell peppers, and jalapenos. You want a sizzle and color, veggies soften but not collapse — about 6 minutes. Look for translucency in onions, and edges starting to brown. Remove from pan, reserve juices stuck on bottom."
- "Step 3 === Without wiping pan (flavor trapped in fond), add marinated steak strips. Spread out, let sizzle, sear to brown edges and lose all pink. Flip and turn multiple sides quickly; takes roughly 5-6 minutes. Err on speed to avoid drying meat. Return cooked veggies to pan with steak. Stir in tomato, cilantro, sumac, and hot sauce. Toss for 3 minutes until tomato breaks down slightly releasing fresh juice mingled with fond aroma."
- "Step 4 === Portion cooked jasmine rice among plates. Spoon beef-vegetable stir fry over rice. Divide fries evenly, place beside beef rather than mixed in until right before eating — fries get soggy fast once wet. Serve ASAP for crisp edges and warm juicy meat contrast."
- "Step 5 === Experimented with substituting sumac for acidity. Adds clean bright lemon flavor without harsh vinegar bite. Also, jalapeno with seeds gives heat but fresh unlike dry chili powder. If pan smoke alarms kick off, reduce heat slightly and ventilate well."
introduction: "Marinating strips of flank steak in ground cumin and coriander wakes up deep, earthy flavors. Tossed with vinegar and avocado oil, it softens but keeps a sturdy bite once seared. Got tired of limp bell peppers that lost crunch last times — this time, I cook just until edges browned but veggies still snap under fork. Noticed how garlic and onions caramelize minimally releasing sweetness while jalapenos add fresh heat, not just burn. Replaced classic vinegar with red wine but often swap in apple cider for softer punch. Fried potatoes stay separate until feeding time — fries carry their crunch longer that way. Added sumac for its subtle lemony tang; trick from Middle Eastern kitchen. A quick after-work stir fry that’s equal parts crunchy, juicy, and zingy. Learning to read sizzle and feel softness has made huge difference in timing and taste."
ingredientsNote: "Ground cumin seeds work better freshly toasted and pulverized for more aroma; pre-ground powders can be dull. Coriander seeds toasted release citrusy notes, but if unavailable, use coriander powder but reduce quantity by 25% or it’ll overpower. Vinegar adds brightness but choose milder types such as apple cider or red wine vinegar to avoid acid bite. Avocado oil holds high smoke point and neutral taste, olive oil left a bitter edge on second try. Swap bell peppers with poblano for subtle smoky flavor or use colorful bell mix for sweetness and visual contrast. Jalapenos sliced thin with seeds provide balanced heat, remove seeds if less spice needed. Tomatoes chopped late to keep moisture but not soggy the sauté, very ripe ones too soft. Cilantro added last minute retains freshness, if allergic, try fresh parsley or basil leaves as surprising swap. Fries: homemade preferred, frozen work but drain well and reheat in oven for crispness. Rice must be fluffy and separate grains; jasmine or basmati best. All measurements flexible depending on personal spice tolerance and ingredient availability."
instructionsNote: "Marinate meat minimum 20 minutes — marinade not only flavors but starts breaking down muscle fibers for tenderness. Toss steak often while marinating to coat evenly. Heat pan until oil lightly smokes to create crust, key for flavor; too low heat and meat stews. Leave steak strips alone for first 90 seconds until crust forms, then toss quickly to brown evenly. Overcrowding pan leads to steaming not searing; do in batches if needed. Removing veggies before searing meat preserves their texture and prevents overcooking; they will finish cooking when reunited with beef. Adding fresh tomato late prevents it turning to mush but allows some juice release to mingle with pan fond, deepening sauce flavor. Sumac sprinkled at the end balances richness with subtle acidity, easy to skip but try once. Fries served on side, never mixed too early — oil moisture wrecks crispness. Keep warm in low oven if prepping early. Watch for smells: onion softening means ready for next step, garlic browning too dark signals bitterness, seared beef smells nutty and caramelized. If meat tough, you may have skipped marinating or overcooked."
tips:
- "Marinate steak at least 20 minutes to break down fibers. Toss steak often so marinade coats evenly. Vinegar adds brightness but milder versions like red wine or apple cider prevent harsh acid. Use freshly ground cumin and coriander from toasted seeds for deeper aroma. Powder works but reduce quantity to avoid bitter or overpowering notes."
- "Heat oil until faint smoke shows. Creates crust fast. Don’t overcrowd pan or meat stews instead of searing. Leave steak strips alone first 90 seconds to get crust going; then toss quickly. Keeps meat tender and juicy. Monitor color change, lose pink but avoid dry edges. Flip multiple times but swiftly."
- "Veggies get brief sear separate from meat. Onions translucent with slight browning edges are cue to pull out. Bell peppers and jalapenos soften but must keep snap. Too long darkens or mushes. Toss them in reserved pan juices later to rescue flavor. Adds depth and moisture without soggy texture."
- "Tomato chopped last to avoid soggy sauté. Mix in with cilantro, sumac, hot sauce for fresh juiciness and tang. Sumac is subtle lemony brightness that balances richer beef without vinegar’s sharp bite. Can skip but changes flavor profile noticeably. Cilantro swaps with parsley or basil if allergic — fresh herbs added late keep color and aroma intact."
- "Fries stay separate until plating. Fries soak oil fast when stirred in early. Homemade fries best but frozen okay if drained well and reheated crisp in oven. Serve fries immediately for crunch contrast with juicy meat. Keep warm in low oven if prepping ahead. Rice needs fluffy, separated grains — jasmine or basmati work best for texture contrast, no clumps."
faq:
- "q: Can I skip marinating? a: You can but expect tougher meat. Marinating softens fibers starts flavor penetration. Without it, seared outside cooks fast but inside might stay chewy. Quick skips okay if pressed for time but flavor less layered."
- "q: What if pan smoke alarms? a: Reduce heat slightly. Heavy pan important but no dry burn. Ventilate kitchen well. High smoke point oils like avocado work best. Olive oil smells bitter sometimes, avoid if possible especially at high heat."
- "q: How to fix mushy fries? a: Drain frozen fries thoroughly, reheat under oven broiler or high heat to recrisp. Stir fries last minute onto plate, never mixed early. If homemade, double fry method works: low temp to cook inside, high temp to crisp outside."
- "q: Alternatives for sumac? a: Lemon zest or a splash fresh lemon juice. Not exact but adds acidity and brightness. Vinegars harsh, sumac milder. Could skip but final tang won’t be same. Try dust sparingly if strong flavor concerns."
