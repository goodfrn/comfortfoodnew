ingredients:
- "1 large carrot diced"
- "1 stalk celery diced"
- "500 ml (2 cups) finely chopped shallots"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "55 ml (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp) all-purpose flour"
- "375 ml (1 1/2 cups) chicken stock"
- "100 ml dry white wine"
- "475 ml (2 cups) cooked chicken diced"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) frozen peas thawed"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) aged cheddar shredded"
- "2 sheets pie pastry"
- "=== Egg Wash ==="
- "1 egg yolk"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) milk"
instructions:
- "=== Prepare Filling ==="
- "Start heating butter over medium. Toss in carrot, celery, and shallots. No leeks here, more bite. Let sweat till veggies soften, around 6 minutes, stirring often. Garlic goes in last minute—don’t let it burn or bitterness ruins the mix."
- "Sprinkle flour evenly, stir for 1 min solid to cook raw taste off but no browning. Pour in stock and white wine, stir constantly until mixture thickens. Watch closely—like custard. Once thick and bubbly, cut heat and lower to a simmer."
- "Add chicken chunks and peas. Stir in cheddar. Melt, then taste. Shouldn’t be bland. Add salt, pepper. More cheese if you want richer punch. Let cool off heat but not cold. Filling thickens as it rests. Right consistency is key; too watery and crust soggy, too dry and it’s crumbly."
- "=== Assemble Pie ==="
- "Crank oven to 190 C (375 F). Put oven rack low, bottom third usually best for golden bottoms. Line 23 cm (9-inch) pie dish with one pastry sheet—press gently but no stretching or rebound. Crimp because you want good seal."
- "Pour in lukewarm filling. Smooth top but don’t press. Cover with second pastry. Vent with 2–3 deliberate cuts. Seal edges by pressing with fork tines—you want a good grip so no escape of steam, no collapsing pie top."
- "Mix yolk and milk for wash. Brush generous, all over top crust edges to get that blazing-gold finish. No shiny spots means dull pie; don’t skimp here. Too much wash can drip and burn, keep on edges mostly."
- "=== Bake ==="
- "Rest pie on cookie sheet to catch spills. Bake 50 min give or take. Look for bubbling steam vent and crust turning full golden brown—edges flaky and top shiny. If top browns too quick first 20 min, loosely tent foil to prevent burning."
- "Crust should feel firm but not hardened. Filling will be bubbling so handle with care once out. Loosen edges if necessary before cutting so crust doesn’t crumble."
- "Let rest at least 10 min. Filling thickens, pie settles. Any less and risky filling runs out on first slice—you want structured slices, not soup."
- "Serve with a simple side—greens or crisp salad to cut richness."
introduction: "Starting with just basics is dull. Carrot and celery rough chopped, shallots sliced fine. Garlic minced so tiny it melts. Butter cracks and foams as it hits warm pan. That smell, soft sweet onion twisting with garlic, fills kitchen. Dust flour, whisk, wait till bubbling liquid thickens—silky sauce rhythm echoes patience. Chicken chunks bob like islands, peas pop green color. Cheese melts in pockets, little gold treasures waiting. Pie crust laid carefully; edges pinched tight by fingers, no mess. Egg wash brushes on shiny gold promises. Oven hums, waiting. The crackle as pie bakes, edges crisp, steam whispers out vent slits. Resting makes cut cleaner; slices hold, savory steam lifts. Comfort food? No. An ode to intuition and simple shifts that work."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping shallots for leeks introduces sharp brightness rather than mild sweetness, which cuts richness better. Flour slightly dialed down, less heaviness in roux, ensures not pasty but silky sauce. White wine splash adds acidity, balances butter and cheese. Butter—real, unsalted for control on salt. Frozen peas, thawed; fresh peas ideal if you got them, but frozen’s convenience beats. Two pie sheets from store fine—remember don’t stretch, cold work best. Egg wash made with yolk only creates shiny golden top; whole egg duller. Milk adds smoothness to wash. Those little details, they change crust all day. No nuts; this is pure comfort, no distractions. Fresh cracked pepper always over pre-ground for vibrant punch in filling."
instructionsNote: "Vegetables sweat and soften first; crucial for flavor release—raw veggies flatten mix. Garlic added late, prevents bitterness. Flour cooks briefly, ensuring no raw taste while stirring; skip this and grit ruins texture. Adding stock and wine creates classic velouté base; keep stirring or it clumps. Simmer barely 5 minutes to thicken; too long breaks sauce down. Cooling filling just right helps prevent soggy bottom; hot filling on dough makes pastry swampy. Vent cuts manage steam escape; crucial if you crave open top crust, no soggy top layer. Egg wash goes edge-heavy for crispness, thin layer key. 190 C steady heat develops crust without overcooking filling. Tent foil if top scorches early; watching is more art than science. Rest post-bake—slice with sharp serrated knife, edges firm not crumbly. Tips? Keep work surfaces cool while handling dough or it tears. Storing leftovers? Cool fully, wrap well; rewarm gently in oven to keep crust crisp."
tips:
- "Heat butter slowly medium, listen for crackle then foam; too hot burns garlic fast. Toss carrot celery shallots early so they sweat out sugar, soft pockets form. Garlic last minute; burns turn bitter. Flour added once veggies softened; stir constantly no browning or grit. Timing here sets sauce base texture, no lumps."
- "Pour stock white wine steady, keep stirring till thick custard-like. Watch edges bubbling; don’t walk away. Thickening signals roux done. Lower heat fast after to simmer or sauce breaks down. Adding chunks should happen once sauce stable else texture ruined. Peas last freeze thaw for color, keep pop."
- "Pie dough must be cold, don’t stretch or rebounds ruin crust shape. Press gently, crimp edges for tight seal. Vent cuts essential no soggy crust; don’t slash messy. Egg wash yolk only plus milk on edges to avoid drips burning, helps golden shine. Brush in thin layer, thicker burns fast."
- "Oven rack low heat hits bottom crust best for golden crisp. If top darkens first 20 min—tent foil loosely; avoids burning but lets steam escape. Cookie sheet catches spill prevents mess. Baking time approx 50 minutes; bubbles steam vent signal filling done. Use touch test; crust firm but not hard."
- "Resting crucial before cutting at least 10 minutes; filling thickens, slices hold shape better. Cutting before rest means runny sloppy slices. Fork loosen edges if crust sticks, use serrated knife for clean cuts. Store leftovers cool fully, wrap tight; reheat gently oven thaw crisp."
faq:
- "q: Why add white wine? a: Adds acidity, cuts richness from butter cheese. Not boozy after simmer; subtle layer flavor. Can swap with dry vermouth or apple cider vinegar splash for different punch."
- "q: How to avoid soggy crust bottom? a: Cool filling off heat before pouring; hot makes dough swampy. Vent cuts critical steam escape. Low oven rack for stronger bottom heat. Dough cold, no stretching keeps texture tight."
- "q: What if garlic burns? a: Bitter taste ruins filling fast. Add garlic last minute on gentle heat. If burnt, start over or mix fresh batch for balance. Can replace garlic amount with garlic powder if rushed."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Cool completely first, wrap airtight foil or container. Refrigerate 2-3 days max. Reheat oven 180 C till warm for crisp crust. Avoid microwave or crust soggy."
