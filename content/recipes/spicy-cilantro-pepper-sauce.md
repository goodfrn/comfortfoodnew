ingredients:
- "40 g (1 cup) fresh coriander leaves and stems"
- "12 g (1/3 cup) fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves"
- "1 garlic clove, halved"
- "1 serrano chili, deseeded and chopped"
- "80 ml (5 tbsp) olive oil"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp) water"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) ground coriander seeds"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) pure maple syrup"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) salt"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) ground cardamom"
instructions:
- "Combine coriander leaves and stems with parsley, garlic, and serrano chili in blender."
- "Add olive oil, water, ground coriander, smoked paprika, maple syrup, salt, and cardamom."
- "Pulse until a coarse, somewhat chunky paste forms. Stop before completely smooth."
- "Scrape sides; blend again for few seconds to integrate everything."
- "Transfer sauce to a sealed container."
- "Refrigerate minimum 2 hours to let flavors meld, up to 5 days."
- "Before serving, stir gently. Use on fish fillets, roasted vegetables, or grilled corn."
introduction: "Green herbs and fire. Coriander and parsley jangling around sharp garlic and a softer serrano. The heat's dull but restless. Ground coriander seeds bring an earthy whisper, smoked paprika adds a charred scent. Maple syrup sneaks in, slight sweetness that pokes at the chili. A splash of water keeps oils flowing free, balancing texture. Cardamom touches a faint perfume, barely there, enough to be noticed but not shouted. This isn't just a sauce; it's on the edge — fresh, spicy, smoky, sweet, herbal. For fish? Sure. For corn? Why not. Anything that needs a kick with a little complexity."
ingredientsNote: "Use fresh, vibrant coriander leaves with stems intact for a livelier base, not just the leafy tops. Parsley adds brightness and a hint of bitterness. Serrano peppers are slightly hotter and tastier compared to jalapeños; deseed for moderate heat or keep seeds in to punch it up. Ground coriander seeds replace cumin, offering a woodier flavor. Smoked paprika adds smokiness instead of clove’s sharpness—keeps spice blend warm but less zesty. Maple syrup instead of sugar gives subtle depth, less flat sweetness. Olive oil must be good quality—fruity over bitter. Water thins; use cold. Cardamom powder for aroma, use lightly. Salt finalizes taste but don't overdo."
instructionsNote: "Put all fresh herbs and serrano in blender first; it chops them finer, releasing essential oils. Then add dry spices along with oil and water; prevents clumping. Pulse short bursts — not a full blend — to keep some texture. Overblending leads to a paste too smooth. Scrape bowl regularly to mix evenly. After blending, seal the sauce in a container and chill at least two hours so flavors marry; can deepen overnight. If too thick, add water dropwise until desired spreadability. Ideal on hot items — grilled fish, roasted corn, or tossed vegetables — where heat and smokiness coax out natural sweetness. Store in fridge; it keeps around 3-5 days. Stir before serving to reincorporate oils that rise to top."
tips:
- "Use fresh herbs. Key is bright flavor. Don't skip stems. They add depth. Wash well. Remove excess water. Then chop fine. Blender does this too. Just not too smooth. Pulse mode. Keep nice grainy texture. Balance between smooth and chunky."
- "Adjust chili heat. Serrano peppers are hotter. Deseed them for less spice. Still add flavor. Keep seeds if you like heat. Handling them? Use gloves. Remember, wash hands after. No touching face. Better safe than sorry."
- "Experiment with herbs. Parsley adds brightness. Mix with cilantro for a fresher taste. Basil could also work. Or mint for something unique. Change spices too. Try adding turmeric for color. Or a bit of ginger for zing. Endless possibilities."
- "Storage matters. Use a sealed container. Fridge is best. Keeps flavor fresh. Use within five days. If too thick, add cold water. Stir well. Thin until desired texture. Always try before serving."
- "Blend time needs thought. Too long makes sauce too smooth. Texture is key. Short bursts, fine control. Scrape sides often. Distribute well. Taste test before chilling. Flavors develop after resting. It's really important."
faq:
- "q: What if it’s too spicy? a: Try adding more oil. Or even more maple syrup. Sweet balance helps tone heat down. Also, serve with yogurt."
- "q: Can I use dried herbs? a: Fresh is ideal. But yes, use dried. Cut dosage down. Stronger flavor. But keep it balanced."
- "q: How to serve this sauce effectively? a: Great on fish as a marinade. Or drizzle over grilled veggies. Use it on corn as well. What more could you want?"
- "q: What's best way to store it? a: Sealed container is key. Fridge extends shelf life. Up to five days is fair. Can freeze it too. But texture changes, keep that in mind."
