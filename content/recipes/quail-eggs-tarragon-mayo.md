ingredients:
- "20 fresh quail eggs"
- "=== TARRAGON MAYONNAISE ==="
- "20 ml wholegrain mustard"
- "5 ml fresh lemon juice"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "150 ml olive oil"
- "10 ml fresh chopped tarragon"
- "Salt and pepper"
instructions:
- "=== COOK EGGS ==="
- "Place eggs in saucepan. Cover with cold water. Heat on medium until just boiling. Count 7 minutes once boil starts. Remove from heat."
- "Drain and transfer eggs into cold water immediately. Let cool 5 minutes. Roll each egg gently between fingers to crack shell, peel from wider end to tip. Keep peeled eggs submerged in cold water."
- "=== MAKE MAYONNAISE ==="
- "Whisk mustard, lemon juice, and egg yolk in bowl. Slowly drizzle oil over while whisking hard to emulsify. Stir in tarragon. Add salt and pepper to taste."
- "=== SERVE ==="
- "Pour mayo into small bowl. Place peeled eggs in egg cups. Provide toothpicks for dipping. Eat chilled or at room temp."
introduction: "Small eggs. Quick boil. Peel under water. Little bites. Mayo thick but bright. Tarragon wild fresh herb twist. Mustard grainy, lemon zesty. Olive oil richer than bland veg. Egg yolk binds. Mix slow drip oil, whisk fast or mayo breaks. Salt, pepper dancing. Hold eggs cool, make neat. Toothpicks for mess free dip. Simple starter. French hint. Herb punch upfront. Balance sharp, creamy, soft. Serve in egg cups. Small, neat plates. Little bites, crunchy shell flakes discarded. Transition from boil to cold water sharp. Short cooking avoids rubbery yolks. Peel slowly. Dip into mayo. Share. Nibble. Mixing smooth and grainy textures. Bite size snack. Tarragon leaf flecks visible through creamy mayo. Details matter, brief punch of heat from mustard. Acid bright. Spoon mayo in ramekin or spread thin. Quick, easy, rustic but refined."
ingredientsNote: "Egg count reduced for portion control. Grainy mustard replaces Dijon for texture and sharper taste. Lemon juice swaps estragon vinegar to brighten acidity and provide fresh citrus note against tarragon. Olive oil takes place of neutral veggie oil, lending slight fruity depth. Tarragon quantity kept same to preserve herb aroma and bite. Salt and pepper adjusted lightly to balance acidity and slight bitterness of lemon. Avoid bottled lemon juice for freshness impact. Use fresh tarragon, chopped fine, to distribute herb flavor evenly through mayo. Optional slight chill before serving enhances herb and lemon notes. Keep peeled eggs moist submerged to prevent drying or membrane stickiness. Mayo made fresh with single egg yolk for richness without heaviness. Mustard quantity scaled down to avoid overpowering but maintain tang. Oil pouring slow, steady—key to stable emulsion. Simple but tweaks add brightness and depth."
instructionsNote: "Start by filling saucepan with eggs, cover completely with cold water. Heat slowly, medium flame. When small bubbles first appear, start timer. Seven minutes, not more or yolks turn chalky. When time’s up, drain quickly and plunge eggs into cold water bath to halt cooking. Wait minimum five minutes to cool thoroughly, easier peeling. Roll each gently, tap shell until cracked. Peel from wider end for membrane ease. Keep peeled eggs water-submerged to stop drying out before serving. For mayo, whisk mustard, lemon juice, and yolk together vigorously. Drizzle oil gently in thin steady stream while whisking hard by hand for controlled emulsification. Avoid fast pouring—breaks mayo. Stir in finely chopped tarragon. Salt and pepper last—balance acidity and herb bitterness. Transfer mayo to serving bowl or ramekin. Arrange eggs in egg cups. Add toothpicks for easy dipping. Serve immediately or chilled. Mayo leftovers can be refrigerated briefly but best fresh. Egg cups prevent rolling or mess. Toothpicks prevent finger mess. Serve simple, casual, visually clean. Use fresh ingredients for best contrast of flavors. Timing and gentle peeling essential for neat, uniform eggs. Small tweaks in acidity and mustard texture change entire flavor profile. Chilled eggs slightly firmer, warm ones softer, adjust cooking to preference."
tips:
- "Start eggs in cold water. Bring to a gentle boil. Count exactly 7 minutes once boiling, no more. Overcook turns yolks chalky fast. Quick cool in iced water bath to stop cooking instantly. Peeling easier and cleaner. Roll eggs gently, dont slam shells. Crack wider end first for membrane lift. Keep peeled eggs submerged in water to avoid drying or sticking. Small details make peel neater and faster. Cold water holding keeps eggs fresh and moist until serving."
- "Mustard texture matters. Wholegrain adds bite, slight grain to mayo. Dijon avoided for smoothness. Lemon juice used fresh only. Avoid bottled. Losing flavor and sharpness changes mayo balance. Oil pouring is slow dripping process to secure emulsion. Fast pouring? Mayo will break and separate. Whisk vigorously by hand not blender. Egg yolk binds but must be fresh. Stir finely chopped tarragon in last. Over stirring crushes herbs. Salt and pepper adjustment last step. Little tweaks change sharpness and bitterness balance."
- "Use egg cups to prevent rolling or mess on plates. Toothpicks essential to keep finger tips clean when dipping. Mayo served in small ramekin or bowl with thin layer spread also works. Temperature affects texture. Chilled eggs firmer bite, room temp softer yolks. Mayo best served just off fridge for herbs and lemon brightness to stand out. Leftover mayo keep tightly covered and cold but consume soon. No preservatives. Egg yolk mayo freshness crucial. Handling timing critical from boil to peel to serve."
- "Peeling under cold water aids membrane slip and removes tiny shell flakes. Don’t rush crack step. Gentle roll then peel from wide end. Membrane removes easier that way. Dry surface on peeled eggs ruins uniform look. Submerging prevents sticky membranes sticking to fingers or plate. Tarring chopped finely, not bruised leaves. Fresh herb aroma concentrated without bitterness. Too much tarragon and lemon shifts balance. Small blend of grainy mustard, citrus acid, and olive oil body needed. Olive oil chosen for subtle fruitiness not neutrality. Texture contrasts key between creamy, grainy, soft."
- "Layer flavors thoughtfully but simply. Mustard punch quick but not overpowering. Lemon juice acid brightens, lifts tarragon aroma. Salt balances bitterness from lemon and herb. Olive oil richness adds slight depth missing in neutral oils. Egg yolk makes mayo thick but avoid heaviness or oily slip. Keep whisk speed high when adding oil. Break too fast, mayo separates. Keep eggs in water until serving avoids drying or cracking. Serve immediately or under slight chill to keep flavors fresh and herbal note strong."
faq:
- "q: How long to boil quail eggs? a: Exactly 7 minutes after water boils is key. Less time? Yolk soft, not set. More? Chalky dry quickly. Start timer once water boils steadily. Don’t let simmer or full rolling boil, gentle medium works best."
- "q: Can Dijon mustard be used? a: You can try but wholegrain preferred for texture and tang. Dijon too smooth, less biting flavor changes mayo taste. Mustard seeds add slight crunch and punch. Alternatives maybe milder but adjust lemon and salt."
- "q: Why peel eggs in cold water? a: Cold water cools eggs fast stopping cooking. Also water helps loosen membrane sticks to shell inside. Gentle cracks easier to remove this way. Dry peeling risks small shell flakes on surface. Water keeps eggs moist, prevents membrane from sticking to fingers or eggs themselves."
- "q: How to store leftover mayo and eggs? a: Mayo best fresh but can refrigerate covered up to 1-2 days max. Keep cold, no reheating. Peeled eggs held submerged in water in fridge 1 day okay. Avoid drying out or sticking. Not for long term, best eaten soon after prep."
