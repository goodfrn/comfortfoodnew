ingredients:
- "1 cup semisweet chocolate chips"
- "1 cup milk chocolate chips"
- "14 oz sweetened condensed milk"
- "1 tsp pure vanilla extract"
- "1 cup heavy cream"
- "3 large egg yolks"
- "¾ cup granulated sugar"
- "6 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "1 cup toasted walnuts (replace pecans)"
- "1 cup sweetened shredded coconut"
instructions:
- "===Fudge==="
- "Line an 8x8 pan with parchment, letting edges hang over for lift-out ease. No butter here or fudge sticks worse."
- "Combine semisweet and milk chips in a large microwave-safe bowl. Pour condensed milk, vanilla on top. Microwave on high, stirring every 25-30 seconds to avoid burning — chocolate should look satin and fully melted but not grainy. Should take about 1.5 minutes total. Stir vigorously to smooth out lumps."
- "Scrape thick chocolaty mixture into pan. Use silicone spatula to spread evenly—thick batter, expect some resistance. If fudgy mix resists spreading, gentle taps on the counter flatten it out."
- "Cover with foil or plastic wrap. Chill minimum 1 hour. Don’t rush or frosting will slide off or melt when spread."
- "===Frosting==="
- "Whisk heavy cream, egg yolks, sugar vigorously in medium saucepan. No lumps. Heat on medium, add butter while stirring constantly until melted—this defuses egg smell and smooths texture."
- "Keep stirring mouthfuls now. Mixture should thicken slowly, start bubbling at edges around 9-11 minutes, not rolling boil—steady bubble formation signals thickening but crucial to prevent curdling."
- "Pull off heat once thickened like loose pudding. Stir in toasted walnuts and shredded coconut. Walnuts replaced pecans here for nearly same crunch but earthier note."
- "Let frosting cool 15-22 minutes uncovered at room temp. Should be cool to touch but still spreadable, not runny."
- "Spread frosting carefully over cold fudge base. Use offset spatula for smooth even layer. If fudge is too cold, wait 3-5 minutes at room temp or frosting tears."
- "Chill frosted fudge at least 1 hour. Cold locks in layers. Cut into 36 squares with sharp knife warmed under hot tap then dried—clean cuts, no mess."
- "Store refrigerated up to 5 days. Let sit 10 minutes before eating for softer bite."
introduction: "Started messing with German chocolate flavor, that sweet coconut pecan combo stuck to me from childhood. Fudge textures tricky though. Tried melting chocolate low and slow in double boilers—waste of time, microwave beats that for me if you stir right. Condensed milk is my shortcut to crowd-pleasing fudginess, sweet and glossy. The frosting is the game-changer; egg yolks in cream mean thick, custardy layer, but watch the heat or it’s scrambled eggs. Pecans are classic but swapped toasted walnuts last batch—nuts on hand, and it gave a nuttier, less sweet crunch. Chill times are flexible if you judge texture. Learn to judge that pudding stage—no eyeballing. My kitchen smells of coconut and chocolate days after messing around here. Fudge chopping gets messy; warm knifes help slice neat. Learned to line pan, always. Sticky nightmare otherwise."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping pecans for toasted walnuts adds a woodsy bitterness, balancing sweet fudge better if you like less sugar sensation. You can use semi or dark chocolate chips alone, but combined milk and semi-bitterness hits a sweet spot. Vanilla essential for depth—don’t skip or use imitation; it dulls whole mix. Heavy cream replacement with half-and-half thins frosting—don’t. Egg yolks provide silky texture; pasteurized eggs crucial if raw eggs worry you or cook carefully to avoid scrambled texture. Butter steadies frosting shine and richness. Sweetened condensed milk is non-negotiable; dry shortening or evaporated milk won’t give fudge firmness. Toast nuts in dry skillet till fragrant, light brown for best crunch and flavor. Coconut can be unsweetened if preferred; adjusts sweetness."
instructionsNote: "Microwave melting chocolate takes practice; stop every 25-30 seconds to stir, avoids graininess and scorching. Once fully melted, stir until sheen appears—this gloss means good melt. Spreading fudge thick needs spatula patience; tapping pan on counter helps even out peaks and valleys—never scrape hard; fudge tears if cold and stiff. Frosting starts liquid; mixture thickens slowly—don't rush your eyes for bubbles. Light bubbling at edges signals thickening; a rolling boil ruins custard, leads to grainy finish. Once thick, remove heat promptly. Stirring nuts and coconut while hot locks in flavors. Cooling frosting 15-20 mins stops layer sliding on fudge—test with touch for jelly-like resistance. Spreading frosting cold fudge benefits from 3-5 mins out of fridge if fudge is rock hard. Patience here avoids torn layers. Cutting fudge with hot knife = less mess and clean lines. Store covered refrigerated; fudge hardens but softens at room temp briefly for eating. Adjust chilling time by feel, not watch."
tips:
- "Heat chocolate chips with sweetened condensed milk in bursts; stop every 25-30 seconds. Stir vigorously until satin sheen appears. Avoid graininess or burning. Patience matters here more than power settings. Microwave is quick, but stirring crucial. You’ll see lumps melt and mixture go glossy; timing varies with wattage. Stirring keeps fudge texture dense not grainy."
- "Spreading fudge thick takes patience. Use silicone spatula with gentle pressure; expect resistance. Tap pan lightly on counter to even batter edges and surface. Don’t scrape too hard or cold fudge tears. Let fudge warm briefly if too stiff. Even small bumps mar texture later. Smooth top helps frosting apply without sliding or tearing layers."
- "Slow cook frosting over medium heat, constant stirring essential. Egg yolks add silkiness but overheat and you get scrambled bits. Look for edges bubbling lightly—not full boil. That bubbling signals thickening but must be steady, low. Timing 9-11 minutes usually. Pull when custard clings loosely like pudding. Too thin, keep cooking longer; too thick and hard to spread."
- "Replacing pecans with toasted walnuts changes flavor profile—more woodsy, less sweetness. Toast nuts dry in skillet until fragrant and lightly browned. Adds crunch and avoids raw nut bitterness. Freshly toasted better than store bought. Walnut oils coat frosting mix locking flavors. Toast nuts right before use, not days ahead, flavor fades and gets rancid after time."
- "Chill fudge base minimum 1 hour. Frosting spreads best if fudge not frozen rock hard but firm. Let fudge sit 3-5 minutes at room temp if fridge-cold to prevent torn layers. Cool frosting 15-22 minutes uncovered till it feels jelly-like but not runny. Spread carefully with offset spatula in smooth layers. Hot knife cuts with minimal mess—run under hot water, dry well before slicing."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid grainy fudge? a: Stir chocolate and condensed milk often during microwave bursts. Stop heat if grainy shows. Satin sheen means good melt. Overheating burns sugars, grainy texture. Keep microwave intervals short, stir vigorously between. Let chocolate fully melt before removing. Graininess often from skipping stirring or too long in heat. Take your time."
- "q: Can I swap walnuts for pecans? a: Yes, roasted walnuts add deeper nutty taste less sweet than pecans. Toast nuts first for best crunch and aroma. Raw walnuts can be bland or bitter. Pecans still classic choice but walnuts hold up well. Also can try hazelnuts toasted if no walnuts or pecans. Texture changes slightly with nut type, adjust frosting thickness."
- "q: My frosting curdles or gets scrambled, what now? a: Stir constantly over medium heat. Avoid high boil—rolling bubbles cause egg to scramble. Pull from heat at pudding-like thickness, with small steady bubbles only at edges. Adding butter while stirring defuses egg smell and smooths texture. If curdled, try whisking vigorously off heat, or cook frosting fresh again. Temperature control critical."
- "q: How to store fudge and keep texture? a: Refrigerate covered up to 5 days. Keeps firm but dry edges appear faster uncovered. Let fudge sit 10 minutes at room temp before eating to soften bite. Can freeze wrapped tightly but may lose some creamy texture. Room temp storage short term encourages melting or sticky surface. Use airtight containers or foil wrap after cutting to lock moisture."
