title: "Lemon Chorizo Roast Chicken"
slug: "lemon-chorizo-chicken"
description: "Whole chicken baked flat with crispy skin, infused with lemon and bold flavors from spicy chorizo, golden baby potatoes roasted alongside garlic and sweet cherry tomatoes added late for burst of acidity. A fusion of rustic and bright elements, this dish balances charred edges and juicy interiors. The lemon cut in half and rubbed directly with salt lifts the bird's flavor while the chorizo melts fat into the pan for savory complexity. Roast fan cooks no further than needed; skin snaps, meat juices run clear, potatoes soft but intact. A green salad finishes the plate. Subtle tweaks on temps and timing for moisture retention, plus texture contrasts from garlic gently releasing aroma intact within skins."

ingredients:
- "1 whole chicken about 1.6 kg 3.5 lb"
- "10 ml 2 tsp coarse sea salt"
- "1 large lime halved"
- "40 ml 2 1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil"
- "600 g 1 1/4 lb small Yukon Gold potatoes halved if large (4 cups)"
- "5 large unpeeled garlic cloves lightly crushed"
- "400 ml 1 2/3 cups sweet grape tomatoes"
- "120 g 4 1/2 oz spicy Spanish chorizo sliced 6 mm thick"
- "Freshly ground black pepper"
- "2 sprigs fresh rosemary trimmed"
instructions:
- "Rack centered, oven preheated to 190 C 375 F convection if you have it. Slightly lower temp helps skin crisp without overcooking flesh."
- "With sharp chef knife or poultry shears, boning out backbone from chicken — flatten it open like a book, lays flat. This truss-free method cooks evenly; traps juices better. Pat dry thoroughly to help skin crisp."
- "Sprinkle salt all over chicken, rub juice of lime halves both on skin and inside cavity. The rough salt abrasion and citrus cut fat bitterness, add tangy brightness. Rest 15 minutes at room temp. Meanwhile, toss potatoes and garlic in 20 ml olive oil, salt, pepper and rosemary leaves stripped from stems. Spread around chicken on baking tray, no crowding."
- "Brush remaining oil over chicken skin slapped with pepper — don't overdo oil, you want a dry skin crisp. Into oven. After 25 minutes, potatoes start softening, edges slightly golden."
- "Scatter tomatoes over potatoes, roast all another 45 minutes. Chicken will have rich mahogany skin that crackles; juices clear when pierced between leg and breast. Potatoes tender, garlic cloves softened but not mushy. If unsure, wiggle drumstick — it should feel loose, not stiff."
- "Turn on grill/broil on high. Arrange chopped chorizo evenly around chicken. Grill 6 minutes, watching closely for chorizo to blister and render fat, edges darkened but not burnt — provides crunch and smoky punch over mellow chicken."
- "Remove pan, tilt slightly to gather pan juices. Spoon over bird, potatoes, and tomatoes. Let rest at least 10 minutes before carving — keeps juices in meat, allows flavors to settle. Serve with sharp green salad as counterpoint."
- "Pro tips: a dry chicken skin means less resting room moisture. Boning chicken open saves cooking time and exposes more skin to direct heat. Adjust potatoes with variety you have; waxy for holding shape, starchy for fluffier interiors. If lacking chorizo, smoked sausage or thick smoked bacon works well, but don’t skip broil — direct intense heat finishes skin and sausage beautifully. Watch garlic carefully; its aroma in skins flavors potatoes subtly without overwhelming."
introduction: "Put chicken and lemon in oven. Spicy chorizo makes a glorious crust. Potatoes soak up all the fat and flavor while roasting in garlic and herbs. Tomatoes added late to avoid turning mushy. Simple but layers of taste develop. I’ve tried many ways to roast chicken evenly — butterflying it flat cuts down on cooking time and yields crisp skin all around instead of wet patches. Rub salt and lime juice into cavity and skin to tenderize meat and add fresh punch. Rest after roasting water seals juices. Chorizo lends a kick but not too overpowering, good balance."
ingredientsNote: "We cut 200 grams off the potatoes to keep the pan less crowded; more space means better roasting, less steaming. Lime swapped for lemon for a twist, softer acidity. Oil reduced a bit to keep skin crisp without flaking. Rosemary added for aromatic lift but optional. Chorizo thickness increased slightly to capture more mouthfeel and juiciness when grilled on top. Garlic cloves left unpeeled; their skins protect the garlic from burning while releasing fragrance. Any sturdy potato variety works but Yukon Gold preferred for creamy interior and thin skin. Keep salt coarse; fine salt dissolves too fast and toughens skin. If no chorizo, sub with smoked paprika spiced sausage slices or finishing bacon chunks for smoky undertone."
instructionsNote: "Sharp knife or kitchen shears make one neat clean cut of chicken backbone— minimal tearing avoids moisture loss. Rub minced garlic inside cavity for extra punch if desired. Let chicken sit 15 minutes after salting and rubbing acid —  this dry brine phase key to crisp skin and juicy meat. Use visual cues over time: chicken skin tightens and turns deep gold,  potatoes shrivel slightly at edges but soft when pierced, tomatoes soften but hold shape. Grill phase crucial for chorizo crisping without burning; don’t walk away, the smell gets intense fast. Resting bird is often overlooked but crucial for final tenderness and juiciness. Pouring pan juices over just out of oven keeps everything moist. Smoke or char edges mean flavor complexity; don’t fear darkened bits but don’t burn either."
tips:
- "Flatten the chicken after removing backbone using kitchen shears sharp enough for clean cuts. Avoid tearing skin; tearing traps moisture with inadequate crisping. Resting chicken after rub with salt and lime for 15 minutes - dry brine phase critical. Helps skin snap, meat tender. Visual cues, skin turning deep golden with tight tension, beats timed guesses."
- "Coarse salt for rub - fine dissolves too quick, toughens skin. Use lime halved and rub juice inside cavity plus skin. Adds zing, cuts fat bitter notes. Roasting potatoes halved for even cooking; toss with crushed unpeeled garlic cloves and rosemary stripped off stems to avoid woody flavor. Spread in single layer to prevent steaming, promotes browning."
- "Monitor chorizo closely under broiler grill, 6 minutes tops. Watch edges blister and darken but avoid black spots. Rendered fat melts into pan for rich flavor lift. If no chorizo, thick smoked bacon or paprika-spiced sausage slices work but still broil for crisp finish. Grill phase key for crunch and smoky punch, don't skip or undercook."
- "Use Yukon Gold or waxy potato varieties – creamy interior plus skins thin enough to crisp with roasting. Avoid overcrowding pan; fewer potatoes produce more heat circulation, browning not steaming. Garlic cloves unpeeled protect flesh from burning while releasing aromatic steam slowly under roasting heat — subtle flavor blast without mushiness."
- "Rest roast chicken at least 10 minutes off heat, covered loosely. Keeps juices inside muscle fibers instead of running out on cutting board. Pour pan juices over chicken, potatoes, tomatoes for extra moisture and flavor harmony. Watch chicken juices run clear when pierced between leg and breast as doneness check - jiggle drumstick; loose means done, stiff means more time needed."
faq:
- "q: Why flatten the chicken? a: Butterfly cuts cooking time notably. Skin exposed on all sides crisps better. Removes backbone so lays flat, traps juices inside meat. No trussing needed, juices don’t pool underneath. Moisture retention better, skin texture sharper."
- "q: What to sub if no chorizo available? a: Smoked sausage, thick cut bacon chunks, or paprika-spiced sausage slices all work. Flavor tradeoffs but still smoky punch if grilled. Skip broil phase and it’s softer, less crisp. Broil critical for charred edges and rendered fat benefits. Adjust cook times accordingly."
- "q: Garlic burning during roast? a: Leave skins on cloves, works wonders to shield from direct heat. Crushed lightly to crack skin, helps aroma disperse inside jacket but keeps soft on bite. If garlic burnt, flavor goes bitter. Roast in pan with potatoes, better distribution of heat. Avoid direct contact with pan base if too hot."
- "q: How to store leftovers safely? a: Cool quickly, place in airtight container. Fridge up to 3 days works. For longer, freeze chicken and potatoes separately wrapped tight. Tomatoes best fresh, add later if reheating. Reheat gently in covered dish to avoid drying chicken skin. Pan juices saved separately keep moisture when reheated."
