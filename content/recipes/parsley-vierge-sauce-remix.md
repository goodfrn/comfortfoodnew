ingredients:
- "65 g (2 1/4 cups) fresh flat-leaf parsley, including stems"
- "12 g (1/4 cup) roughly chopped cilantro leaves, replacing fennel fronds"
- "3 green onions, cut into chunks"
- "1 garlic clove, halved"
- "1 lemon, finely grated zest"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) lemon juice"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) Tabasco sauce"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) honey, adjust for balance"
- "50 ml (about 3 1/3 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) capers, coarsely chopped"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Dump parsley, cilantro, green onions, and garlic into food processor. Pulse in short bursts. Don’t blitz into paste; still want texture. Keeps sauce alive • Stop, scrape sides once or twice to avoid uneven chop."
- "Add lemon zest and juice, Tabasco, and honey. Pulse a few more times until mixture looks thick but not a puree. Remember, this should look fresh and chunky not a paste."
- "Transfer to bowl. Pour oil slowly while stirring with a spoon to emulsify loosely—not thick, just mixed."
- "Fold in chopped capers last. Season with salt and pepper. Taste. Sometimes more acid needed, add lemon juice. Or honey to tame sharpness."
- "Rest 10 minutes if you can. Flavors marry better. If rushed, serve at once. I’ve used this on grilled pork, fish, shrimp—never disappoints."
introduction: "Chopped herbs. Bright acid. Bit of heat. Oil to carry flavor. I swore by fennel fronds once, but cilantro tugs more freshness now, less anise punch. Garlic gives body, onions bite. Lemon juice and zest, both hit different ways—zest lifts aroma, juice punches tartness. The honey trick? Not everyone gets it, but it smooths out Tabasco’s sharp edge. Tried blending too much; lost character. Sauce should crackle with texture. Capers crushed just right, not watery or pasty. Always keep sauce fresh, cool moment before plating. Yesterday I drizzled over pork roast—smoke met herb brightness, a contrast that just sings. If you want it smoother, try emulsion like mayo but I prefer that chunky charm. This sauce makes whatever protein feel alive."
ingredientsNote: "This parsley-based sauce is forgiving, swap cilantro or basil for fennel fronds for different aroma layers. Green onions bring a mild onion flavor, but scallions or chives work too. Garlic should be fresh; avoid powder for that sharp hit. If honey isn’t on hand, agave syrup or even a touch of sugar balances acid and spice. Use good olive oil—cheap bottles fade flavor fast. Capers can be replaced with chopped green olives for a briny note, or anchovy fillets if no allergies and you want savory punch. Adjust lemon zest amount depending on how aromatic your lemons are. Salt strategically—capers add saltiness, so taste before adding too much. Keep herbs dry, wash and pat down to prevent watery sauce. Chopping finely but not pulsing too much ensures vibrant texture. If the sauce separates, whisk a little extra oil or lemon juice to bring it back. Store leftovers covered in fridge no more than two days to keep freshness."
instructionsNote: "Food processor is key but pulse in short intervals. Over-processing loses the rustic texture so important here; chunks of herbs and veggies create bursts of flavor and visual interest. Scraping down sides prevents uneven chopping—essential to get everything finely but not mushy. Adding oil off the blade helps control emulsification, keeping it light, not mayonnaise heavy. Capers added at last moment retain their bite and briny crunch rather than dissolving into sauce. Taste throughout. Acidity and sweetness depend on fruit ripeness and personal palate. Sometimes I add extra zest for brightness or more honey if lemon is sharp. Let sauce sit at room temp 10 minutes if possible for flavors to marry. Don't cover in metal as it reacts with acids, plastic wrap or ceramic bowl preferred. Great to whip this up last minute before grilling. Texture and aroma will tell you when it's right: fresh, herby, lively, just enough punch—not dull, not squeaky sweet. If it looks watery, drain a bit of liquid from capers or add more herbs. Always serve within 24 hours as raw herbs fade."
tips:
- "Pulse herbs and aromatics briefly in food processor. Stop before paste forms. Texture depends on timing. Scrape bowl often to ensure even chop. Small bursts avoid mush. Chunky bits carry fresh flavor better than smooth purees."
- "Add lemon zest and juice after chopping herbs. The zest lifts aroma; juice hits tartness. Adjust acidity after taste test. Honey balances sharpness, but add little at first. Tabasco for heat. Layering rather than mixing all at once keeps flavors distinct."
- "Slowly drizzle olive oil off the blade while stirring to emulsify lightly, not heavy mayo texture. Oil binds but keep sauce pourable. Over emulsifying dulls brightness and rough texture hunters want in parsley vierge style sauces."
- "Fold in capers at end to keep crunch. Capers give salty, briny bursts not lost if added last. Chop roughly. Alternative: chopped green olives or small anchovy bits fiddle with flavor depth. Salt last since capers add saltiness; taste throughout."
- "Rest sauce 10 minutes at room temp if possible. Herbs release aroma better. Don’t rush. Flavors marry without losing crunch or freshness. Refrigerate covered max two days. Leftovers thin out; whisk in lemon juice or oil if separation occurs."
faq:
- "q: How long to pulse herbs? a: Very short bursts. Stop as soon as herbs chopped evenly but still chunked. Overprocessing makes paste, loses fresh texture. Scrape sides to catch all bits. Important for mouthfeel."
- "q: Can I swap cilantro back to fennel fronds? a: Yes. Fennel adds anise aroma, cilantro fresher, brighter. Basil works too for different notes. Herb swaps shift complexity. Try and see which side you prefer."
- "q: Sauce too watery or separated? a: Usually overprocessing or wet herbs. Dry herbs before chopping. If watery, drain caper brine or add chopped fresh herbs to tighten. Whisk a bit more oil or lemon juice to bring back cohesion."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Covered in fridge max two days. Herbs fade quickly. Keep cold but not frozen. Stir before serving. Avoid metal lids touching sauce; plastic wrap or ceramic is best. Consume fast for best bite and aroma."
