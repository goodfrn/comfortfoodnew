ingredients:
- "=== Tahini sauce ==="
- "35 ml (2 1/3 tbsp) water"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) tahini"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) maple syrup"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) lemon juice"
- "=== Carrot soup ==="
- "1 large onion, chopped"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "540 g (4 cups) carrots, peeled and sliced"
- "1 parsnip (about 200 g), peeled and cubed"
- "1.5 liters (6 cups) vegetable broth"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "90 g (1 cup) broccoli florets, blanched and chopped"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) toasted pumpkin seeds"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Tahini sauce ==="
- "1. Mix water, tahini, maple syrup, and lemon juice in a small bowl until smooth. Adjust consistency; sauce should be pourable but creamy. Set aside."
- "=== Carrot soup ==="
- "2. Heat olive oil over medium-high. Toss in onion. Stir often, cook till translucent and slightly golden. The sweet smell signals caramelization; don't rush or burn it."
- "3. Add carrots and parsnip. Stir to coat with oil and onion remnants. Roast in skillet for 5 minutes if you want deeper flavor, or go directly to the broth in the pot."
- "4. Pour in vegetable broth, sprinkle smoked paprika. Salt and pepper moderately. Take a whiff—earthy spice, subtle heat will build."
- "5. Bring to a gentle boil, then lower heat. Simmer, covered, for 35-40 minutes. Check veggies by poking; should feel very soft but not falling apart."
- "6. Remove from heat. Carefully blend soup in batches to avoid splashes—use an immersion blender or transfer to a countertop blender. Aim for silky texture; a few tiny vegetable bits add rustic appeal."
- "7. Stir in half the blanched broccoli to warm through—keep some raw if you want more crunch and freshness."
- "8. Ladle soup into bowls. Garnish with remaining broccoli, toasted pumpkin seeds. Drizzle tahini sauce over top in zig-zag or circular patterns for eye appeal."
- "9. Serve immediately. Optional: a squeeze of fresh lemon or a crack of black pepper right before eating awakens flavors."
introduction: "Carrot soup's deceptively simple. But trust me, roasting or caramelizing unlocks depths others miss. Parsnip swaps the usual potato for subtle sweetness and fibrous texture. Broccoli’s vegetal bite balances the creamy carrot base—different textures matter. Tahini sauce? That earthy nuttiness with maple syrup sweetness and lemon zip borrows cues from Middle Eastern kitchens, but tweaked for my taste. Toasted pumpkin seeds—yes, seeds over sesame—offer crunch and a seasonal twist. A hit in my kitchen: soup rich but light, savory with sweet undertones, warm spice, fresh lemon punch. This isn’t your last-minute recipe unless you have prepped broth and veggies on hand. Worth the time. Mix, taste, tweak. Soup is living food."
ingredientsNote: "Tahini sauce is forgiving. If thick, thin with water, one teaspoon at a time. Maple syrup can be swapped for honey or agave but maple gives that deep round sweetness without florals. Use vegetable broth for vegan or chicken stock if you want richer flavor. Parsnip here—texture and sweetness different from potato’s starch; celery root is another substitute. Broccoli? Blanch to soften, brighten flavor. Raw chunks bring textural contrast but too much raw and soup feels uneven. Toast pumpkin seeds in dry pan over medium heat until fragrant and lightly browned; watch closely to avoid bitterness. Smoked paprika instead of cumin gives warmth with subtle smoke, better matches roasting aroma. Onions must be soft and slightly caramelized for best base flavor; raw or undercooked leaves soup flat. Timing flexible if you monitor softness: poke carrot slices with fork, tender means ready. If soup too thick, add broth or water when blending for desired consistency."
instructionsNote: "Start caramelizing onions on medium-high so they develop sweetness but don’t burn—stir often. Toss in carrots and parsnip to coat with oil and residual fond, helps deepen flavor before adding broth. Pour broth and immediately cover to trap steam and reduce cooking time. Check softness around 30 minutes by stabbing carrots; if resistant, continue cooking but stir occasionally to avoid sticking or uneven cooking. Blending batches prevents uneven pureeing and hot splashes, especially if using countertop blender; cool slightly if you’re wary of burns. Stir in some broccoli at end to warm through but retain green color; add last minute to keep crunch if preferred. Garnishing with slightly crunchy seeds adds contrast—don’t skip. Drizzle tahini sauce last; sauce thickens in fridge, stir before serving. Adjust seasoning after blending; cooking mutes salt and pepper. Soup can sit covered on very low heat, stir occasionally but do not boil again to keep texture intact."
tips:
- "Caramelize onions on medium-high. Listen for soft sizzle, watch color shift from translucent to golden edges. Stir often; burnt aroma kills soup base. Timing varies; don’t rush, aiming for sweet, mellow depth without bitterness."
- "Roast carrots before adding broth if you want flavor punch. Toss sliced carrots and parsnip in oil in hot skillet. Five minutes is good start; edges brown, aroma sharpens. Skip roasting for fast track, but less complexity."
- "Blanch broccoli briefly in salted boiling water. Bright green, tender crisp. Overcook and broccoli loses snap, greens turn dull. Reserve half raw for texture contrast, intense fresh pop against creamy soup."
- "When blending, do in batches. Hot soup splatters; handle blender discharge carefully. Use immersion blender if worried; easier control. Add broth or water to thin if thick, teaspoon by teaspoon. Adjust seasoning after blending, salt fades in cooking."
- "Pumpkin seeds toasted dry, medium heat. Smell nutty, see light browning. Watch fast. Too dark bitter. Swap sesame seeds if preferred but pumpkin adds distinct texture, earthier crunch."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute parsnip? a: Yes. Celery root works similarly, adds mild sweetness and fibrousness. Potato too starchy, changes texture more. Adjust cooking time, celery root can soften quicker or slower depending on size."
- "q: What if tahini sauce too thick? a: Thin with water, small amounts; teaspoons at a time. Thick tahini stalls drizzle, ruins plating. Maple syrup can swap for honey or agave; maple keeps deep sweetness sans floral notes. Lemon juice balances bitterness, don’t skip."
- "q: Soup too thick or thin after blending? a: Add broth or water to loosen. Blend more for smoothness but some bits add rustic feel. Too thin? Simmer uncovered briefly. Don’t boil again; ruins texture and dulls color."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Fridge in airtight container 3-4 days. Sauce thickens cold, stir before serving. Soup freezes well; use freezer-safe container. Thaw slow in fridge or warm gently on stovetop; reheat gently, avoid rapid boiling."
