ingredients:
- "=== Herb crust ==="
- "90 ml mixed fresh herbs, chopped (parsley, thyme, tarragon)"
- "2 shallots, minced finely"
- "20 ml smoked Maldon sea salt"
- "10 ml crushed pink peppercorns"
- "1 beef rib roast with bone, 1.4 to 1.6 kg"
instructions:
- "1. Mix herbs, minced shallots, smoked salt, and pink peppercorns in a bowl. Set aside 20 ml for garnish."
- "2. Preheat half of the barbecue to high heat. Oil the grill grate on the lit side."
- "3. Place the roast on a tray. Rub herb mixture evenly over beef, save some for serving. Rest 12 minutes."
- "4. Position roast on unlit side of grill. Close barbecue lid. Cook about 1 hour 5 minutes for medium rare or until internal temperature reaches 58°C (136°F)."
- "5. Remove roast from grill. Wrap loosely in foil. Let rest 12 to 16 minutes."
- "6. Take off the bone carefully. Slice beef. Sprinkle reserved herb mix on top."
introduction: "Beef rib roast. Fat marbled through muscle. Hearing the sizzle is half the thrill. Herbs chopped fine. Tarragon switched in for a twist. Shallots instead of garlic for sweeter notes. Smoked salt gives bite. Pink peppercorns add subtle fruity heat. Charcoal smoke works magic. Bone-in for deep flavor. Cook indirect on grill. No hurry but no drag either. Resting crucial. Locked in juices. Slice shows rosy interior. Herb crust crunchy, savory punch. Meat juicy. Simple but bold. Rustic elegance on plate. No dairy, no gluten. Just primal carnivore with herbs. Perfect for backyard feast. Letting smoke and herbs do the talking. Minimal fuss. Maximum character. Food with soul. Cooking and quiet anticipation. Carving reveals all."
ingredientsNote: "Fresh herbs vital here. Parsley brings freshness, thyme earthiness, tarragon subtle anise notes. Mix them up, chopped small to coat beef well. Shallots give gentle sweetness, easier on stomach than garlic, less pungent but aromatic. Smoked Maldon salt swaps grains of original sea salt, adds subtle smoky nuance without extra steps. Pink peppercorns crushed coarse for texture and gentle heat, replacing harsh black pepper. Roast size around 1.4 to 1.6 kg to cook evenly yet remain tender. Bone-in ensures flavor depth and slower temperature rise inside. Oil grill grate to prevent sticking. Reserve some herb crust dry mix for sprinkling when serving to freshen aroma and add crunch."
instructionsNote: "Start by mixing herb crust fully to release aromas and combine flavors. Preheat grill half only: high heat on one side to create indirect cooking zone – essential to avoid charring exterior. Rub herb crust all over beef, evenly pressing so it sticks and flavors seep. Let rest before grilling; herbs start penetrating meat. Position beef on cold side of grill, lid closed to trap heat. Monitor temperature; aim for 58°C for medium rare. Cooking time varies; watch carefully. Resting after cooking locks juices inside, keeps meat tender. Bone removal easier post-rest. Slice carefully against grain. Sprinkle reserved herb mixture after plating to brighten flavors and texture. Serve immediately with simple sides or smoky accompaniment."
tips:
- "Mix fresh herbs finely chopped. Parsley, thyme, tarragon key. Small pieces stick better. Herbs must cover beef evenly. Herb crust thick enough to hold but not clumpy. Keep some dry mix aside for after cooking sprinkle. Herbs start flavor infusion during rest before cooking. Rest time important to hydrate herbs. No garlic here, shallots replace. Gentler aroma, milder after cooking. Use smoked Maldon salt coarse but not too coarse to avoid heavy crust."
- "Grill setup crucial. Half fire high heat only, other half off. Oil grill grate well where fire is on. Use indirect heat side for beef placement. Avoid flare ups, avoid charring crust. Lid down traps smoke and heat evenly. Check temp with probe, aiming 58°C medium rare. Can last 60-65 minutes. Timing variable by weight and grill setup. Err on side of temp rather than time. Let heat cycles do work slow cause bone slows heat transfer. Patience needed."
- "Rest roast after removing from grill. Loose foil wrap only. Rest 12 to 16 minutes minimum. Crucial for reservoir of juices to redistribute. Bone easier to remove after rest. Slice against grain only after bone removed. Slicing while bone in awkward. Herb crust crunchy texture changes after cooking and resting. Reserved herb mixture freshens plating. Sprinkle top just before serving to add fresh green pop and leftover aroma. Helps brighten visual and flavor contrast with smoky deep meat."
- "Use 1.4 to 1.6 kg beef rib for more even cooking. Bone adds flavor but slows core temp rise. Uniform size helps with timing. Shallots minced really fine, avoids chunky pieces, spread more evenly in herb crust. Pink peppercorns crushed for less heat, more texture and subtle fruity fragrant punch. Avoid black pepper, harsher, overwhelming. Smoke from charcoal vital for depth. Wood chips optional but charcoal alone enough. Avoid pushing meat close to flames to keep herb crust intact."
- "Oil grill grate on lit side only, not on indirect side. Prevents sticking on hot zones. Keep herb crust in place once rubbed in. Avoid flipping roast during cooking. One side contact only rest indirect area. Keeps crust consistent. Bone removal post-rest easier, fat rendered softened, connective tissues relaxed. Slice thin or thick depending on preference, but slicing against grain always. Herb mix reserved acts as final seasoning layer, add without saturating meat surface to maintain textural balance."
faq:
- "q: How to check doneness without probe? a: Use finger press method somewhat. Firmness increases with temp but tricky on bone cut. Check color inside from edge if you cut small end slices. Aim for slight rosy pink if medium rare. Timing estimates help but probe better. Wait times vary by grill heat consistency."
- "q: Can I substitute herbs? a: Parsley thyme tarragon chosen for balance. Swap tarragon for oregano or rosemary but flavor shifts more woody or pungent. Tarragon gives anise hint. mix herbs chopped small for max adhesion. Herb freshness key for aroma. Dry herbs less vibrant. Adjust salt amount if swapping Maldon smoked salt with regular."
- "q: Roast crust soggy after cooking? a: Usually not resting long enough or too much moisture on meat before herb rub. Pat dry completely. Herb crust should be dry mix. Rest under foil loosely but not sealed tight. Soggy crust means steam trapped. Also avoid flipping roast during grill cooking. Indirect heat prevents crust burning but preserves crunch if no excess moisture."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap sliced meat loosely in foil or airtight container. Consume within 2 days for best flavor. Reheat gently in oven at low temp or covered skillet to avoid drying out. Leftover herb crust loses crunch fast, add fresh herbs on reheat. Bone can be kept refrigerated separately or added to stew stock later but not indefinitely in fridge."
