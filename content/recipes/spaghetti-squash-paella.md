description: "Seafood paella meets roasted spaghetti squash. Courge spaghetti replaces rice, saving time and carbs yet trapping flavors like a sponge. Chorizo spiked with smoked paprika and chipotle gives heat layering. Tomatoes and white wine build the base. Mussels and cod fold in succulent ocean taste. Peas add pop. Butter blends in silky richness. Parsley freshens the finish. No eggs, nuts, or gluten. Oven-roast the squash till tender but still al dente—avoid mushy. Heat seals chorizo fat, then quick simmer to marry flavors. Watch seafood closely; mussels open wide, shrimp curl tight. Every step tuned to textures and aromas. No floury mess, just vibrant layers with ocean breeze notes."

ingredients:
- "1 medium spaghetti squash about 1.1 kg (2.4 lb)"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "120 g (4 oz) spicy chistorra sausage sliced"
- "1 medium yellow bell pepper diced"
- "1 medium shallot finely chopped"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "2 medium garlic cloves minced"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) chipotle chili flakes or to taste"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) turmeric powder"
- "100 ml (about 1/2 cup) dry vermouth"
- "400 ml (14 oz) canned fire roasted diced tomatoes drained"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) vegetable broth"
- "400 g (14 oz) fresh mussels cleaned"
- "200 ml (3/4 cup) thawed green peas"
- "350 g (12 oz) cod fillets cut into chunks"
- "400 g (14 oz) shelled medium shrimp thawed"
- "40 ml (3 tbsp) fresh chopped flat leaf parsley"
- "Salt and cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack mid-level. Preheat oven to 200 C (390 F). Line baking tray with parchment or foil. Clean squash, halve lengthwise, scrape out seeds but keep membrane intact. Salt and pepper flesh lightly—seasoning penetrates shallow flesh well. Place cut side down on tray. Roast until flesh yields with a skewer but not mushy; around 40-45 minutes depending on size. Let rest 8 minutes. Using fork, shred flesh into strings, keep warm and toss with butter. Butter key to silky strands rather than drying out."
- "While squash roasts, heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high. Add chistorra sausage slices and fry until fat renders and edges crisp, about 4 minutes. Add diced pepper and shallot, sweat till slightly soft but with bite, around 5 minutes stirring frequently. Garlic joins last minute to avoid burning. Toss in smoked paprika, chipotle flakes, and turmeric, stirring to bloom spices until fragrant—around 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper thoughtfully; sausage imparts saltiness."
- "Pour vermouth to deglaze pan, scrape browned bits, let simmer briskly to reduce by half. Add fire roasted tomatoes with juices and vegetable broth, stir and bring to gentle boil. Lower heat to simmer and reduce 3-4 minutes to thicken and blend acidity and spice."
- "Add cleaned mussels and peas, stir gently then cover. Mussels should open after 3-4 minutes—if some stay shut, discard. Next, fold in cod pieces and peeled shrimp. Cover again and cook 4-5 minutes stirring once or twice carefully so fish cooks through and shrimp pink up but stay tender. Pay attention to doneness here or risk rubbery seafood. Taste broth, adjust salt and pepper."
- "Just before serving, mix chopped parsley through sauce. Spoon generous portions over warm buttery spaghetti squash strands, letting juices mingle with the mellow sweetness of squash. Garnish extra parsley or lemon wedges for acidity if desired."
- "Watch squash texture. Over-roasting collapses fibers and leaves watery base. Under-roasting tough and crunchy. Flicker of orange hues from turmeric and chipotle brings warm earthiness. Chistorra packs more garlic bite than chorizo and less greasy residue. Swap vermouth for dry sherry if handy—both give aromatic lift. Use vegetable broth instead of chicken for full pescatarian twist. Peas add subtle crunch and burst of sweetness mid-bite. Parsley freshness crucial in cutting richness and balancing sea flavors."
introduction: "Roasting squash takes patience; you want tender but with texture, no mush. The spaghetti threads soak butter—fat brings silkiness. Chistorra over chorizo for sharpness and less oil slick. Spice mix shifts to smoky paprika and earthy turmeric instead of saffron for budget and flavor layers. Vermouth, tomatoes, broth merge into a rich broth thick with umami undertones. Timing the seafood just right keeps the shellfish plump without rubbery shrimp or dry cod. A dance of textures and tastes. Leftovers reheat nicely, though best eaten fresh for shellfish clarity. Always taste before salt—sausage and broth manage richness already. Simmer too long, mussels close up or dry out. The peas burst, bright contrast to red sauce. Parsley finish refreshes bitter herbal notes. Lean on sight and smell; when mussels open and juice reduces, you’re there."
ingredientsNote: "Use fresh or frozen seafood; thaw seafood properly and pat dry to avoid soggy sauce. Fresh mussels need scrubbing shell grit removed. Chistorra is spicy, sub with chorizo but drain fat well or sear on paper towel. Yellow bell pepper swaps for red for less sweetness balancing acid. Turmeric instead of saffron for color and earthiness at less cost. Vermouth adds herbal complexity, a wine works too if needed. Butter blends into squash strings gives silk and binds flavors inside strands. Peas can be frozen, thawed not cooked again to avoid mush. Parsley brightens fatty base; flat leaf preferred for vibrant herbal taste. Vegetable broth keeps pescatarian option intact, chicken broth adds deeper base notes. Roast squash uncovered to get slight caramelization in cut flesh which adds hint of nuttiness but cover if over-browning. Timing crucial: can roast in advance but add butter last minute or squash strands dry out and clump."
instructionsNote: "Roast squash cut side down to trap steam yet promote softness, check by piercing with skewer—should yield but resist falling apart. Rest before shredding helps fibers settle. Render sausage in hot pan—not too hot or garlic burns; garlic added last minute for aroma only. Spices bloom in oil; aroma signals when ready to add liquids. Deglaze pan with vermouth to loosen browned bits—deep flavor key to rich sauce. Simmer until noticeably thick and sauce coats spoon. Adding mussels early ensures even cooking and shells open fully. Add delicate fish last to avoid overcooking; fold carefully to keep chunks intact. Cover pan to trap steam for shellfish but stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Use fresh parsley stirred in very last to avoid losing vibrancy or turning bitter. Season taste test is personal—sausage salt and spice vary by brand. Don’t overcook shrimp; size shrinks and flesh tightens; shrimp pink and opaque is your cue. Serving pile high buttery squash first; the sauce poured warm and chunky. Crunch from peas adds depth. Leftover squash can be reheated gently in pan with butter, avoid microwave for texture."
tips:
- "Roast squash cut side down to trap steam and soften fibers yet avoid soggy mess. Check with skewer; want tender but holding shape. Rest squash after roasting, juices settle, strands shred easily and stay separate. Toss immediately with butter, key for silky texture that coats each string, prevents drying and clumping."
- "Render chistorra carefully on medium heat. Too hot and garlic burns fast. Add garlic last minute just for aroma. Bloom spices in oil: paprika, chipotle, turmeric. Watch color and smell, not time. Oil carries flavors. Deglaze with vermouth scraping brown bits gives deep umami backbone; simmer to thicken sauce until coating spoon."
- "Add mussels early, covered; they open signaling done. Toss peas with mussels, thawed only, no extra cooking or mush is risked. Fold in cod and shrimp late; delicate, cook fast. Cover still, stir gently once or twice to avoid breakage. Pay attention to shrimp color and texture; pinch test if needed. Overcook rubbery disaster."
- "Substitutions: chistorra can go for chorizo but render fat off or dab with paper towel to avoid greasy finish. Yellow bell pepper swapped if sweetness unwanted. Vermouth may be replaced with dry sherry or white wine; both add herbal acidity. Use vegetable broth for pescatarian, chicken broth if okay for richer base."
- "Squash strand texture key; overroast and fibers collapse into watery base. Underroast and it crunches too much. Timing varies with squash size; check between 40-45 minutes but never walk away. Butter last minute or squash strands dry out when reheated. Reheat gently in pan with butter, avoid microwave for best texture retention."
faq:
- "q: How to know when spaghetti squash is done roasting? a: Skewer test works best. It should pierce flesh easily but not fall apart. Look for slight caramelization on cut edges no mushy spots. Rest after roasting; juices settle. Overroast and strands collapse, underroast stays tough. Timings vary based on squash size and oven."
- "q: Can I substitute chistorra with other sausages? a: Yes. Chorizo works but render fat well or pat dry to avoid grease build-up. Other spicy sausages possible but adjust seasoning for salt levels and spice mix. Cooking times similar. Texture matters too; some sausages break down differently so monitor closely."
- "q: How to avoid rubbery seafood? a: Add mussels early so they open fully, discard closed ones. Shrimp and fish fold in near end, cook 4-5 minutes covered. Stir gently once or twice to keep pieces intact. Watch shrimp pink color and firmness as a cue. Overcooking firms muscle fibers and toughens texture fast."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Keep squash strands and seafood sauce separate if possible to avoid mush. Refrigerate up to 2 days. Reheat gently in pan with butter, stirring often. Avoid microwave; heats unevenly, ruins strands texture. Freeze sauce only; seafood can get rubbery when frozen. Thaw overnight slow."
