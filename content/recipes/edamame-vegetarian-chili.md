description: "Hearty vegetarian chili with edamames, green beans, and smoky chipotle powder instead of regular chili. Tomatoes, kidney beans, sweet potatoes give texture and body. Sweetened lightly with maple syrup replacing molasses. Simple aromatics sautéed to bring out savory base. Thick, chunky, simmered until flavors meld well, with vegetable broth added for balanced consistency. Garnished with sour cream alternative and fresh cilantro leaves. Gluten and nut free, egg free, spicy but controlled. The dish warms, smells intense, and looks vibrant with rich red, green and yellow tones."

ingredients:
- "2 onions, sliced thin"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced fine"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "2 red bell peppers, seeded cut into big chunks"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) chipotle chili powder"
- "1 can 540 ml (19 oz) diced fire-roasted tomatoes"
- "1 can 540 ml (19 oz) black beans, drained rinsed"
- "280 g (2 cups) frozen shelled edamames"
- "130 g (1 cup) chopped green beans"
- "1 medium sweet potato, peeled diced small"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) vegetable broth or water"
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) dairy-free sour cream or plain yogurt"
- "Fresh cilantro leaves"
instructions:
- "=== Chili ==="
- "Start softening onions and garlic in hot oil on medium heat. Don’t rush, wait till onions look translucent and smell slightly sweet. Stir often to keep from browning too fast."
- "Add red peppers and chipotle chili powder, fry just 1-2 minutes until pepper starts to soften and spices become aromatic. The smoky note wakes up here - no skipping this step."
- "Dump in tomatoes, black beans, edamames, green beans, diced sweet potato, and maple syrup. Pour vegetable broth in too. Give a good stir to mix everything well."
- "Raise heat till you see the stew gently bubble up. Lower heat so it simmers calmly—not a roaring boil. Cover partially, cook about 35-40 minutes. Stir regularly, check sweetness and pepper balance."
- "Watch for liquid level. Add splash of water or broth if too thick. The sweet potato breaks down, thickening the chili naturally but you want that saucy texture."
- "Season at the end. Salt first, then pepper. Taste often, there’s a balance between sweet from potatoes + maple and smoky heat from chipotle."
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "Serve warm, spoon a dollop of creamy dairy-free sour cream or plain yogurt over each bowl. Sprinkle fresh cilantro leaves generously."
- "Bright green herbs cut through richness, cooling and fresh. Try lime wedges on side – tang adds zing. Optional but worth it."

introduction: "Edamame in chili? I’ve found it’s a hidden winner. Adds punchy texture and protein without the heaviness of meat or typical beans alone. Used to rely on canned kidney beans only, but tossing in black beans changes the flavor profile, deeper, earthier. Sweet potato instead of molasses—simpler and mellower sweetness, blends into the veggies, no funkiness molasses sometimes brings. That smoky chipotle instead of plain chili powder gives a richer note, no fire-breathing heat but complexity. Banged around the kitchen with this for hours, learned the thickening cues, the smell changes, how to keep veggies colorful yet cooked through. This chili sticks to ribs firmly without being stodgy. Hearty but fresh."
ingredientsNote: "Switching molasses for maple syrup keeps the chili unexpectedly sweet and mellow without overpowering the smoky spice. Black beans replace kidney beans here to lend a creamier, less firm texture. Sweet potato chunks also serve as natural thickener and add earthy sweetness. Edamames survive the simmer better than other frozen veggies; no mush. If you don’t have chipotle chili powder, use smoked paprika mixed with cayenne to approximate the smoky heat. The red bell peppers add sweetness and crunch; swapping yellow for red changes the color vibrancy but not essentials. Use either vegetable broth or water. Just don’t skip liquid—you need it to stop scorching. Good oil means taste here, vegetable or sunflower."
instructionsNote: "Start low and slow with onions and garlic until soft and fragrant; this builds a base full of umami and sweetness. Toss peppers and chipotle in next: the oil becomes smoky, smells rich. This is your flavor spike. Tomatoes and beans go in next, then the green beans, edamames and sweet potatoes. This is thick stew territory so the 35-40 minute simmer isn’t negotiable—it’s where chunks soften, meld flavors, aromas bloom. Stir every 5-7 minutes, look for simmer bubbles, and if edges stick or smell sharp, splash in broth or water. Don’t cover fully or stuff will turn soggy, you want slight evaporation. Salt last—early salting can toughen beans. Garnish cools, brightens, balances fat. Got cream allergy? Use coconut yogurt. Let chili rest 10 minutes after cooking; that’s when it truly shines."
tips:
- "Start onions and garlic slow in oil till translucent, no browning or burning. Hear soft sizzling, smell sweet aroma rising. This slow sweat sets savory base. Stir often, medium heat only. Rushing here leads to bitter edges instead of deep flavor notes."
- "Add chipotle powder after peppers soften slightly. Fry 1-2 minutes to wake smoky notes but don’t burn spices. Oil carries flavor; coat veggies well. If no chipotle, smoked paprika + pinch cayenne works but scale to taste, can get hot fast."
- "Tomatoes, beans, and chopped sweet potato in next. Sweet potato chunks act natural thickener later, no flour or cornstarch needed. Use fire-roasted canned tomatoes for depth. Edamame stays firm, not mushy after simmer compared to peas or other frozen veggies."
- "Simmer uncovered or partially covered—don’t fully seal pot or chili steams soggy. Watch gentle bubble, not rolling boil. Stir every 5-7 minutes to prevent sticking and check liquid. Add broth or water sparingly, too thick turns clumpy, too thin watery flavor."
- "Salt near end, pepper last after tasting balance. Early salting can toughen beans or veggies. Sweet syrup complements smoky heat; don’t overdo maple syrup or chili loses edge. Fresh cilantro and dairy-free cream finish bright, rich notes. Lime wedges optional but add zing."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen instead of fresh veggies? a: Yes but timing matters. Frozen edamame holds well, green beans can get soft too quick. Add frozen vegetables during last half of simmer to avoid mushy texture. Fresh preferred for peppers and onions to keep crunch and aroma."
- "q: What if I don’t have chipotle chili powder? a: Substitute smoked paprika plus cayenne powder. Mix to taste, start small cayenne can burn early. Other options include chili powder blends but flavors less smoky. Adjust maple syrup less if substitute is sweeter."
- "q: How to fix chili if too thick or thin? a: If too thick, splash vegetable broth or water, stir in, simmer short to integrate. Too thin? Cook uncovered longer, let liquid reduce. Sweet potato also thickens – if less, add more diced sweet potato early in cook."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Cool completely before refrigerating in airtight container. Keeps well 3-4 days. Freeze in portion bags for 2-3 months. Reheat gently on low to avoid toughening beans. Stir while warming, add splash broth if thickened too much."
