ingredients:
- "170 ml sugar"
- "7 ml cornstarch"
- "3 eggs"
- "85 ml lemon juice"
- "25 ml melted unsalted butter"
- "vanilla ice cream"
- "crumble topping"
- "whipped cream"
instructions:
- "=== LEMON CUSTARD ==="
- "Mix sugar with cornstarch in saucepan. Whisk in eggs, lemon juice, and butter until smooth. Heat gently stirring constantly with whisk. Bring to slow boil for about 7-10 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat. Transfer to bowl and let cool until lukewarm to slightly chilled. Cover and place in fridge to set slightly while preparing other components."
- "=== ASSEMBLY ==="
- "In sundae glasses, add one or two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Spoon lemon custard over ice cream, spreading gently. Using piping bag fitted with star tip, pipe rosettes of whipped cream on top. Sprinkle crumble topping generously over whipped cream and edges. Serve immediately or refrigerate for 5-10 minutes if preferred cooler but best enjoyed before crumble softens."
introduction: "Cold. Sweet meets sour. Creamy ice cream with tart lemon. Crunchy bits. Quick to make yet layered with textures. Lemon custard thickened with cornstarch, cooked slowly, holds just right between runny and solid. Butter for richness. Eggs give body and acidity. Topped with whipped cream, light and airy. Crumble adds bite and warmth. Scoop vanilla ice cream, not too hard. Spoon lemon layer hot or cooled. Whip cream fresh; pipe neat rosettes. Finish with crumble on top. Chill briefly if you like, but crumble better crispy. The mix of cold, sharp, soft, crunchy keeps tongue guessing. Simple technique, layered flavors. Ideal for summer nights when heat demands cold dessert but punch of lemon wakes palate."
ingredientsNote: "Reduce sugar slightly to balance lemon tartness. Cornstarch thickens but keeps lemon sauce smooth—no lumps. Eggs need gentle heat to avoid curdling. Melted butter added last keeps silky texture, no graininess. Lemon juice freshly squeezed for bright acidity, not bottled. Vanilla ice cream serves as base, not overpowering so lemon shines. Use store-bought crumble or homemade with flour, sugar, butter toasted lightly for nutty crunch. Whipping cream should be chilled for best volume; pipe right after whipping to keep form. If preferred, add lemon zest for extra aromatic note or swap vanilla ice cream for lemon sorbet to amplify citrus. Butter can be replaced with coconut oil for dairy-free twist."
instructionsNote: "Start with mixing sugar and cornstarch dry for even distribution. Slowly incorporate eggs and lemon with vigorous whisking to prevent lumps. Heat gently over medium, stirring constantly to avoid scrambled eggs. Once thickened, remove from heat immediately to preserve smooth texture. Cool in shallow bowl to speed process. During assembly, scoop ice cream directly into serving glasses to avoid melting. Pour lemon custard warm but not hot, so ice cream melts slightly but not fully. Pipe whipped cream carefully using star tip for texture contrast and presentation. Scatter crumble liberally for textural bursts. Serve promptly for crunchy topping or chill for short time but expect crumble to soften."
tips:
- "Use fresh lemon juice for acidity. Bottled juice lacks flavor. Adjust sugar based on lemon tartness. Test taste before cooking custard. Keep eggs at room temperature."
- "Cornstarch thickens gently. Prevent lumps by whisking well during cooking. Don’t rush. Low heat maintains smooth texture. Remove from heat as soon as thickened to avoid overcooking."
- "Assemble quickly. Scoop ice cream into glasses before it melts. Pour warm lemon custard over ice cream to create contrast. Pipe whipped cream next for height."
- "Crumble topping adds crunch. Use store-bought or homemade. Lightly toast to enhance flavor. Add nuts or oats for extra texture. Keep it separate until serving."
- "If needed, stabilize whipped cream. Pinch of gelatin or cream cheese helps maintain shape longer. Use chilled equipment for best volume. Store leftovers covered but expect softening."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Yes. Try lime or orange. Adjust sugar as needed. Tartness varies. Experiment but keep balance in mind."
- "q: What to do if custard curdles? a: Immediate cooling helps. Blend to smooth it out. Strain if necessary. Prevent in future by gentle heat."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Crumble likely to get soft fast. Best eaten fresh. But can refrigerate a day."
- "q: Can I make ahead? a: Yes, but assemble close to serving. Custard can chill, ice cream stays in freezer. Just add crumble right before serving."
