ingredients:
- "2 cups elbow macaroni or similar pasta"
- "2 medium zucchinis quartered"
- "1 ripe avocado pitted and peeled"
- "1 handful fresh basil leaves"
- "1 cup fresh spinach roughly chopped"
- "2 Tbsp butter divided"
- "2 Tbsp all-purpose flour"
- "1 1/4 cups whole milk or substitute almond milk unsweetened"
- "1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese"
- "1/4 cup nutritional yeast"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper"
- "optional red pepper flakes to taste"
- "1 cup cherry tomatoes halved"
- "1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese for topping"
instructions:
- "Start boiling salted water for pasta. Cook elbow macaroni just shy of al dente about 8-9 minutes. Test bite for slight firmness. Drain and set aside keeping pasta warm."
- "Meanwhile grab a medium pot. Fill with water enough to cover zucchini. Bring to rolling boil. Add quartered zucchini and let cook 12-18 minutes until you can pierce with fork easily, not mushy. Drain thoroughly."
- "Transfer zucchini to food processor while still warm. Add avocado flesh and basil leaves. Pulse blend till creamy but not watery. You want a thick green paste almost like pesto but thick."
- "Heat skillet over medium. Melt 1 Tbsp butter until foaming but not browned. Stir in flour with whisk, cook 1-2 minutes until it's fragrant and golden, no burning."
- "Slowly whisk in milk bit by bit avoiding lumps. Once smooth add zucchini-avocado puree. Toss in chopped spinach and other Tbsp butter. Stir constantly letting spinach wilt and sauce thicken. Should reach thick creamy consistency that clings to spoon after 7-9 minutes."
- "Lower heat. Stir in cheddar cheese and nutritional yeast until melted and fully incorporated. Season with salt, pepper. Add red pepper flakes here if you like a kick. Sauce should be rich and velvety, spinach evenly dispersed."
- "Add cooked pasta to skillet along with halved cherry tomatoes. Fold gently but thoroughly coating pasta and tomatoes with sauce. Heat together just 1-2 minutes to warm tomatoes without softening too much."
- "Serve immediately in bowls with extra shredded mozzarella on top to melt from residual heat or pop under broiler briefly for bubbly browned finish. Use sharp cheese if sweeter mozzarella bugs you. Best right away."
- "If sauce too thick add splash more milk or pasta water to loosen. If too thin simmer longer but watch so it doesn’t scorch or get grainy. Avocado keeps it creamy without heavy dairy but can darken fast so serve soon."
introduction: "Green mac attacks the senses before you even get to fork. The boiling of zucchini is crucial; underdone means rubbery vibes, overdone turns it to mush. Zucchini’s mildness needs an umami buddy—enter avocado and basil, creamy and fresh, blending into something luscious not watery. The roux, classic butter-flour base, anchors the whole mess, thickening sauce without clumps if you pay attention. I never just toss spinach in – it wilts slowly in sauce, lending earthiness. Cheese and nutritional yeast carry the savory torch, red pepper flakes optional but addictive when they hit the palette alongside sweet, popping cherry tomatoes. Mozzarella topping melts, adds stretch and glow. Timing is about feel not clocks. Pasta texture best tested by bite not timer. Tried sour cream instead of avocado once—different, tangier, but avocado wins for silkiness. A greenish macaroni surprise."
ingredientsNote: "Elbow pasta is classic but penne or shells swap well for catching sauce pockets. Zucchini should be fresh and firm; older veg means watery puree—drain it well if needed. Avocado brings creamy texture, but could replace with silken tofu or even mild cream cheese if you want richer mouthfeel. Basil fresh is non-negotiable for brightness, though parsley or cilantro flips the flavor profile if you’re feeling experimental. Spinach fresh or frozen works; frozen needs defrosting and squeezing dry. Milk whole preferred for creaminess, but almond or oat plant milk can keep it lighter—add a pinch of turmeric or smoked paprika to boost color if using nut milk. Cheese sharp white cheddar best but anywhere from gouda to gruyere shifts vibe; nutritional yeast adds depth but can be left out if not vegan. Butter could switch to olive oil for dairy-free. Cherry tomatoes optional for pop but try sun-dried tomatoes for chew. Season boldly, salt is your friend."
instructionsNote: "Getting pasta timing right is key—under boiling beats mush every time. Watch the zucchini boil—fork tender means a gentle poke not a squish; overboiled zucchini kills texture and flavor, you want it yielding but intact. Puree must be thick enough to anchor sauce, watery mess kills sauce body. Roux-made sauces break down fast if you rush adding liquid—slow whisking prevents lumps. Adding cold milk straight into hot roux shocks it, start slow. Wilt spinach slowly in sauce, don’t just dump it in – big clumps turn limp and strange. Cheese melts at gentle heat; high heat risks binding and grainy texture. Add pasta last, gently fold to avoid smushing tomatoes. Mozzarella topping adds a final touch; hit it under broiler if you want bubbly crust but watch carefully or it burns. Leftovers reheat with splash milk stirred in, no drying out."
tips:
- "Boil zucchini until fork pierces easily but avoid mush. Drain very well or waterlogged puree ruins sauce body. Timing varies so poke test not clock only. Zucchini softness sets base sauce texture."
- "Roux needs gentle golden color, smell changes from raw flour to nutty. Add milk slowly or sauce clumps. Whisk constantly. Cold milk shocks roux - pour slow, keep heat medium low. Patience here."
- "Spinach wilts better in gentle heat; dump it in chunks, stir slow. Fast heat turns it limp, watery. Wilt takes 7-9 mins commonly. Sauce thickens gradually, looks creamy and sticks to spoon before cheese."
- "Cheese melts best on low heat. High heat risks grainy texture or binding. Stir cheddar and nutritional yeast in slow, watch melt then incorporate fully. Season at this stage with salt, pepper and optional flakes."
- "Pasta timing crucial; undercook macaroni slightly al dente. Fluffy but toothsome. Hold warm but don’t let dry. Fold sauce gently with tomatoes last - heat just 1-2 mins to warm, keep tomatoes fresh pop."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid watery sauce? a: Drain zucchini well. Puree firm not watery. Add milk slow, not dump. Watch spinach wilt slow. Roux taste signals if undercooked. Sauce thickens after 7 minutes simmer usually."
- "q: Can I swap avocado? a: Silken tofu works with lemon for tang. Cream cheese also richer but different flavor. Basil is bright note, parsley/cilantro changes profile totally. Crunchy nuts or cooked bacon add texture contrast."
- "q: What if pasta overcooks? a: Drain fast, rinse cold to stop. Toss in sauce off heat or add splash pasta water to loosen thickened sauce. Overdone pasta loses bite and makes dish mushy, avoid if possible."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Chill fast in airtight. Reheat with splash milk or pasta water to loosen sauce. Microwave or stove low heat. Mozzarella topping melts less on reheating, add fresh if desired. Use within 2 days."
