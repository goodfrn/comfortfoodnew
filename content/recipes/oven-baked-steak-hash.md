ingredients:
- "2 1/2 cups frozen shredded hash browns"
- "3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 cup chopped bell peppers (mixed colors)"
- "1/2 cup chopped yellow onion"
- "1 cup sliced baby bella mushrooms"
- "10 ounces sirloin steak, thinly sliced"
- "freshly ground black pepper to taste"
- "6 large eggs"
- "1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese"
- "1/2 cup diced tomato for topping"
- "sour cream for serving"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 430 degrees. Spray an 8-by-8-inch baking dish lightly with nonstick spray. Toss hash browns with melted butter and salt in dish; use the back of a spoon or spatula to press evenly into bottom. Slide into oven uncovered. Look for start of browning edges and slightly firm top — around 18 to 22 minutes. Pull out when the edges crisp and the surface feels mostly set but still a bit soft under finger."
- "Meanwhile, warm a skillet on medium heat. Add oil—watch it shimmer, but not smoke. Toss in bell peppers and onions. Stir and spread around, cooking until onions turn translucent and start caramelizing around 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms last; cook until their moisture evaporates and edges brown, about 3 minutes. Remove all veggies to a plate, drain excess liquid."
- "Turn heat to medium-high on same skillet. Season sirloin slices with salt and pepper liberally; no skimping. Lay pieces flat, let them sear without moving too much. Listen for a light sizzle; once the edges brown and the color shifts (about 3-4 minutes), flip or stir just enough to give all sides a bit of crust. Avoid overcooking—steak needs to stay tender inside. Set aside quickly to rest."
- "Lower oven to 350 degrees. Crack eggs in a bowl, whisk vigorously to blend yolks and whites fully. Pour evenly over the partially baked hash browns — spread slowly; some may shift. Sprinkle cheese in a thick layer over eggs, then distribute steak slices and sautéed veggies evenly, avoiding any liquid from pooling on the surface. Return to oven for around 27 minutes. Watch for egg filling to puff and lightly brown—edges firm, center just set but still moist."
- "Once done, pull from oven and resist slicing immediately. Let rest 10 to 12 minutes—this lets residual heat finish cooking and the layers firm up for cleaner cuts."
- "Serve with fresh diced tomato spooned on top and a generous dollop of sour cream. The cold tang balances the hearty warm layers underneath."
introduction: "Started off thinking of a simple breakfast casserole involving hash browns and eggs only but adding sirloin changed the game. Steak needs quick sear—not overdone or it gets rubbery, so medium-high heat is crucial. I found sautéing veggies separately helps keep their texture instead of steaming in the egg. Two-stage bake—hash browns first then eggs with toppings—makes for crispy base, avoids sogginess. Timing is flexible if you watch edges for crispness, eggs for puffiness and jiggle. Mixing sharp cheddar rather than mild cheese brings out flavor punch, balance richness. Sour cream on top adds a sharp tang, brightens the plate. Learned to discard excess liquids from steak and veggies; watery bake ruins texture. Best when rested properly. Experiment with bell pepper colors for visual pop and slight sweetness."
ingredientsNote: "2 1/2 cups frozen hash browns works well for texture and ease, but fresh shredded can be substituted—just squeeze excess moisture before using. Butter lends richness and ensures browning crisp crust; butter replacement with olive oil is doable but changes flavor and texture, possibly less crisp. Salt is essential—not just seasoning but draws some moisture out from potatoes aiding crispness. Bell peppers add sweetness and crunch; any color mix fine, red and yellow sweeter than green. Onions must be translucent with light caramel color to avoid sharp bite. Baby bella mushrooms deliver earthiness; white button mushrooms okay but less flavor. Sirloin preferred for tenderness, but any lean steak or even ribeye trimmed of fat can work—adjust cook time accordingly. Eggs—fresh, large. Cheese can be sharp cheddar or a blend with Monterey Jack, mozzarella for milder profile. Tomato topping is fresh finish; if unavailable, try salsa or chopped fresh herbs. Sour cream balances richness but Greek yogurt is a tangier swap."
instructionsNote: "Starting oven hot at 430 ensures hash browns crisp without overbaking egg layer. Press hash evenly to avoid thin spots that overbrown or undercook. Baking uncovered encourages moisture evaporation—don't cover or foil, avoids sogginess. Sauté veggies separately to control their doneness and prevent steaming from wetness. Use moderate heat—low and slow caramelizes onions but keeps them soft; mushrooms added late to avoid turning mushy. Steaks get fast sear on medium-high for texture contrast—don’t crowd pan or they'll steam instead. Salt steak generously before cooking to season inside out; seasoning post-cooking is too late. Egg pouring over hot hash browns requires gentle spread to avoid disturbing crust; whisk eggs well to promote uniform cooking and fluffiness. Cheese placement on top promotes golden crust and helps seal in steak and veggies underneath. Lower oven temp for second bake to prevent overbaking stew-like eggs but allow slow setting. Resting bake essential to firm up layers, aids slicing; skipping leads to messy, runny squares. Discarding extra liquid improves texture—moisture dilutes egg and softens potatoes, making dish gluey. Serve immediately after resting for best mouthfeel."
tips:
- "Hit oven hot first at 430 degrees. Makes bottom hash crisp fast. Press hash firmly. Uneven pressing means burnt spots, or soggy gaps singing out. No cover foil; steam ruins crust. Watch edges carefully; brown just right, not black. Timing varies oven to oven. Sleeve out finger test helps. A slight soft spot okay but not wet."
- "Sauté peppers and onions slow on medium heat. Patience for caramel color. Too high heat burns edges; too low, soggy onions. Mushrooms last. Adds earthiness. Water from veggies dilutes egg layer; drain liquid well. I drain on paper towel sometimes; best texture. Keep colors vibrant; red & yellow peppers bring sweet pop."
- "Sear steak slices hard on medium-high. Listen for sizzle crisp sound. Flip fast after edges brown. Avoid moving too much; crust is flavor. Salt first, liberally; pulls flavor inside. Overcook and you get tough bites. Let steak rest on plate briefly; carryover heat evens out doneness. Thin slices cook fast, adjust if thicker."
- "Egg wash spread slow over hot hash. Whisk yolks and whites fully. Pour gently to not break crust. Cheese thick on top seals filling; adds golden crust too. Next, evenly scatter steak and veggies. Avoid pooling liquid on top or will burn wet spots. Oven down to 350 for gentle set. Puff and jiggle edges tell you timing; pull before dryer."
- "Rest after baking—makes cutting cleaner. Ten minutes minimum. Layers firm, not floppy. Skip rest, omelet squares mess on plate. Tomato topping adds fresh acid contrast. Sour cream or Greek yogurt works here for creamy tang. Substitute sharp cheddar with combo cheeses—Jack melts better, mozzarella milds sharpness."
faq:
- "q: How do I avoid soggy hash browns? a: Press firmly before baking. No foil cover. Bake uncovered high heat first stage crisp edges. Drain excess moisture from frozen hash if fresh. Timing key. Watch browning signs. Soft top okay but not wet patches."
- "q: Can I use other steaks? a: Sure. Ribeye trimmed works but add cook time because thicker. Leaner cuts like flank need quick sear then rest to avoid toughness. Adjust slices thickness. Season well before cooking. No skipping salt; penetrates meat."
- "q: What if veggies release too much liquid? a: Drain well. Paper towel helps soak extra water. Mushrooms tricky; cook till edges brown, moisture gone. Add last to onions and peppers after partial cook. Avoid steaming in pan; slowly caramelize instead."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool completely before fridge. Airtight container. Best eaten within two days for texture. Reheat gently in oven 300 degrees to crisp edges again. Microwave makes soggy layers. Can freeze but expect some texture loss on thaw."
