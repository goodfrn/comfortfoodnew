title: "White Chicken Chili"
slug: "white-chicken-chili"
description: "A slow cooker white chicken chili loaded with shredded chicken, beans, bell pepper, and a blend of warming spices cooked low and slow. The dish finishes with fresh cilantro and tangy yogurt for balance. A twist swaps out plain yogurt for sour cream, adding creaminess and tang. Swapping bell pepper for poblano adds smoky depth. Timing is flexible but watch for chicken shredding ease and broth reduction. Serve topped with jalapeño slices and lime wedges to cut through rich flavors. Beans cook until tender but not mushy; chicken should fall apart with gentle fork pressure. This chili trickles aromas of cumin and oregano throughout the kitchen as it simmers."

ingredients:
- "2 cans white beans drained and rinsed"
- "4 boneless skinless chicken breasts"
- "1 medium onion diced"
- "1 poblano pepper diced"
- "4 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 tbsp chili powder"
- "2 tsp ground cumin"
- "1 tsp dried oregano"
- "1 tsp kosher salt"
- "1/2 tsp black pepper"
- "4 cups low sodium chicken broth"
- "1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro"
- "1 cup sour cream"
instructions:
- "Layer beans on the bottom of a slow cooker. Next add chicken breasts whole."
- "Scatter diced onion, poblano, and garlic over chicken."
- "Sprinkle chili powder, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper evenly across the top."
- "Pour chicken broth over all, ensuring it barely covers the ingredients."
- "Cover and cook on low setting for around 7 ½ hours. Listen for a gentle simmer, occasional bubbling sounds."
- "Remove chicken carefully, shred it with two forks—should pull apart with little resistance."
- "Return shredded chicken into the pot and stir through fresh cilantro and sour cream. The soup will thicken slightly and mellow."
- "Keep lid off for 10 minutes if too thin, or add a quick slurry of cornstarch in cold water to thicken."
- "Serve immediately topped with extra sour cream, sliced jalapeños, and lime wedges on the side."
introduction: "Started out frustrated. Beans and chicken together always tricky. Tried layering wrong once—beans stuck to bottom, scorched. Learned to put them down first, then chicken. The way spices bloom cooking low and slow—I swear you can smell them lift the whole house. Onion and poblano soften but still hold texture. Chicken should shred easily, no rubber bands allowed. Swapped out bell pepper for poblano last time, added earthy smoky note, changed game. Sour cream finishes this chili with tang and that velvety touch yogurt cannot always nail. Lime and jalapeños? Critical pops. Don’t rush. Slow to get right but worth every minute of patience."
ingredientsNote: "By starting with dried beans soaked overnight and par-cooked, you can skip canned for more control if feeling ambitious. Poblano replaces bell pepper for deeper flavor, though any sweet pepper is fine. Swapping sour cream for Greek yogurt is common—yogurt is tangier, sour cream richer; both can split if overheated so stir in off heat. Taste and adjust salt since broth varies. Garlic—don’t overload or it can turn bitter after hours. Onion size depends on preference; caramelized alone much stronger. Always drain beans well to avoid cloudy broth. Fresh cilantro added last brightens the whole pot but omit if you dislike, use parsley as safety net."
instructionsNote: "Low and slow here is key—high heat risks drying chicken out or uneven bean cooking. Check broth volume halfway through; add a splash if too reduced or leave uncovered if too watery near end. Shredding chicken is tactile test—you want it tender but not falling apart immediately in pot or chili becomes mush. Always remove chicken for shredding to avoid stringy pieces in soup. When stirring in sour cream, take pot off heat and mix gently to avoid curdling; it adds creaminess without dulling flavor. Extra jalapeño slices on top give contrast but add carefully; can overwhelm otherwise subtle spice. Lime wedges brighten and cut richness just before serving—don’t skip."
tips:
- "Beans go first. Put them right at bottom so no sticking later. Canned or soaked dried beans okay but soak dried overnight then par-cook for control. Scorching beans ruins broth clarity. Chicken breasts whole, do not dice before cooking; shredding much cleaner after slow cook."
- "Poblano instead of bell pepper. Adds smoky, earthy note. Not overpowering if diced medium size but bigger chunks keep texture. Onion softens but don’t caramelize here; want some bite to balance slow cooked stew."
- "Chili powder and cumin ground well before sprinkling. Layer spices on top after vegetables settle. Keeps flavors bright, lets aroma open up slow. Salt last; broth varies. Adjust at end. Garlic can turn bitter with too long slow cook, so use moderate amount; don’t overload."
- "Slow and low is non-negotiable. High temps dry chicken or make beans mushy. Listen for gentle simmer sounds, tiny bubbles break slowly. If broth reduces too fast, add splash water mid-way. Leaving lid off at end thickens without starch. Keep an eye, timing flexible."
- "Remove chicken to shred. Use two forks, pull gently but fully apart. Should not shred under reticent pressure—otherwise dry. Return shredded chicken last, fold in sour cream and fresh cilantro off heat to avoid curdling. Sour cream richer than yogurt but sensitive to heat; stir gently."
faq:
- "q: Can I use dried beans only? a: Yes but soak them overnight. Par-cook or pre-soak before adding. Avoid dry beans straight in—beans remain hard, broth murky. If short on time use canned but rinse well."
- "q: What about bell pepper instead of poblano? a: Sure, sweeter with less smoky depth. Bell peppers soften quicker, poblano gives earthiness. Any sweet pepper works, just adjust cook time for texture preferences."
- "q: What if chicken won’t shred? a: Cook longer on low, chicken’s tough if underdone. Let rest briefly after removing—fibers relax. Use two forks, tear along grain but no shredding means it wasn’t slow-cooked enough or breasts too thick."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Fridge up to 4 days. Use airtight container. Freeze okay but texture shifts; beans sometimes soften more. Reheat gently on stove. Add extra sour cream fresh, lime wedges last minute."
