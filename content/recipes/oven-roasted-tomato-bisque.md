slug: "oven-roasted-tomato-bisque"
description: "Roasting beefsteak tomatoes and shallots with garlic infuses deep, smoky notes. Slow skimming key for clear, rich broth. Swapping basil for fresh tarragon adds subtle anise tang. Using vegetable stock instead of chicken gives a lighter, cleaner base. Watch the skin blister and pull away, a sign to peel perfectly. Blend just enough for texture, not baby-food silk. Salt celery replaced with smoked paprika for warmth. Quick roasting under high broiler, then simmer for gentle softening. Step-by-step favors sensory cues over rigid timings. Toss in a splash of cream or coconut milk to tame acidity if needed."
metaDescription: "Oven-roasted tomato bisque blending smoky roasted tomatoes, shallots, fresh tarragon, and smoked paprika. Rustic texture keeps it hearty, creamy off optional."
ogDescription: "Roast tomatoes close, hear crackle, smell shift. Tarragon twist, smoked paprika warmth. Blend rough, toss in cream or coconut milk if acidity bites."

ingredients:
- "9 large beefsteak tomatoes halved, seeds removed"
- "2 medium shallots quartered"
- "3 cloves garlic unpeeled"
- "3 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "750 ml vegetable broth approximate"
- "fresh tarragon handful"
- "salt and black pepper to taste"
- "optional splash coconut milk or heavy cream"
instructions:
- "Position oven rack close to broiler element. Preheat broiler on high."
- "Toss tomatoes, shallots, garlic cloves, olive oil, smoked paprika and some black pepper in bowl. Spread evenly on rimmed baking sheet."
- "Roast vegetables under broiler 10–12 minutes until skins bubble and blacken in spots. Smell shifts smoky and sweet."
- "Cool slightly; peel tomato skins off—should slip away with little resistance."
- "Discard garlic skins, squeeze softened garlic from cloves."
- "In heavy saucepan, bring vegetable broth to gentle simmer. Add roasted tomatoes, shallots, garlic, and fresh tarragon stems."
- "Simmer uncovered 15 minutes, vegetables should fall apart easily, broth smelling herbaceous and rich."
- "Remove tarragon stems, transfer hot soup in batches to blender. Pulse briefly to keep some texture; avoid pureeing to total smoothness."
- "Return soup to pot, adjust thickness by adding stock if too thick. Taste for seasoning; add salt and pepper gradually."
- "Optional: stir in splash of coconut milk or cream for mellow sweetness and texture."
- "Serve hot with crusty bread. Garnish with chopped tarragon or drizzle olive oil if desired."
introduction: "Roasting tomatoes under intense heat bursts their natural sugars, turning them caramelized, dark, almost jammy but still bright. Past attempts with regular onions left too much sharpness, so shallots give a milder sweet edge. Garlic plays a subtle game—roasted whole, it softens to buttery spreadability rather than punchy raw pungency. Splitting the cooking stages—grill first, then simmer to meld—makes all difference. The smell swirling in the kitchen signals readiness long before clocks confirm. I swapped out chicken broth for vegetable to let the tomatoes shine brighter. Tarragon with its faint licorice whiff adds intrigue where basil felt expected. Never overblend. The texture that lingers on your lips—a bit rustic, a bit velveted—that’s where the magic hides. Might throw a splash of coconut milk if acidity bites too hard, learned that one the hard way."
ingredientsNote: "Beefsteak tomatoes ideal here; their fleshier body holds up to broiler heat and imparts the sweetness I'm after. You can sub plum tomatoes but expect a thinner soup. Shallots soften without overwhelming, replace with mild yellow onion if pressed. Garlic intensity is softened by roasting whole; minced garlic would scorch under open flame—know the difference, trust it. Smoked paprika swaps celery salt for a deep warmth that keeps the soup from tasting flat. Vegetable broth provides a neutral umami base, chicken stock is okay but masks brightness. Fresh tarragon is a subtle twist to lift from classic basil. If fresh is unavailable, use a pinch of dried but add early. Coconut milk balances acidity well, heavy cream makes it richer for fall or winter days. Olive oil quality matters—use good extra virgin, it carries through flavor layers. Salt and pepper added last after blending calibrate the final taste perfectly."
instructionsNote: "Heat intensity is everything roasting these vegetables. Too close or too long under broiler turns edges burnt bitter; too far or short, no caramelization, and the soup suffers lackluster sweetness. Listen for crackles and smell transformation—then pull out. Peeling warm tomatoes runs easier, don't force cooler skins. Simmer gently to soften, not boil furiously; aggressive boiling breaks down flavor and clarity. Blending in batches avoids overheating blender and quick purée can ruin texture. Slight chunkiness signals home-made character—skip ultra-smooth blender blitz. Adjust thickness with broth, too thick feels paste-like. Season gradually, taste after cooling a bit—hot temperatures dull seasoning senses. Adding tarragon late infuses fragrance without bitterness. Optional dairy alternative—stir slowly over low heat to prevent curdling or separation. Serve promptly but soup holds well refrigerated, flavor deepening overnight. Reheat gently; don't blast on high or risk flavor loss."
tips:
- "Roast tomatoes close to broiler, skin bubbles and chars in spots. Look for blistered skin pulling away easily. Smell shifts smoky sweet not burnt. Timing varies but 10 to 12 minutes typical. Cooler tomatoes resist peeling. Pull skin while warm, use fingers or knife edge gently."
- "Skip pureeing to baby-food smooth. Pulse blender in batches, keep some chunks for texture and mouthfeel. Too long blending kills rustic feel. Blend hot soup carefully, batches avoid overheating blender motor and temperature spike. Add broth to adjust thickness gradually, soup should coat spoon without stiffness."
- "Use smoked paprika instead of celery salt. Adds warmth without salt’s sharpness. Toss with olive oil and shallots before roasting for caramelization. Garlic roasted whole softens, squeezing out spreadable flesh. Minced garlic burns quickly under broiler, avoid it."
- "Fresh tarragon stems simmered infuse lightly, remove before blending to prevent bitter notes. Dried tarragon is okay but add early to extract flavor. Coconut milk tames acidity, heavy cream gives richer mouthfeel. Stir dairy in slowly on low heat to prevent separation or curdle."
- "Use quality extra virgin olive oil. Low-grade oil masks flavor layers, good oil carries through roasted aroma and fresh herbs. Salt and pepper added at end after blending calibrate seasoning precisely. Taste warm soup slowly; hot temps dull salt perception. Season gradually, adjust when cooled slightly."
faq:
- "q: Can chicken stock be used? a: Yes, but chicken stock adds fat and masks brightness. Vegetable broth cleaner. If using chicken, reduce or strain fat. Flavor shifts richer, less tomato focus."
- "q: How to know when tomatoes are ready? a: Skin should blister, bubble, blacken slightly. Smell turns smoky and sweet; crackling edges. Visual cues count more than clock. Timing differs based on tomato size and oven power."
- "q: What if soup is too acidic? a: Add splash coconut milk or cream. Both balance acidity. If no dairy, try small pinch sugar but avoid oversweet. Acid sharpness usually from tomato skin or cooking time; tweak roasting duration next time."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate covered few days max. Soup thickens; stir in broth when reheating if too dense. Freeze in portions, thaw overnight fridge. Reheat gently low heat. Avoid rapid temp changes spoiling texture."
