ingredients:
- "light dusting of all-purpose flour or chickpea flour"
- "2 pork filets, trimmed"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "270 ml (1 1/8 cup) chunky mango chutney, store-bought or homemade"
- "220 ml (7 1/2 fl oz) fresh orange juice, strained"
- "1 garlic clove, minced finely"
- "1 small rosemary sprig"
- "salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175 °C (347 °F)."
- "Pat pork filets dry. Lightly dust all sides with flour if surface sticky; prevents soggy crust."
- "Heat butter and oil over medium-high in ovenproof skillet. Wait for fat to shimmer; avoid burning butter."
- "Sear pork until golden on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Look for crust development and rattling sizzle."
- "Add garlic, rosemary, chutney, orange juice. Stir gently to deglaze pan, scraping fond with wooden spoon."
- "Bring sauce to lively boil, bubbling and thickening slightly."
- "Transfer skillet to oven; cook 18-22 minutes. Look for flesh turning opaque but still pinkish inside. Use finger press; firm but springy signals done."
- "Remove from oven and let rest 7 minutes under tented foil; juices redistribute for tender bite."
- "Slice pork medallions crosswise. Spoon chutney sauce over; serve alongside mashed potatoes or roasted sweet potatoes for earthiness."
introduction: "Ever struggled making pork moist and flavor-packed? Overcooked dry, or bland? Heard of pairing pork with something sweet but cautious? Mango chutney—yes. Tart, fruity, bursts of warmth with garlic and rosemary—this combo works wonders. Dust a little flour before searing; odd step at first but locks crust, seals juices. I tweaked butter and oil ratio over tries; butter alone burnt too quick, oil alone lacked flavor. Orange juice adds brightness and thins chutney for a saucier touch. Oven finishes gently, locking perfect rosy center. Resting crucial—don’t skip, trust me. The scent shifts from sharp garlic to mellow fruit and herb, aroma signals it’s coming together. Also, a touch of salt and fresh pepper elevates simple ingredients, makes the pork sing, not shout. Serve with creamy mash or sweeter tubers for contrast. Chunky chutney texture gives bite on tongue. Simple cooker tricks make difference between meh and wow."
ingredientsNote: "Flour coating keeps pork surface dry, helps caramelize; chickpea flour makes it gluten-free and adds subtle nutty touch. Butter-to-oil ratio balances flavor and smoke point—too much butter and pan blacks out. If no mango chutney, apricot preserves with chili flakes work as substitute, or pineapple with ginger for tropical spin. Fresh orange juice is key; canned often bitter. Rosemary gives piney background, subtle but critical. Garlic minced finely to avoid overpowering raw bite but release mellow aroma. Salt and pepper season meat properly before cooking; always taste sauce near end, chutney brands vary widely in sweetness and spice level, so adjust. If ovenproof skillet unavailable, transfer to baking dish but scrape down pan fond to retain flavor. Don’t skip resting pork after cooking; it firms slightly, holds juices where they belong. For lactose-intolerant, ensure butter is clarified or swap for ghee; oil alone too bland."
instructionsNote: "Heating butter and oil together lets you get rich flavor from butter without burning; watch closely. Butter foams then settles—a sign to add meat. Sear quickly on high heat; watch for deep golden crust, but avoid black char. Grinding fresh cracked pepper over meat post-sear enhances aroma but add salt early to draw flavor in meat. After adding chutney mixture, watch fond dissolve as sauce loosens; you want gentle bubble, not furious boil to avoid tough pork. Oven timing given as range; test with finger press or instant read thermometer (target 62-65 °C internal). Don’t stab pork repeatedly—juices leak out. Rest pork slices under tented foil to trap heat and let fibers relax. Thickened chutney sauce glistens, coats back of spoon; too thin means reduce a little longer on stovetop. If sauce too sweet, add splash lemon juice. Serve immediately with rustic mash—great counterpoint to tangy chutney notes. Small tricks: drying pork before flouring, controlling heat, proper rest—these make or break taste and texture."
tips:
- "Flour dusting key. Keeps surface dry; crust forms faster. Chickpea flour option for gluten-free adds subtle nutty notes. Don’t skip drying meat thoroughly first; sticky surface ruins crust attempt."
- "Butter and oil combo? Careful heating important. Butter foams, then calms—time to add pork before burnt taste. Too much butter, you black pan. Oil alone? Flavor less rich. Balance like I learned over trials."
- "Searing sounds guide you: Listen for sizzle, crust forming. 2-3 minutes per side generally, thicker cuts longer. Dark golden color okay but no black char. Flip gently; metal spatula can tear medallions."
- "Sauce bubbling but gentle boil needed to thicken. Furious boil toughens meat, breaks sauce texture. Scrape fond well with wooden spoon. Aroma shifts from sharp garlic spice to mellow fruity-herb mix—watch and smell closely."
- "Resting pork under foil crucial. Juices redistribute, fibers relax. Skip rest and juices run out on slicing—dry bites. Rest 7 minutes enough; don’t overdo or cool too much. Slice slightly across grain for tender mouthfeel."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute chutney? a: Apricot preserves with chili flakes can work. Pineapple ginger mix too, if you want tropical spin. Texture varies though, adjust liquid accordingly. Store-bought chutney sweetness varies vastly–taste early."
- "q: What if no ovenproof skillet? a: Transfer seared pork and sauce to baking dish. Scrape pan fond carefully to retain flavor. Use foil on dish if no lid. Oven time stable but watch internal temp to avoid dry meat."
- "q: How to tell doneness without thermometer? a: Finger press test works. Firm but springy feel signals medium with pinkish center. Scent also shifts. Listen for sauce bubbling changes. Avoid stabbing; juices leak and dry meat."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, cover airtight. Refrigerate 3-4 days max. Reheat gently in skillet or oven to preserve texture. Sauce thickens cold; add splash orange juice or water to loosen if needed."
