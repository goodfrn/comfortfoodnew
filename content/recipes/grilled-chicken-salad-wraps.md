ingredients:
- "60 ml (1/4 cup plus 1 tbsp) extra-virgin olive oil"
- "75 ml (5 tbsp) buttermilk"
- "20 ml (1 tbsp plus 1 tsp) Dijon mustard"
- "1 small shallot, roughly chopped"
- "1 clove garlic, crushed"
- "2 small dill pickles, chopped coarsely"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) sea salt"
- "450 g (1 lb) boneless, skinless chicken breast, halved horizontally"
- "100 g (3.5 cups) torn romaine lettuce"
- "100 g (2/3 cup) carrot sticks julienned"
- "2 Lebanese cucumbers, shaved thin on mandoline"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) mayonnaise"
- "20 g (2 tbsp) freshly grated Pecorino Romano"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) chopped fresh dill"
- "4 large wheat tortillas, approximately 23 cm (9 in) diameter"
instructions:
- "=== Mustard chicken marinade ==="
- "Pulse olive oil, buttermilk, mustard, shallot, garlic, pickles, and salt in blender until almost smooth but still a bit chunky. Taste—should hit balance of tangy, savory, creamy."
- "Put chicken in bowl. Reserve about half marinade for after grilling. Toss chicken with remaining marinade, cover, fridge minimum 6 hours, better overnight. The acid in buttermilk softens but don’t overdo or meat gets mushy."
- "=== Grilling the chicken ==="
- "Preheat grill to high heat. Oil grates well with tongs and paper towel dipped in oil to avoid sticking. Chicken comes off marinade, shake excess off but keep it moist."
- "Lay on grill. Listen—the sizzle should be sharp and steady. Wait 7-9 minutes turning once halfway when edges start drying and grill marks appear. Internal temp around 74C (165F) or juices run clear. Avoid poking meat too much or juices leak out."
- "Remove chicken. Let rest 5 minutes to redistribute juices, key step for tender pieces."
- "=== Assembling the wraps ==="
- "Slice chicken into thin 1 cm (1/2 inch) strips. Drop into large bowl."
- "Add reserved marinade (this wakes up the salad), lettuce, carrots, cucumber, mayo, cheese, and dill. Mix thoroughly. Taste—adjust salt or mayo if needed. Crisp textures balanced with creamy, tangy dressing."
- "Lay tortillas out. Mound salad in center. Fold edges tightly. Roll firm but don’t smash. Cut in half on a diagonal for presentation."
- "Wrap individually in parchment paper, twist ends like candy. Chill 20 minutes for flavors to marry or serve immediately."
- "=== Serving notes ==="
- "Great for lunchboxes or picnic on the go—stays fresh without wilting for hours. If no grill, a hot cast iron pan works too but lacks smoky notes. Substitute pickles with capers for a different vinegary kick. Pecorino Romano offers sharper bite over Parmesan but both work. Fresh herbs—dill is foundation here, don’t skip."
- "Use thicker tortillas to avoid tears. If tortilla feels dry, warm slightly under damp towel before assembling."
- "Experimented with Dijon levels; less mustard dulls, more can overpower. Balance is subtle but key."
introduction: "Chopped up chicken with tangy mustard marinate. Charred on hot grill till edges blacken, meat still juicy inside. Crunchy bits of lettuce, julienned carrots, and paper-thin cucumber ribbons tossed with creamy mayo and fresh shaved Pecorino. Dill adds fresh herbal punch. Tortillas soft but sturdy to hold everything tight. I’ve done this a hundred times. Sometimes marinade too sharp, or chicken dry. Learning to trust the sizzle, the smell, that quick flip—turn too soon, no grill marks; too late, dry meat. Wraps sliced and wrapped like parcels. Great cold or room temp. Lunches sorted. No nuts, just crisp, creamy, smoky, tangy, fresh all in one bite."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced mustard a bit from usual 2 tbsp to 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp to prevent overwhelming bitterness after marinating overnight. Switched Parmesan for Pecorino Romano—adds sharper salty edge, better contrast with sweet carrots and tart pickles. Pickles swapped from small cornichons to dill pickles; more bite and common pantry stand-in. Olive oil quality matters—extra-virgin for aroma but avoid overly grassy that shadows mustard. Buttermilk tenderizes chicken nicely, can substitute with diluted yogurt if none on hand. Always halve chicken breast horizontally for even cooking. Shaving cucumbers thin maximizes crunch and moisture but minimizes sogginess inside wrap. Eggs mayonnaise holds together filling sufficiently. Avoid bottled mayo with additives; homemade or quality store-bought gives best taste and creaminess. Fresh dill essential; dried won’t cut it here for brightness. Use fresh lemon zest in place of pickles if need twist for tang. Tortillas preferably wheat and pliable—store-bought store well but warm before rolling prevents cracking."
instructionsNote: "Start with pulsing marinade ingredients in blender—not too smooth, bits of pickles and shallot add texture and flavor bursts. Mixing marinade halves ensures intense flavor but not overpower chicken. Marinate minimum 6 hours but best overnight. Gravity pull for acid to soften meat gently, turning bowl halfway through prevents uneven marinate. Grill hot to lock moisture, oil grates well to avoid post-flip sticking, listen for sustaining sizzle as guide. Flip once, not constantly. Remove chicken as soon as juices clear and meat feels firm but springy. Resting key—under tented foil if needed. Slice uniformly for even bite size and better wrap rolling. Toss plated ingredients with reserved marinade to re-moisten and tie flavors together; add mayo and cheese last to avoid soggy mess. Adjust salt and pepper here, beware mayo dulls seasoning a bit. Wrap with care—lay filling off-center, fold sides first to trap filling, roll firm but gentle. Parchment wrap keeps shape and flavor, chill for 15-20 mins if time allows—allows juices to meld avoiding limp lettuce. If no grill, heavy skillet can sear but watch timing carefully and add smoked paprika to marinade for missing burnt flavor."
tips:
- "Marinate chicken minimum 6 hours; acid in buttermilk softens meat but keep under 12 hours or texture suffers. Reserve half marinade to toss with salad later for fresh punch. Pulsing ingredients gives chunky bits of shallot and pickles that add flavor bursts, don’t overblend."
- "Preheat grill high. Oil grates with paper towel gripped by tongs to avoid flare-ups. Listen for steady sizzle—not just noise but sound changes when meat is ready to flip. Wait for grill marks; flip once. Avoid poking meat to keep juices intact. Rest meat covered for 5 minutes; juice redistribution key for tenderness."
- "Cut chicken into uniform 1 cm strips for even texture. Toss filling ingredients with reserved marinade before adding mayo and cheese to avoid soggy salad. Use fresh dill only for brightness; dried herbs dull flavor and alter texture negatively. Cut wraps on diagonal for better presentation and easier eating."
- "Shave cucumbers paper-thin on mandoline—max crunch and moisture without sog. Julienned carrots keep fresh bite and color contrast. Switch pickles to capers if looking for sharper acid note. Olive oil quality matters; extra-virgin preferred but avoid grassy ones that hide mustard aroma."
- "If no grill, heavy skillet sears work but miss smoky notes. Add smoked paprika to marinade for smoky flavor. Tortillas should be pliable; warm slightly under damp towel if dry to prevent cracking when rolling. Wrap tight but avoid smashing filling; parchment wrap keeps shape and flavors sealed during chill."
faq:
- "q: How long to marinate chicken? a: At least six hours. Overnight better but not over 12 or meat gets mushy. Acid breaks down proteins slow. I do half marinade rescue for salad toss."
- "q: What if no grill? a: Use cast iron pan hot and fast. No smoke but you get sear. Then add smoked paprika to marinade for smoky kick. Watch timing closely to avoid drying."
- "q: How to keep wraps from soggy? a: Shave cucumber paper-thin, julienne carrots. Toss salad with reserved marinade first, mayo and cheese last. Chill wraps wrapped tight in parchment at least 15 mins. Lettuce stays crisp longer that way."
- "q: Store leftover wraps how? a: Wrap in parchment, fridge up to a day. If longer, separate salad and chicken, hold tortillas separate. Tortillas get dry but rewarm in damp towel before rolling. Flavors better next day but texture shifts."
