ingredients:
- "300 ml (1 ¼ cup) spelt flour"
- "4 ml (¾ tsp) baking soda"
- "150 ml (⅔ cup) plain Greek yogurt"
- "1 lemon, zest grated"
- "25 ml (1 ½ tbsp) fresh lemon juice"
- "100 ml (7 tbsp) softened unsalted butter"
- "200 ml (⅞ cup) granulated sugar"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) honey"
- "2 whole eggs"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) vanilla extract"
- "2 ml (½ tsp) ground cardamom"
- "=== Glaze (optional) ==="
- "200 ml (¾ cup) plain Greek yogurt"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) icing sugar"
- "1 lime, zest grated"
- "20 ml (1 ½ tbsp) lime juice"
instructions:
- "Move oven rack center. Heat oven to 175 C (345 F). Grease and line 22 x 12 cm (8 ½ x 4 ½ inch) loaf pan with parchment paper."
- "Blend together spelt flour, baking soda, cardamom in a medium bowl. Set aside."
- "Mix yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice, and vanilla in a separate small bowl until uniform."
- "In another large bowl, beat butter with sugar and honey until creamy. Add eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. Ignore the urge to rush."
- "Shift dry ingredients into butter mix gradually; alternate with yogurt mix. Stir until just combined. Avoid overmixing or dense."
- "Spoon batter evenly into loaf pan. Smooth surface with spatula. Set timer for 40 minutes; bake until wooden skewer poked in middle comes out clean with moist crumbs attached."
- "Take out oven, let cool in pan 10 minutes. Then lift cake from pan using parchment edges. Cool completely on wire rack before applying glaze or slicing."
- "=== Glaze === Whisk Greek yogurt, icing sugar, lime zest, and juice until creamy and spreadable. Dollop or thinly spread over cooled loaf. Tiny tang variation with lime replaces lemon topping."
- "Cut into thick slices. Serve plain or with glaze. Store wrapped at room temperature up to two days or chilled for four."
introduction: "Lemon, yogurt, spelt flour, honey, cardamom. No timer perfect. Shifts in sugar and baking time. Vanilla sneaking in. Tangy lime glaze. The texture roughly crumbly but moist inside. Bright zest notes. Loaf shape, rustic edges cracked here and there. Mix dry with wet parts. Whisk vigorously or slow. Eggs in one by one, rhythm matter. Oven hot and breathing warmth. Wait for toothpick test. Remove, cool. Glaze or no? Citrus swap. Tang sharp with lime. Slice thick. Eat neat. Breakfast, snack, dessert halfway. Day changes flavor. Spelt adds noisier grain funk. Honey smooths edges. Cardamom quiet but audible. Notes on a lemon theme but unexpected. Simple steps with subtle twists. Humble cake but different. Not just lemon, but warming cardamom and lime. Substitutions to dull sugar rush, add depth. Slightly shorter bake time trims dryness risk. Pale yellow crumb with flecks of zest. Texture like mild crumbly sponge, enough moistness thanks to yogurt."
ingredientsNote: "Spelt flour instead of all-purpose gives heartier, nuttier flavor, absorbs liquids differently. Measure carefully, can be denser. Bicarbonate still lifts cake, but less than baking powder. Honey added partly to sweeten but cut unrefined. Keeps moisture good, slows sugar-only harshness. Butter softened, not melted, key to creamy creaming with sugar. Greek yogurt used for moisture and tang, consistent sourness. Lemon zest and juice induce fresh zing but not overpowering. Vanilla extract adds background warmth. Cardamom tiny but perceptible, natural spice balance. Eggs bind, add richness. For glaze, lime replaces lemon to vary citrus note, sugar dusted down for softness. Yogurt glaze thinner than cream cheese, cleaner lines. Optional but recommended for more taste contrast. Adjust glaze thickness by sugar amount. Overall, ingredients chosen to tweak sweet, tang, and moisture balance. Substitutions mindful to keep tang and lightness while adding complexity and less sugar impulse."
instructionsNote: "Preheat matters, air circulation center rack ensures even heat. Loaf pan size adjusts baking time slightly shorter by 5 minutes. Butter and sugar must be creamed fully until fluffy; skipping leads to dense crumb. Add eggs slowly to avoid mixture breaking or curdling. Alternating dry and wet helps distribute flour evenly, prevents overdoing one. Stop mixing soon after combined to keep crumb tender. Smooth batter into pan without compacting to avoid heaviness. Toothpick test crucial, test earlier than usual to avoid overbaking vapor loss. Cooling in pan first stabilizes shape, then removal avoids soggy bottom. Room temp cooling promotes uniform texture. Apply glaze only once fully cooled to prevent melting and runny pooling. Whisk glaze thoroughly to uniform, avoid lumps. Spread thin or dollop for rustic look or neat sheen, personal choice. Cake slices well after glaze set to prevent smearing. Store covered, avoid drying, bread box or sealed container suggested. Best eaten within two days room temp or up to four refrigerated. Slight warming revives crumb moistness next day."
tips:
- "Oven preheating vital. Always center rack. Ensures even heat distribution. Bake too hot risks burning. Too cool? Underbaked, wet cake."
- "Butter must be softened, room temp. Not melted. Creaming should be fluffy. Sugar needs time to mix well. Dense texture happens otherwise."
- "Eggs added one at a time. Mixing thoroughly each time. Breakage? Curdled batter means bad texture. Hesitate not when mixing."
- "Glaze optional but enhances flavor. Lime instead of lemon creates contrast. Adjust sugar for thickness. Thin application looks neat."
- "Careful with spelt flour. Heavier absorption than all-purpose. Measure accurately for balance. Dense loaves spoil fluffy texture."
- "Toothpick test crucial. Check earlier than usual. Overbaking loses moisture. Don’t delay cooling in the pan too long. Shape matters."
faq:
- "q: Can I use regular flour? a: Yes but texture changes. All-purpose lighter. Might need extra liquid. Adjust recipe carefully."
- "q: What if my loaf is too dense? a: Check butter creaming. Eggs incorporated well? Overmixing adds weight. Mix till combined only."
- "q: How do I store it? a: Cover tightly at room temp under two days. Refrigerate for up to four days. No drying out."
- "q: Can I skip the glaze? a: Yes, that's fine. Cake still flavorful alone. Consider yogurt for moisture. Glaze adds zing but isn't mandatory."
