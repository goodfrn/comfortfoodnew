ingredients:
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 medium onion, diced"
- "4 cloves garlic, minced"
- "1.25 pounds ground beef"
- "3/4 cup stout beer (or dark ale)"
- "2 tablespoons tomato paste"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard"
- "2 medium carrots, finely chopped"
- "1 tablespoon brown sugar"
- "2 teaspoons chili powder"
- "3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper"
- "1 teaspoon ground black pepper"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 teaspoon ground cumin"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When oil shimmers, toss in diced onion. Stir occasionally. Look for edges turning translucent and flesh softening, about 6-7 minutes. No browning yet, just sweat the onions till silky."
- "Add garlic once onions are soft. Keep stirring. Garlic releases aroma quickly—2-3 minutes is enough. Watch for golden edges, don’t burn. Garlic turning bitter ruins this stage."
- "Drop in ground beef, break apart immediately with wooden spoon or spatula. Season lightly with salt at this point to draw out moisture. Medium-high heat to brown beef, don’t stir nonstop—let crust form. Around 6-7 minutes. Visual cue: rich brown crust, pockets of fat rendering out, juicy smell. Too much stirring? No crust, mushy beef."
- "Pour in stout beer. Hear that hiss? That’s flavor lifting off fat and sticking bits. Scrape bottom to get all brown bits incorporated—that’s umami gold. Stir to mix liquid with meat evenly."
- "Spoon in tomato paste, add mustard, sprinkle in brown sugar. Stir to distribute evenly. Carrots go in now, their texture is important—little bits soften without disappearing. Mix spices (chili powder, cayenne, black pepper, cumin) directly into pot. Adjust cayenne down if prone to burning nose, or up for fiery punch."
- "Turn heat to low. Cover partially—lid ajar to avoid watering down. Simmer 25-30 minutes. Stir every 5 minutes or when edges start sticking. Consistency should thicken, gravy-like with oil floating a bit on top as sign of done. Smell deepens, sweetness balancing heat. If too thick, add splash of water or more beer; too thin, cook a bit longer uncovered."
- "Taste test. Salt always needs tweaking at end. Add in small amounts, mix well before deciding. If too tangy, pinch sugar. If flat, more pepper or mustard."
- "Serve hot, with bread or over rice. Can double and freeze well. Reheat gently with splash of broth if dry."
introduction: "Start with onions. Soft but no color. Garlic next oils up quickly. Ground beef deserves some crust, don’t stir like crazy. Brown beef builds the flavor base. Beer isn’t just booze; it pulls crust bits loose, lifts flavors. Tomato paste, mustard, brown sugar - this trio hits sweet, tang, and funk right. Cook low and slow, stirring just enough to keep pot from sticking. Carrots aren’t filler but subtle sweet moments. I’ve burnt the garlic too often, so watch it. The smell shifting from raw onion to spicy beef is the signal; you’re on track. Salt last, always. Too much early kills the moisture and dulls depth. Adjust spice to your mood; it’s forgiving but needs respect."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil’s the jump-off point. Avoid cheap brands that smoke at medium heat; your pan will thank you with less sticking. Onions should be diced into small pieces—not pulverized—to give texture contrast in finished chili. Fresh garlic minced fine, not crushed, for even cook. Ground beef? Go with 85% lean for fat that browns well but isn’t greasy. Stout beer adds bitterness but use dark ale if you have no stout; avoid light beers, flavor won’t develop. Tomato paste’s acidity pulls everything together; no canned tomatoes here—they dilute. Mustard for tang but swap Dijon with yellow mustard if short, less sharp but picks up sweetness. Brown sugar—not white—adds molasses notes. Carrots chopped fine or grated work. Spices measured but taste buds will dictate; cayenne’s punch can be deadly. Always have salt and pepper at hand for seasoning adjustments later."
instructionsNote: "Heat your pot first, then oil—oil should ripple once hot. The difference between sweating and softening onions is moisture loss; keep stirring to avoid burn, but allow edges to slightly caramelize for depth. Adding garlic too soon or cooking it too long will ruin aroma. Ground beef needs patience: let that CRUST form—don’t stir constantly. A stubborn stuck bottom isn’t failure; deglaze with beer to lift concentrated flavor bits. Tomato paste should coat beef evenly. Spice timing matters; throw them in before simmering so flavors bloom but don’t scorch. Partial lid on during simmer keeps liquid balanced—steam escapes, flavors condense. Stir periodically to avoid scorching, scraping sides for flavor integration. Use visual cues: sauce thickens, oil rises to top, aroma intensifies. If consistency still too runny, simmer uncovered few extra minutes. Taste constantly at end. Salt enhances flavors but can kill balance if overdone."
tips:
- "Heat oil till it shimmers, not smokes, olive oil quality matters here. Toss in diced onions small but not mushy. Sweat slow. Watch edges go translucent but no browning yet. That crisp base means sweat, not roast. Garlic comes after onions soften. Too soon smells bitter."
- "When adding ground beef, push it flat first, let brown crust form without stirring nonstop. Crust means flavor pockets. Stir too much and it steams, no crust. Salt early helps moisture extraction but light or you'll dry meat fast. Timing here is everything—six to seven minutes browning."
- "Stout beer—dark ale works too—not lager or pilsner, too light. Pour and scrape the pan bottom to lift browned bits. That hiss and sizzle? Flavor uncoiling. Tomato paste and mustard go right after, stir to coat meat in color and tang. Brown sugar calms heat while carrots add soft-sweet texture."
- "Spices are thrown in pre-simmer—not too early or burnt. Chili powder, cayenne, black pepper, cumin combine. Adjust cayenne carefully. Keep lid slightly ajar to let steam escape without watering down. Stir every five minutes, check edges for sticking. Consistency thickens slowly, like gravy but with oil rising on top."
- "Final seasoning needs constant tasting. Salt last always—too early dulls flavor, kills moisture. If it’s too sharp, pinch extra sugar; flat calls for more mustard or pepper. If chili too thick, add splash water or extra beer. Over-thick? Simmer uncovered a bit longer. Texture and smell tell timing better than clock."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent garlic from burning? a: Wait till onions soft. Garlic cooks fast—two, maybe three minutes maximum. Watch color closely, brown means bitter taste. Stir gently but often. Toss it in once onions sweat well but not yet browned."
- "q: Can I skip beer? a: Yeah. Use beef broth instead plus a tablespoon vinegar—cuts similar acidity and tang. Avoid light beers that lack depth. Dark ale closest if stout unavailable. Broth won’t give crust lift but workable if no stout around."
- "q: What if chili sticks to bottom? a: Lower heat first. Scrape bottom carefully with wooden spoon. Sticking bits add flavor if not burned. Deglaze with beer or water right away. High heat burns taste fast. Patience beats rushing here."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container up to four days. Freeze in portions, thaw overnight in fridge. Reheat gently with splash broth or water to loosen dry spots. Avoid microwave overheat or chili dries and toughens."
