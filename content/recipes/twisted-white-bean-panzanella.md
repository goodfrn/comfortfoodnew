ingredients:
- "6 slices pancetta"
- "480 g (3 1/2 cups) grape tomatoes"
- "2 cloves garlic peeled"
- "75 ml (5 c. tbsp) olive oil"
- "200 g (7 cups) country bread cut into cubes"
- "25 ml (2 tbsp) white balsamic vinegar"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) honey"
- "1 can 400 ml (14 oz) white beans rinsed drained"
- "120 g (5 cups) arugula"
- "Fresh thyme leaves 1 tbsp"
- "Ricotta cheese optional"
- "Salt and pepper"
instructions:
- "1. Start: oven at 215°C (420°F). Two pans lined parchment paper. Pancetta slices on one; grape tomatoes spread on the other."
- "2. Roast both pans simultaneously 22 minutes till pancetta crispy and tomatoes soft, wrinkled. Cool briefly. Rough chop pancetta."
- "3. Meanwhile, warm a large skillet over medium-high. Pour in 50 ml olive oil and crush 1 clove garlic lightly; fry garlic until golden."
- "4. Toss bread cubes in skillet. Stir, let cubes toast golden all around, adding more oil if they stick. Sprinkle salt."
- "5. Remove garlic cloves. Mince soft garlic finely. In a big bowl combine minced garlic, white balsamic vinegar, honey, remaining olive oil."
- "6. Add roasted tomatoes, white beans, sprinkle fresh thyme leaves, season with salt and pepper. Toss to blend flavors."
- "7. Just before serving, fold in arugula, crispy pancetta, toasted bread cubes. Adjust salt pepper. Dollop ricotta on top if wanted."
introduction: "Bread, beans, meat, fire. Crunch meets softness. Grape tomatoes roasting, juices bubbling, skins wrinkling fast. Pancetta shrinks, crackling. Garlic sizzles in olive oil, fragrance thick, filling kitchen. Toss cubes of bread in the hot oil, browning, sticky wanting more time. Dressing sharp and sweet—white balsamic flashes hit honey’s mellow hum. Combining textures, flavors—leafy arugula cuts through rich pancetta oils. Ricotta quenelle optional; creamy smooth relief. Variations only add the charm. Simple but filled with things to catch the tongue. Timed roasting close but a little off, makes all difference; keep watch. Big bowl holds it all, tossing fast, brutal even. Serve slightly warm or cool, that’s preferred. Rustic feels. Remnants of the pans on the counter promising seconds."
ingredientsNote: "Pancetta traded in for bacon changes the flavor profile to something more delicate but equally savory with a bit more chew. Grape tomatoes swap for cherry tomatoes for a subtler sweetness and evenly small size. White balsamic vinegar replaces white wine vinegar for a less acidic but floral punch supporting the honey’s sweetness. Garlic crushed whole and fried then minced preserves gentle aroma without burning bitter. Bread is important; use sturdy country loaf or miche cut into uneven chunks to soak dressing while still holding texture after toasting. Fresh thyme adds an earthy aromatic layer instead of something heavier like rosemary, fitting the lighter beans and roasted tomatoes better. Arugula balances richness with peppery bite and fresh crunch. Ricotta cheese remains optional to top salad with creamy brightness but can be left out for dairy-free. Salt and pepper crucial for lifting all components; season gradually and taste before serving."
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven high, close to 215°C. Use two baking sheets for roasting pancetta and tomatoes separately for even cooking and separate textures. Pancetta needs to crisp and shrivel; tomatoes soften and blister but keep shape. Stir frequently during toasting bread cubes in olive oil, starting with whole garlic cloves to infuse oil without burnt garlic bitterness. Remove garlic before adding dressing ingredients. Mince roasted garlic for a punch of mellow flavor folded in raw with the dressing. Mix in vinegar and honey incrementally to balance acidity versus sweetness. Add fresh herbs last to keep aroma bright, add arugula and pancetta only just before serving to retain their textures. Toss salad quickly but thoroughly, check seasoning at each stage. Serve immediately or slightly warm; bread loses texture if left too long so best eaten shortly after tossing. Optionally, use ricotta quenelle spooned on top to provide creamy textural counterpoint. Timing is key, keep a close eye on roasting and toasting times, adjusting ±3-5 minutes to oven variances."
tips:
- "Choosing bread matters. Country loaves work best. Sturdy texture holds dressing. Cut uneven chunks. They soak up flavor but stay crispy."
- "Roast pancetta and tomatoes separately. This is key. Ensure pancetta crisps, tomatoes soften without falling apart. Timing can vary. Keep watch."
- "Garlic is powerful. Whole cloves fried in oil infuse flavor. Remove before adding dressing. Mince roasted garlic for a soft, mellow punch."
- "Season gradually. Start with salt while toasting bread. Add pepper later in the mixing. Always taste before serving. Adjust where needed."
- "Served warm or cool, but timing impacts texture. Bread can turn soggy if left too long. Best eaten shortly after tossing together."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Refrigerate up to two days. Bread may stale. Try reheating in oven. Or eat cold."
- "q: Can I use different beans? a: Yes, any white beans work. Cannellini, navy beans, even chickpeas fit. Each offers unique texture and flavor."
- "q: What if I can’t find pancetta? a: Alternatives included. Bacon can be used. Turkey bacon is lighter. Adjust cooking times as needed."
- "q: What can I add to make it heartier? a: Consider grilled chicken, shrimp. Quinoa adds protein. Cheese, like feta, also boosts flavor and depth."
