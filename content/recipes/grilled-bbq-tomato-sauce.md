slug: "grilled-bbq-tomato-sauce"
description: "Roasting tomatoes on the grill chars the skin, deepening flavor. This sauce blends smoky, sweet, tart notes enhanced by fresh basil and subtle laurel. Uses plum-style tomatoes though Roma or San Marzano works too. Slow simmer breaks down fibers; transforms the mix into a rustic, thick sauce. A good hit of olive oil brings richness and mouthfeel. Onions and garlic sweat first to layer savory depth. Peeling off charred skins and squeezing seeds out prevents bitterness and grainy texture. Basil comes in at the end to keep its brightness intact. Easily vegan, gluten-free, and adaptable. Great with pasta or as base for stews and meats. Hands-on prep, but rewarding. Alternatives include grilling peppers or adding a splash of balsamic for complexity. Watch for overcooking—they can ferment or turn grainy if neglected. Must stir. Ideal summer recipe when tomatoes are ripe and grill fired up."

ingredients:
- "6.5 kg plum tomatoes halved lengthwise"
- "170 ml extra virgin olive oil"
- "3 medium yellow onions finely chopped"
- "4 cloves garlic minced"
- "2 dried bay leaves"
- "12 g fresh basil leaves thinly sliced"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Set grill to high heat; make sure grates clean and oiled to avoid sticking."
- "Toss tomatoes in 140 ml olive oil, salt, and pepper till evenly coated."
- "Arrange tomato halves cut-side down in one single layer over the grill; you want that blistered skin crackle, about 4-6 minutes. Look for edges caramelizing and some charring spots."
- "Flip carefully; grill another 4-5 minutes until skin loosened and flesh softened. Remove with spatula; place on baking sheet to cool enough to handle."
- "Peel off charred skins by hand; don't rush here or you'll lose sauce quality. Then gently squeeze each tomato half to push out seeds—this avoids bitter watery finish."
- "Coarsely mash peeled tomatoes with hands or potato masher into chunky pulp; no blender, texture matters."
- "In large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm remaining 30 ml olive oil. Add onions and garlic; sweat slowly until translucent and soft, about 7 minutes. Avoid browning or it takes a bitter turn."
- "Add mashed tomatoes and bay leaves. Bring to low boil, then reduce to medium-low to maintain gentle steady simmer. Stir every 10 minutes to prevent sticking and watch sauce thicken."
- "Simmer uncovered for approximately 2 hours—texture should be thick but not dry. Skin bits dissolve; sauce glistens slightly and smells deeply sweet and smoky. Taste for salt, add pepper. Stir in basil last 5 minutes to preserve aroma and green vibrancy."
- "Remove bay leaves before serving. Ideal spooned straight on hot pasta or dolloped over veal scaloppine. Also works chilled as condiment or folded with roasted veggies."
- "Leftovers refrigerate up to 4 days or freeze in airtight container. When reheating, warm slowly to avoid breaking."
- "TIP Substitute up to 20% of tomatoes with red bell peppers grilled the same way; adds subtle sweetness and complexity."
- "If tomatoes seem watery during simmer, increase heat briefly but watch closely to avoid burning; consistency is key. If sauce too thick, splash in reserved tomato juice or water."
- "Peeling is a chore but worth for silky mouthfeel. If rushed, skins can muddy taste and texture."
- "You’ll know sauce is done when spoonful shows vibrant deep red, coats back thickly, and is glossy—not dull or separated."
introduction: "Grilling tomatoes isn't just summer fun, it unlocks smoky depth you won't get roasting under a broiler. The charred skin cracks, sugars hit a smoky high, acidity softens, all making the sauce richer without heaviness. Tried raw tomatoes simmered directly; flat and harsh. Grilled gives complexity, almost meaty. The slow simmer after is about patience and coaxing flavor. Watch out, too much heat ruins it—burnt bits bitter, dull color. Peeling is annoying but critical—stays rustic, never gritty or bitter. Basil added late keeps herbal brightness meanwhile bay leaves add slight earthiness. The texture? Chunky, thick, full mouthfeel. This sauce rewards hands-in cooking, time, but better than canned, no preservatives. Tried this first roasting whole on tray; result too wet and bland. Now grilling breaks down fibers nicely, intensifies aroma. Olive oil is last note, silkiness in spoonful. Don't skip sweating onions and garlic; base flavor builds here. Give it time, stir—it’s worth the wait."
ingredientsNote: "Tomatoes: Italy’s plum or Roma-type preferred for flesh density and fewer seeds. Always halve lengthwise to expose juicy interior to grill fire for proper char and quick roasting. Substituting 1-2 kg with red bell pepper grilled same way amps sweetness and color. Onion and garlic need gentle heat to avoid caramelized bitterness but melt into base flavor. Olive oil choice matters; extra virgin for finishing silkiness but neutral oil can replace in cooking base if you’re budget-minded. Fresh basil brings bright, almost peppery green finish—add very late, avoid dulling with heat. Bay leaves contribute subtle earth tone, but dried or fresh both fine. Salt and black pepper essential, but adjust after simmer; flavors concentrate. Peeling tomatoes is tedious but prevents gritty texture often overlooked. If in hurry, plunge peeled tomatoes in ice water to loosen skin faster but removes some smoke aroma. This sauce is vegan, gluten-free, and free of nuts, dairy, eggs. Try adding a splash of dry white wine in simmer for acidity twist or pinch of chili flakes if you like heat; complements smoky notes well."
instructionsNote: "Grill prep critical—hot hot grates prevent sticking and ensure blistering, not steaming. Oil tomatoes well; oil acts heat bridge and flavor carrier. Timing on grill flexible—look for crackling skin, slight black spots. Flip gently with spatula to keep flesh intact. Removing skin isn’t a fluff step; skins charred and bitter can ruin batch. Squeeze seed gel out—too much moisture ruins sauce texture. Mashing by hand allows control over chunk size—resist blender temptation for rustic sauce. Sweating onions and garlic low and slow means flavor base, no bitterness or burnt smell. Simmer uncovered on medium-low; too low won’t thicken, too high scorches. Stirring essential; sauce sticks and burns easily. Time guide 1:50-2:10 hours, but trust sight/smell more. Don’t rush basil addition; heat kills freshness and color instantly. Final sauce should coat spoon thickly but shine gloss. Season last. Bay leaves must be removed or sauce tastes woody. Saves well, reheats better slowly to keep texture. Bonus: a splash of reserved tomato juice thins too thick sauce without dulling flavor. Avoid canned tomatoes here; fresh grill magic can’t be replicated."
tips:
- "Grill grates must be super clean and hot. Oil tomatoes thoroughly before placing cut-side down. Look for skin crackling; black spots here and there ok. Timing varies by grill temp. Flip gently with spatula to keep tomato halves intact. Too rough and pulp breaks, messes texture."
- "Peeling charred skins is crucial. Rushing leads to bitter, gritty sauce. Squeeze seeds out carefully — seed gel is watery and bitter, ruins thick texture. If pressed for time, an ice water bath loosens skin quickly but some smoky aroma lost."
- "Sweat onions and garlic slow on medium-low. Color stay pale soft. Any browning means bitter taste undercuts sauce sweetness. Use heavy pot to avoid scorching while simmering. Stir frequently, sauce sticks easily despite gentle heat so watch timing carefully."
- "Add basil only last minutes — early addition kills bright green color and fresh peppery aroma. Bay leaves can stay longer for subtle earth tone but remove before serving or woody flavor emerges. Salt near end; flavors concentrate after hours simmer."
- "If sauce gets watery during simmer, turn heat up briefly; evaporates moisture fast but watch closely not to scorch. If too thick at end, splash reserved tomato juice or water — balancing thickness without dulling glossy shine. Stirring keeps sauce uniform."
faq:
- "q: How long do I grill tomatoes? a: Usually 4-6 minutes cut-side down till skins blister crackle. Flip 4-5 more minutes. Watch edges for caramelize spots. Grills vary so timing’s guide, not rule. Too long risks bitterness."
- "q: Can I skip peeling skins? a: Peeling removes bitter char that ruins smooth rustic texture. Skins charred on grill break down grainy, bitter. For texture control and flavor clarity peel off as soon as cooled. Alternative: roast whole but sauce wetter, less smoky."
- "q: Sauce too watery after simmer? a: Turn heat up briefly, stir to evaporate excess liquid. Avoid lid on so moisture escapes. If still thin, add splash reserved tomato juice to thin but keep flavor. Thickening happens after 1.5-2 hours usually."
- "q: How store leftover sauce? a: Fridge up to 4 days air-tight container. Freeze ok but thaw gently to avoid separation. Reheat slow, don’t boil hard or oil breaks. For quick use, portion before freezing avoids reheating whole batch multiple times."
