- "4 large eggs"
- "430 g (3 1/4 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "75 g (1/3 cup) granulated sugar"
- "8 ml (1 2/3 tsp) instant yeast"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) salt"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) ground cardamom"
- "180 g (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, cubed and softened for 10 minutes"
- "130 g (3/4 cup) golden raisins"
- "120 g (2/3 cup) chopped dried dates"
- "=== Glaze ==="
- "100 g (3/4 cup) powdered sugar"
- "20 ml (4 tsp) whole milk"
instructions:
- "=== Brioche ==="
- "1. Prepare a 30 x 22 cm (12 x 8 1/2 in) rectangular pan. Butter it and line with parchment, letting edges hang over sides for easy removal. Set aside."
- "2. In a bowl, whisk together milk and eggs. Set aside."
- "3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and cardamom. Mix briefly."
- "4. Add liquid mixture all at once. Mix on medium speed until dough starts forming. Gradually add softened butter cubes, continuing to knead about 7 minutes until elastic and shiny."
- "5. Turn dough onto floured surface. Gently knead in raisins and chopped dates about 2 minutes until evenly distributed."
- "6. Divide dough into 10 equal pieces. Shape each into smooth balls by rolling under palm on lightly floured surface."
- "7. Arrange balls in prepared pan, spacing slightly. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temp 2 to 2.5 hours until nearly doubled, dough pieces touching."
- "8. Set oven rack in middle. Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F)."
- "9. Lightly brush tops with water to help crust color."
- "10. Bake for 28 to 30 minutes until deep golden brown. Cool in pan 15 minutes."
- "=== Glaze ==="
- "11. Whisk powdered sugar and milk until smooth consistency."
- "12. Transfer glaze to a piping bag with small plain tip. Pipe a cross shape atop each bun."
- "13. Serve warm or at room temp, optionally with butter."
introduction: "Lenten brioche. No nuts. Raisins and dates swap apricots. Cardamom instead of cinnamon. Warm milk and eggs mixed then added to dry ingredients. Yeast activated quickly. Butter blended in slowly makes dough supple, rich. Dough rested until doubled. Patience needed for rise. Then shaped into 10 dough balls, spaced with room to expand. Cross piped atop buns with glaze made from powdered sugar and milk. Baked slower at 190°C for longer. Crust thicker, not burnt. Cooling brings flavors out. Texture soft, airy. Sticky glaze sweetens. Serve with butter for richness. Ideal for brunch or tea time. No nuts, safe for sensitive eaters. Dates add chewy texture, natural sweetness. Cardamom adds gentle warmth, subtle spice. Instead of traditional cinnamon. Variation for those seeking twist. Mixing times adjusted for dough hydration. Resting increased slightly. Baking times extended to perfect crumb and color balance."
ingredientsNote: "Butter softened but not melted. Essential for dough texture, richness. Warm milk activates yeast without killing it. Eggs add moisture and structure. Flour measured by weight for accuracy; slight reduction compensates for added dried fruit moisture. Sugar amount cut slightly for balanced sweetness. Using cardamom instead of cinnamon freshens profile, complements dates well. Raisins soaked briefly in warm water if very dry to plump. Dates chopped small to distribute evenly and avoid large dense spots. Salt balances yeast and sweetness. Yeast instant type used for convenience, faster rise. Glaze thick enough to hold shape but fluid enough to pipe smoothly. Adjust milk quantity slightly for perfect piping consistency. Baking pan lined with parchment prevents sticking, lifts buns without damage."
instructionsNote: "Mixing starts with dry ingredients for even yeast distribution. Liquids added whole to hydrate flour uniformly. Butter added gradually while mixing to ensure proper emulsification. Kneading times increased to develop gluten, compensate for fat content. Final knead with fruit incorporated gently to avoid crushing. Divide dough into equal portions for uniform cooking. Shaping by rolling provides surface tension for rise and oven spring. Cover with plastic prevents crust drying during proof. Proofing room temperature steady; avoid drafts. Brushing water before baking encourages browning. Oven temperature lowered from original to avoid burnt crust with added sugar from fruit. Baking time stretched to ensure baked centers. Cooling brief but important before glazing to prevent melting. Glaze prepared fresh, piped in cross motif adds symbolic touch as well as shiny finish. Serve with or without butter for personal preference."
tips:
- "For best results, use warm milk. Activates yeast properly. It helps dough rise. Follow timings. Knead long enough until shiny."
- "Butter can’t be melted. Use cubed, softened butter. Gradually mix into dough. This enriches texture. Keeps sweetness balanced. Don't rush this."
- "Plump raisins? Soak in warm water for a bit. Helps distribute moisture. Prevents drying out in baking. Dates make it chewy. Chop small!"
- "Dough needs space. Each bun should touch lightly. Too crowded means less rise. Cover with plastic wrap. Stop crust forming as it rises."
- "Oven temp matters. Preheat well. Bake longer if needed. Check for color. Golden is good. Cool slightly before glazing for best texture."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Yes, swap raisins for other dried fruits. But adjust sweetness. Also, try different spices. Cardamom is nice."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Place in airtight container. At room temp. Keeps softness a bit longer. Can freeze, then reheat easily."
- "q: What if bun centers are doughy? a: Ensure even baking next time. Lower temperature slightly but increase time. Monitor closely."
- "q: Can I make dough ahead? a: Prepare and refrigerate. Shape after chilling. Rise time increases in fridge. Adjust baking time as needed."
