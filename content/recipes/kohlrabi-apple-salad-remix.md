ingredients:
- "1 kohlrabi, peeled and thinly sliced on a mandoline"
- "45 ml lemon juice (3 tbsp)"
- "0.5 ml salt (1/8 tsp)"
- "1 pear, cored and diced small"
- "60 g frisée or bitter greens (2 cups packed)"
- "70 g fresh figs, halved"
- "30 g Manchego cheese shavings (1/4 cup)"
- "1 small plum, cut into thin wedges"
- "20 ml olive oil"
- "10 ml walnut oil"
- "15 ml apple cider vinegar"
instructions:
- "Start by layering kohlrabi slices in a bowl. Toss with lemon juice and salt; massaging slightly to wake up the veggies. Let sit about 10 to 12 minutes, until edges soften but crisp remains."
- "While kohlrabi is doing its thing, dice pear into neat small cubes. Toss gently with remaining lemon juice to stop browning; drain excess juice if any pools."
- "Drain liquid off kohlrabi; add to pear. Now fold in frisée, figs, and plum wedges carefully, keeping as much shape and crunch intact."
- "Whisk olive oil, walnut oil, and apple cider vinegar; drizzle over salad. Finish by scattering Manchego shavings. Taste and adjust salt if needed. Serve immediately for freshest texture."
- "Watch the kohlrabi for slight translucence but no sogginess before draining; this ensures crisp but not raw bite. Avoid overdressing which wilts greens and dulls bright fruit flavors."
introduction: "Crunch hits sharper here. Knew I had to ditch apple for something juicier yet less acidic — pear. Suddenly a soak in lemon juice doesn’t just preserve but teases out sweetness. Kohlrabi needs that gentle massage; no brute force or it turns limp. Figs came as a happy accident; their deeper earthiness cuts through the bright. Frisée instead of arugula adds a slight bitterness with crunch you don’t expect. Manchego’s a personal favorite twist—richer than pecorino, playful texture. Plum wedges thrown in last for a sweet tang burst between bites. Dressing’s heavier on oils, walnut oil imparting an almost nutty aroma without actual nuts—raises the bar, trust me. Timing is everything; too long and it’s mush, too little and the kohlrabi tastes raw. I eyeball translucence before any draining. Texture contrast: that’s the goal here."
ingredientsNote: "Mandoline slicing is a game changer; uniform thin slices marry flavor and mouthfeel consistently. Substitute pear with crisp apple variety like Honeycrisp if unavailable, but reduce lemon juice to avoid overpowering acidity. Frisée can be swapped with dandelion greens for more bitterness or romaine if subtlety preferred. Fresh figs replaced with halved seedless grapes or chopped dried apricots for falloffs in season. Walnut oil can be replaced with hazelnut or toasted sesame oil for different aroma profiles; olive oil stable backbone. Manchego can be swapped with aged Gouda or sharp Provolone—texture and flavor shift but will still carry the savory factor. Plum optional; green apple slices work but expect more tartness. Common kitchen traps: over dipping kohlrabi makes salad soggy; always drain before combining. If no mandoline, use a sharp knife but slice as thin as possible. Flourish with fresh cracked pepper or microgreens for extra kick."
instructionsNote: "Layering flavors starts at the soak: lemon juice and salt coax kohlrabi’s raw edge away without losing crunch. Massage gently but firmly, you’re waking the veg, not bruising it. Keep a close eye on color change; when edges start looking translucent but center still firm, ready to move on. Drain well here—excess liquid ruins texture and dilutes dressing. Toss pear in remaining lemon, the natural enzyme fight against browning crucial—don’t forget draining here too to avoid watery salad. Add fruits and greens delicately; not a brutal mix, we want contrast in texture, not puree. Dressing—blend oils and vinegar well so flavors marry before adding. Drizzle over salad as bite-sized treat, not pool soaks. Finishing with cheese shavings last preserves their texture against acid and moisture. Taste before serving; salt to brightness. Timing is flexible; some prefer immediate eating, others like 5 minutes rest—try both, note your preference. Keeping salad cool but not fridge cold is key—the warmth unlocks flavor, cool retains bite."
tips:
- "Thin slicing with mandoline is crucial. Uniform slices mean even soak and consistent texture. Without mandoline, sharp knife but shave thin thin, keep size consistent. Thickness impacts soak time; too thick means raw, too thin mushy. Watch edges for translucence Not too long in lemon and salt or softens past snap. Drain liquid well after soak to avoid soggy salad; excess water dulls dressing impact."
- "Pear replaces apple here, less acidic, juicier sweetness. Dice small, keeps bite manageable and prevents overwhelming pear flavor. Toss pear gently in reserved lemon juice to slow browning enzymes. Drain pear too or risk watery mix. Substitute options: Honeycrisp apple works but reduce lemon juice since apple can be tart. Plum wedges optional but add sweet tang and color contrast; skip if textures conflict with preference."
- "Figs bring earthiness. Use fresh halved where possible for texture and flavor balance. Seedless grapes can fill in seasons when figs unavailable; dried apricots chopped too but soften texture, shift sweetness profile. Add fruits last and fold gently; avoid bruising or pureeing fruit with greens. This preserves individual texture and mouthfeel contrast."
- "Dressing balance is key here. Combine olive oil and walnut oil for rich aroma that doesn’t overpower. Walnut oil simulates nutty flavor without nuts, useful for allergy-friendly version. Apple cider vinegar replaced white wine vinegar for softer acidity, better fruit alignment. Whisk well before drizzle; oil-vinegar separate fast otherwise. Avoid overdressing or greens wilt, fruit dulls. Less is more, mindful splash."
- "Salt enhances brightness not just seasoning; measured small amounts as acid and fruit natural sweetness create layers. Taste salad at finish before adjustment. Timing matters; kohlrabi soak varies by slice thickness and freshness. Watch texture not clock. Over-soaked turns mush, under-soaked tastes raw. Cool room temperature best for serving, warmth releases aromas but fridge cold flattens tastes. Fresh cracked pepper or microgreens optional finish for bite and color pop."
faq:
- "q: How long soak kohlrabi? a: Depends on thickness. Watch edges turn translucent, center still firm. Usually 10-12 mins. Not too short raw bite, not too long limp mush. Drain well after. If no time, slice thinner, less soak."
- "q: Can I swap pear for apple? a: Yes but apple more acidic, less juicy. Use crisp variety, slice thin, reduce lemon juice to avoid overpower. Honeycrisp best for replacing here. Plum wedges optional, more tart if used."
- "q: What if salad too soggy? a: Drain kohlrabi super well after soak. Excess water ruins texture and dressing. Avoid over-soaking. Use mandoline or sharp knife thin slices for quicker soak. Serve immediately or within short rest."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cover and refrigerate. Eat next day best for crunch but expect slight softening. Keep dressing separate if possible or toss fresh. Avoid freezer for fresh salad. Wrap tightly to retain aroma but not too cold, fridge chill dulls flavors."
