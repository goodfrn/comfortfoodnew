ingredients:
- "12 ml instant yeast"
- "280 ml warm water"
- "720 ml all-purpose flour"
- "25 ml agave syrup"
- "25 ml avocado oil"
- "3 liters boiling water"
- "175 ml baking soda"
- "Coarse sea salt"
instructions:
- "Warm water with yeast, stir gently until frothy but still a bit cloudy. No worries if some sediment remains."
- "In a big bowl, dump two-thirds flour portion."
- "Add oil, agave syrup and yeast water mixture. Mix till dough forms."
- "Use hands to knead by folding and pressing. Shape into smooth ball."
- "Oil bowl lightly, put dough in, cover with cloth. Let rise about 65 minutes."
- "Turn oven on to 230 C (445 F) ahead of time."
- "Dust surface with remaining flour. Cut dough into six equal pieces."
- "Roll each piece into thin ropes about 1.5 cm thick."
- "Twist ropes into pretzel shapes or freeform knots."
- "Pour baking soda into boiling water, swirling to dissolve."
- "One at a time, dip pretzels in hot soda water 8-12 seconds per side."
- "Lift carefully, arrange on parchment-lined baking sheet."
- "Sprinkle generously with coarse salt."
- "Bake in hot oven for about 7 minutes until golden-crispy edges."
- "Cool just a bit. Serve warm with mustard or cheddar-bacon sauce."
introduction: "Huge, chewy dough ropes. Twist and dip in alkaline hot bath—crust forms fast. Simple ingredients, unexpected tweaks. Yeast wakes up when mixed with warm water, agave adds subtle sweetness. Avocado oil for texture, soft crumb. Baking soda water creates crackly shell. Sprinkle coarse salt for flavor punch. Bake short. Six big, chewy pretzels ready to soak mustard or thick cheese dip. Great snack anytime, vegan and allergen-friendly at once. Mess up dough, knead again. No rush. Pretzels need patience and love. Perfect for sharing or solo munching. Crisp outside, fluffy inside. Salt flakes pop on crust. Warm bites with spicy or smoky dips. Bob’s touch, giant size. Pretzels as handheld comfort food."
ingredientsNote: "Yeast needs warmth but not hot—110°F (about 43°C) is fine. Agave syrup replaces brown sugar; milder, less caramel but balances yeast flavor. Avocado oil smooth, keeps dough moist without overpowering any flavor. Flour divide important for kneading and dusting surface. Baking soda bath crucial step—too little or too much changes crust texture. Coarse salt adds crunch and bursts of saltiness after baking. Use filtered or bottled water if tap is heavily chlorinated; yeast can be sensitive. Dough doughy, sticky at first but must develop gluten through kneading. Resting time varies with room temperature, around an hour best. Avoid egg or dairy to keep vegan and hypoallergenic aspects intact. Large pretzels serve better than dozens small—size affects chew."
instructionsNote: "Yeast plus warm water starts activation. Stir gently, don’t mix too aggressively to preserve yeast bubbles. Flour added in parts helps control dough consistency for better kneading. Knead on clean, floured surface by folding over and pressing with palms, rotate dough ball. Form into smooth, firm ball to help rise evenly. Cover bowl with thin cloth, avoid airtight seal for slight airflow. Let dough swell until doubled; timing varies with warmth. Oven preheated to match boiling soda bath temperature. Roll dough into long thin ropes evenly to create uniform bretzels. Water bath with baking soda key—alkaline bath changes dough surface proteins forming that classic pretzel crust and flavor. Remove pretzels gently using slotted spoon or skimmer to avoid tearing. Arrange pretzels spaced apart on lined baking trays to avoid sticking. Salt generously before baking so it sticks to wet surface. Bake quick at very high heat to get crust without drying crumb. Serve warm for best taste and texture with dips."
tips:
- "Use warm water for yeast activation. Keep it under 110°F. Yeast foams when mixed gently with water. A little sediment is fine."
- "Divide flour for better kneading. One part into dough, rest for dusting. Knead until smooth. Shape into a ball for even rising."
- "Oven preheating is vital. Aim for 230 C. Match bath temperature with oven. Boil water before adding baking soda."
- "Don’t skip baking soda bath. Changes crust texture. Dunk each pretzel for 8-12 seconds. Watch them carefully. Avoid tearing."
- "Salt is crucial. Sprinkle generously on wet surface. Coarse sea salt enhances flavor. Helps create a crunchy crust on top."
faq:
- "q: What if dough doesn’t rise? a: Check temperature. Yeast thrives in warmth. If cold, try longer rising time or warmer spot."
- "q: Can I make ahead? a: Yes. Chill dough after kneading. Roll pretzels next day. Bake fresh. Avoid freezer; texture changes."
- "q: Why pretzels get hard? a: Overbake causes dryness. Watch closely. Crisp short time yields soft inside, crunchy outside."
- "q: Best way to store? a: Keep in airtight container. Room temp for a day. Crisp in oven if soggy. Not fridge; dries fast."
