ingredients:
- "280 g asparagus trimmed sliced into 3-cm pieces"
- "6 eggs"
- "1 batch of lemon yogurt dressing with fresh dill"
- "200 g torn romaine leaves"
- "4 radishes thinly sliced with mandoline"
- "2 small shallots thinly sliced"
- "110 g smoked trout slices"
- "Sweet paprika for dusting"
- "Chopped fresh chives"
instructions:
- "Bring salted water to boil. Add asparagus pieces, cook 2-3 minutes until crisp-tender. Drain, rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Pat dry, place in large bowl."
- "Use same pot to place eggs, cover with cool water about 2 cm above. Heat to boil. Remove from heat, cover pot tightly. Let rest 12 minutes. Drain, refill pot with cold water, cool eggs 3 minutes. Peel under running water, dry."
- "Slice eggs lengthwise. Remove yolks plus two half whites; reserve remaining whites face-up on plate."
- "Mash yolks and halves with 50 ml lemon yogurt dressing and a pinch salt and pepper. Stir well, fill white halves with mix. Sprinkle paprika on top."
- "In large bowl, combine torn romaine, radishes, shallots, asparagus, and leftover dressing. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper."
- "Divide salad among plates. Nestle mimosa eggs on top, layer with smoked trout slices. Garnish with chives. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Asparagus snapped and sliced. Eggs poached hot, then cooled gently. Yogurt lemon dressing bright, tart, with dill twist. Romaine rough torn, crunchy. Radishes and shallots mostly texture and bite, thinly sliced for subtle punch. Smoked trout flaky, salty, on top. Yolks mashed with bits of whites and dressing, creamy dollops stuffed back into whites. Paprika dust for color and mild heat. Chives chopped for fresh snap. Toss salad, assemble, serve cool. Timing tight, everything comes together in less than an hour. Light, fresh, smoky twist without dairy or nuts. Gluten free, balanced plate with good protein and veg."
ingredientsNote: "Asparagus should be fresh, firm stalks, trimming ends neat for even cooking. Eggs medium size, fresh for easy peeling. Lemon yogurt dressing can be homemade or store bought, add chopped dill instead of chives inside for flavor shift. Romaine hearts, use crisp inner leaves for crunch. Radishes thinly shaved make sharp pops; substitute with cucumber slices or fennel thinly sliced for different texture. Shallots mild in flavor here, red onion tougher taste if preferred. Smoked trout offers smoky saltiness; hot smoked salmon or arctic char slices are good swaps. Paprika sweet or hot depends on spice preference. Chives fresh and crisp, scallions in small amounts also work."
instructionsNote: "Cook asparagus quickly once water boils; don’t overcook or lose bite and color. Immediate cold water refresh keeps bright green, stops cooking. Egg cooking technique avoids rubbery yolks; resting covered off heat ensures even cooking without cracking. Peeling under running water helps remove membranes without damage. Separating portions of whites helps balance filling texture. Mashing yolks with some whites and extra dressing achieves creamy filling. Reserve extra whites to hold shape and provide firm base for filling. Dressing split between filling and salad blends flavors throughout. Toss salad just before plating to keep leaves crisp. Garnish with paprika and chives after plating to maintain color and texture. Serve right away for best freshness."
tips:
- "Blanch asparagus quickly. Start with salted boiling water, not too long 2-3 mins max. Immediately shock in ice or cold water to keep green color bright. Drain and pat dry or dressing will get watery. Slice evenly for uniform bite."
- "Eggs peeled easier under running water. After cooking, cool eggs fully before peeling. Rest covered off heat keeps yolks creamy, not rubbery. Remove yolks plus two half whites to balance texture. Reserve rest whites for plating base to hold filling better."
- "Use fresh, firm romaine inner leaves. Tear roughly for texture, avoid thin shredded leaves that get soggy fast. Thin radishes with mandoline or use cucumber for less bite or fennel for another crunch layer. Keep onions or shallots thin so not overpowering."
- "Paprika dust on filled eggs last step. Be mindful of sweet vs hot paprika, adjust to taste preference. Sprinkle just before serving to keep bright color, don't mix into filling or it fades. Chives chopped fresh add crisp herbal note, scallions optional but cautious quantity."
- "Make lemon yogurt dressing ahead if possible. Use homemade or store-bought plain yogurt plus fresh lemon juice and chopped dill. Save some dressing to blend into yolk mix, rest for tossing salad to keep flavors consistent. Toss salad right before plating to prevent limp greens."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid overcooked asparagus? a: Watch timing closely. 2-3 mins boil then ice bath shock stops cooking instantly. Don’t leave in hot water or it loses color bite. Pat dry or salad gets soggy."
- "q: Can I substitute smoked trout? a: Yes. Hot smoked salmon or arctic char works well. Same smoky salty feel. Adjust portion size to match fish thickness. Fresh fish or cured varieties won’t give same texture or flavor."
- "q: Egg yolk filling too dry? a: Add more yogurt dressing slowly. Yolks mash better with creamy binder. Also chop those reserved whites in small pieces, fold in for moisture and balance. Season carefully with salt pepper paprika to liven filling."
- "q: How long can I store leftovers? a: Best eaten same day. Salad greens wilt fast with dressing. Eggs with filling store in airtight container up to 1 day fridge. Asparagus keeps a bit longer if separate. Reassemble before serving for freshness."
