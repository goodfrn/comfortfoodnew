slug: "maple-lattice-tart"
description: "A quick maple cream tart with flaky puff pastry lattice. Cream thickened with tapioca instead of cornstarch. Butter swapped for coconut oil to add a subtle nutty aroma. Puff pastry pre-cut to speed prep. A sprinkle of smoked maple sugar instead of regular maple sugar for a smoky crunch. Cooling the cream covered in plastic wrap stops a skin forming, important for smooth texture. Oven preheated hot to get that golden caramelized puff. A lattice forms a barrier, stopping juices leaking and creating a layered crispiness contrast. Egg wash adds shine. Watch edges; too brown = overdone. Best served warm or room temp for tender-soft filling and crisp pastry contrast."

ingredients:
- "160 ml (2/3 cup) maple syrup"
- "160 ml (2/3 cup) whipping cream 35%"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) tapioca starch"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) coconut oil"
- "1 sheet 220 g puff pastry, thawed"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) water"
- "smoked maple sugar for sprinkling, optional"
instructions:
- "Start with cold pan off heat. Whisk maple syrup, cream, and tapioca starch until smooth. Toss in coconut oil chunks. Move to low-medium heat. Stir constantly; bubbles signal nearing boil — watch it don’t scorch. Once boiling, simmer 20 seconds, thickening into creamy custard. It should coat the spoon, heavy and smooth. Pour in bowl; press plastic wrap directly onto surface to prevent skin. Cool completely in fridge — this step’s non-negotiable for texture."
- "Position oven rack low. Preheat at 210°C (410°F), hotter than usual to give puff that golden blast."
- "Flour board lightly. Roll pastry out 27 cm square. Cut into two equal rectangles. Place on lined baking tray, cover loosely with clean towel, chill 25-30 minutes. Resting stops shrinkage and helps pastry stay crisp during cooking."
- "Mix egg yolk with water. This wash gives shine; don’t skip."
- "On floured board, slice one pastry rectangle into 12 long strips with a pizza cutter or sharp knife. Keep scraps."
- "Moisten border of second rectangle with water (not too wet, a dab then calm). Arrange 3 strips around edge to form a rim; acts like dam for filling—crucial to prevent soggy mess. Fill center evenly with chilled maple cream. Moisten rim again. Lay 5 strips diagonally, spaced evenly, pressing edges gently but firmly onto border. Wet edges again. Weave another 5 strips in opposite diagonal direction, creating a lattice. Reuse dough scraps for extra strips to fill gaps or fix edges if needed."
- "Trim edges clean with sharp knife for neatness. Brush entire top with egg wash — boosts color and seals lattice. Sprinkle lightly with smoked maple sugar for a touch of smoky caramel crunch, optional but worth it."
- "Bake 30-38 minutes. Watch that puff—the pastry should rise sharply, edges golden brown with little blister bubbles. The lattice darkens slightly, crisp and crackly. Avoid over-baking or filling will dry out and crust can burn."
- "Remove, let cool 15 minutes on rack. Warm but not hot best; filling sets but stays silky, pastry crisp but tender. Store leftovers wrapped in fridge but serve near room temp to revive crispness."
introduction: "Maple syrup’s rich sap sweetness meets flaky, buttery puff pastry in this lattice tart. I swapped cornstarch for tapioca starch once after the usual cloudiness started showing in my filling—tapioca gives silkiness, more translucent, less gummy. Coconut oil steps in for butter; adds subtle fragrance and handles heat better, less burn risk. This tart’s rhythmic contrast between tender cream and crisp lattice is a crowd-pleaser. In past batches, the filling skin formed and annoyed me, so I learned to cover with plastic wrap directly, no air gap. The lattice shielding filling stops leaks, keeps edges crisp, and visually makes the tart fancy without fuss. Smoked maple sugar topping lifts it above the typical sweetness, with crunch and gentle smoky notes."
ingredientsNote: "Maple syrup is your star; pure dark grades give richer flavor but lighter maple works too if you prefer milder. Tapioca starch is slippery but yields best non-gummy cream; cornstarch can be swapped back but watch thickening closely. Coconut oil should be refined for neutral flavor or virgin if you want slight coconut aroma—both work fine. Puff pastry—fresh, thawed well, and kept cold is crucial for those explosive layers. Egg yolk mixed with water or milk works for wash; water dries faster, milk gives richer color. Smoked maple sugar is not mandatory but elevates texture and adds complexity. If unavailable, a sprinkle of raw sugar with small pinch smoked paprika gives smoky notes. Adjust liquid quantities proportionally if substituting cream with half & half—expect slightly less richness but decent results."
instructionsNote: "Whisk maple, cream, starch thoroughly off heat first to avoid lumps. Adding fat like coconut oil gives sheen and seals filling’s texture. Monitor once on heat; slow simmer reduces ‘raw starch’ flavor, ensures thickness—you want custard that clings to spoon, no runny glaze stage. Plastic wrap pressed on cream’s surface is a classic chef trick, prevents that annoying skin forming. Don’t skip chilling; filling sets better and is easier to handle. Dye pastry on a floured surface, don’t overwork or it heats up and becomes sticky. Cutting strips evenly is key—pizza cutter is faster, sharper knives work too. Water on pastry edge acts like glue to avoid leaks, no damp or the dough will turn chewy. Weaving lattice strips diagonal way, not just criss-cross, helps structural integrity—watch the dough spacing for oven spring space. Egg wash adds golden glow, moisture to crisp layers. Bake hot and low rack to get puff pastry’s magic puff without burning top. Remove when color is golden with slight crackly bubbles. Let cool some; filling sets just right, pastry retains crisp crunch without becoming dense."
tips:
- "Start whisking cold off heat. Maple syrup, cream, tapioca starch combined first. No lumps. Adding coconut oil chunks right here seals texture later. On stove low-medium, stir constantly. Listen for soft bubbling. Don’t walk away. Near boiling means cream thickens fast then hold it. Too hot scorches flavor; not hot enough stays runny. Custard coats spoon heavy and smooth? Perfect stage to stop."
- "Pressing plastic wrap directly on custard surface. Skip air gaps, skin forms fast otherwise. Fridge chill mandatory—filling firms, easier to handle. I’ve lost batches skipping cooling. Texture noticeable; filling silky, no surface wrinkle. Cream texture improves with this step. Don’t rush; patience pays here."
- "Pastry cutting is key. Roll out 27 cm square on floured board. Chill before weaving. Cold dough essential to keep layers flaky, avoid stickiness. Use pizza cutter for even strips. Water dab on edges acts like glue. Too wet = chewy borders; too dry = leaks. Balance needed. Weaving lattice diagonally supports structure better than criss-cross; gives better oven spring and crisp contrast."
- "Egg wash is more than shine. Mixed with water dries faster than milk version but less color. Brush evenly, don’t soak pastry. Watch edges baking for first signs of burn; adjust oven rack or heat if needed. Oven at 210°C hot and rack low pushes puff pastry magic puff and caramelized color quickly. Missing these causes flat or pale crust."
- "Smoked maple sugar optional but adds distinct crunch and aroma. Substitute with raw sugar + pinch smoked paprika if unavailable. Sprinkle lightly; too much burns. Watch closely through baking toward end. Cooling 15 minutes is crucial. Filling sets just right; pastry stays crisp but not hardened. Refrigerate leftovers wrapped; warm before serving to bring back texture contrast."
faq:
- "q: Why tapioca starch over cornstarch? a: Tapioca gives translucent, silkier cream. Cornstarch can make cloudy or gummy if overcooked. Tapioca needs constant stir, watch thickening carefully. Texture difference noticeable after chilling. I flipped back and forth but tapioca wins for clarity and feel."
- "q: Can I use butter instead of coconut oil? a: Butter okay but coconut oil resists heat better. Butter risks burning; coconut adds gentle nutty aroma without overpowering. If you prefer butter, use refined and watch cooking temp lower. Oils vary in flash point; coconut better near boiling custard."
- "q: Filling forms skin despite plastic wrap? a: Plastic wrap must touch surface, no air gaps. Wrap not tight enough or chilled too warm can cause skin. If happens often, double wrap or press wrap anew mid-chill. You can also stir custard occasionally during cool to break film. Not ideal but helps."
- "q: How to store leftovers without losing crispness? a: Wrap tightly, fridge storage only. Pastry absorbs fridge moisture over time; reheat in oven briefly at moderate temp restores crisp. Microwave kills texture. Room temperature serving better than cold. Use within 2 days; longer wetter and tougher. Freeze not advised due to lattice fragility."
