description: "Macaroni tossed in a rich tomato-beef ragout, layered with creamy cheese sauce and browned mozzarella cheddar crust. Beef browned just right, sauce thickened not too thin or pasty, cheesy top melted and bubbly. Uses fresh thyme and a pinch of chili flakes for subtle punch. Oven finished to golden glory, broiling optional for that extra crust. Swapped Dijon mustard for grainy for texture and tang. Water reserved from pasta to loosen sauce if thickens too much. Fat content balanced with lean ground beef and moderate butter. No eggs, no nuts—simple, hearty, and gratifying."

ingredients:
- "340 g (3/4 lb) macaroni"
- "500 g (1 lb 2 oz) lean ground beef"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "1 medium onion, minced"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) tomato paste"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) fresh thyme leaves"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) crushed red pepper flakes"
- "1 can 540 ml (19 oz) diced tomatoes"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) beef stock"
- "40 g (3 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "30 g (3 tbsp) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "500 ml (2 cups) whole milk"
- "200 g (2 cups) sharp cheddar cheese, grated"
- "200 g (2 cups) part-skim mozzarella, grated"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) grainy mustard"
instructions:
- "=== Pasta Preparation ==="
- "Heat large pot of salted water to rolling boil. Drop macaroni; boil until just before al dente, usually 7 minutes but depends on brand. A chewy bite; don’t overcook, it will finish in oven. Before draining, scoop out 125 ml (1/2 cup) pasta water—save this magic for thinning sauce if needed. Drain macaroni well; set aside."
- "=== Meat Sauce ==="
- "High heat skillet or sauté pan, splash 2 tbsp oil. Toss in ground beef, break apart with wooden spoon, brown aggressively until crusty bits appear and meat’s deep brown, about 8 minutes. Salt and pepper while cooking; flavor builds here. Pull meat out; set aside in bowl to rest."
- "Same pan, medium-high heat. Add remaining oil. Sauté onion and garlic until soft, translucent, and smelling sweet—about 4 minutes. Toss in tomato paste, thyme, red pepper flakes; stir 1 minute. Tomatoes in with their juice, then beef stock added. Return browned beef to skillet. Simmer uncovered, stirring often until liquid almost evaporated, sauce thick but still moist, roughly 15 minutes."
- "===== Combining Pasta and Sauce ====="
- "Stir macaroni into skillet mix; coat pasta in sauce thoroughly. Reduce heat to medium. Stir continuously for 2-3 minutes to let sauce cling to pasta. Watch texture—too dry, splash reserved pasta water little by little to loosen. Taste and adjust salt and pepper now. Remove from heat."
- "=== Cheese Sauce ==="
- "Use same pot from earlier (easier clean-up). Medium heat; melt butter fully but do not brown. Whisk in flour; cook roux, stirring, for 1 minute until it smells nutty but no color change. Gradually whisk in milk, keep stirring to avoid lumps. Bring to gentle boil; whisk constantly until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes."
- "Off heat, fold in half the cheddar and mozzarella cheeses plus grainy mustard. Salt and pepper. Cheese should melt into smooth, thick sauce. Pour sauce evenly over the macaronis and meat mixture; spread thoroughly. Sprinkle remaining cheddar and mozzarella on top for gratin crust."
- "=== Baking ==="
- "Preheat oven to 215°C (420°F). Set rack center. Transfer skillet or put mixture into shallow baking dish. Bake 12-15 minutes until sauce bubbles aggressively and top is golden brown. If surface not browned enough, switch to broil for 2-3 minutes—watch carefully to avoid burning. Let rest 5 minutes before serving to settle flavors and thicken further."
- "=== Tips and Tweaks ==="
- "Grainy mustard adds texture; swap for Dijon if preferred for smoother taste. Mozzarella balanced part-skim for melt without greasy mess. Lean beef controls grease; pork or turkey are valid but adjust seasoning. Sauce thickness crucial: liquify with pasta water or reduce more but never paste-like. Baking seals flavor, keeps pasta cozy and moist."
- "Don’t skip reserved pasta water trick—it transforms dry sauce into silky coating. Pan choice matters: oven-proof skillet saves a dish and scrubbing, but baking dish is fine. Stir meat often for browning—not stewing. Using fresh thyme over dried gives vibrant earthy hints. Feel and smell progress; browned bits and tomato aromas key check marks."
introduction: "Burger gone Italian, cheesy pastas with meaty guts. Not just mac and cheese—the beef sings. Pungent thyme, spicy flicker from red pepper in the background. I always keep pasta water nearby, fixes sauce stiffness instantly. Browning beef right turns flavor volume way up; stewing meat results in flat taste. Cheese sauce handles all the glue business, thick but no clumps, thanks to slow, steady whisking. Oven baking with broil accentuates the crust, making it crunchy-cheesy at top and gooey beneath. This isn’t fast food but not complicated either. Real comfort plate — revel in the aroma of fading tomato stew mixed with molten cheddar and mozzarella. No shortcuts missing, just direct heat soul. Grainy mustard? Might sound odd but that little pop wakes the cheese, try it."
ingredientsNote: "Scaling up or down? Keep cheese ratios intact or sauce gets off balance. Whole milk creates luscious sauce; skim or alternative milk won't thicken right—if you must, add an extra tbsp flour to compensate. Ground beef swap? Pork or turkey lean, add umami powder or Worcestershire for depth. Fresh thyme preferred; dried works if you crush it finely beforehand to release oils. Crushed red pepper flakes adjustable by taste—start small if unaccustomed. Grainy mustard adds texture beneath cheese; Dijon for smoother tang. Pasta water—always save at least half a cup. No oil? Butter or bacon grease works, but changes flavor. Onion garlic sauté slow enough to avoid crisp edges yet caramelized aroma ideal; no burnt garlic, never."
instructionsNote: "Brown ground beef on hot pan. Watch for crusty areas; those bits give deep taste. After removing beef, use same pan for onions/garlic—retains flavor bits. Tomato paste sauté activates brightness. Reduce liquids fully to concentrate flavors—don’t rush. Toss pasta in, let sauce thicken as it marries. Cheese sauce roux needs constant whisking to prevent lumps. When boiling milk in roux, don’t turn heat up too fast or curdling risk rises. Add cheese off heat, stir gently to melt smoothly. Grainy mustard incorporates tang and crumbly texture. Spread sauce atop pasta evenly; then sprinkle cheese for even browning. Bake until bubbly; broil close attention. Timing approximate—check visual cues over clock. Rest finishing plate for cohesive flavors and avoid molten burns. Practical tip: measuring and mixing cheeses before hand speeds step. Serve after brief cooldown, else cutting messy."
tips:
- "Brown beef on high heat; listen for crackle and watch edges brown deeply. Brown bits matter, flavor packed. Don’t stir too often, let crust form. Rest meat separately; juices redistribute, keeps beef juicy and tender."
- "Reserve pasta water before draining macaroni; thick sauce can turn pasty fast. Add water bit by bit to loosen sauce. Stops clumpy texture and keeps coating glossy. Pasta water salty, adjust seasoning after adding."
- "Butter-flour roux must cook 1 full minute until nutty smell, no color change. Whisk in milk slowly, no lumps allowed. Heat medium, don’t rush boil or sauce curdles. Whisk constantly; thickens fast near boiling point."
- "Cheese off heat or low heat avoids oily separation. Grainy mustard gives cheese sauce texture and tang; Dijon swap if smooth taste wanted but loses texture. Mix half cheese in sauce, sprinkle rest on top for crust crunch."
- "Watch oven closely last minutes; bubbling sauce signals near done, browning top is visual cue. Broil 2-3 minutes optional but risky; crust forms fast. Rest bake plate for 5 minutes; sauce thickens, flavors meld, easier cutting."
faq:
- "q: How to keep beef juicy without drying? a: High heat browning crucial; crust forms seal. Rest meat separate off heat. Avoid stewing beef or overcrowding pan. Hot pan equals flavor layers, don’t rush browning."
- "q: Can I use different cheese blends? a: Yes, cheddar sharpness key, mozzarella for melt. Swap part with gouda or gruyère if you like. Avoid overly greasy cheeses. Balance textures; melting cheeses bind sauce."
- "q: What if sauce is too thick or too thin? a: Add reserved pasta water gradually if thick. Thin with stock or milk if needed but careful. Over-thick leads to gluey mouthfeel, thin won’t cling. Watch after adding liquids; sauce changes fast."
- "q: How to store leftovers best? a: Fridge in sealed container, consume 2-3 days. Reheat oven or microwave, add splash milk if dry. Freeze in portions okay but cheese crust may lose crispness. Defrost gently for best texture."
