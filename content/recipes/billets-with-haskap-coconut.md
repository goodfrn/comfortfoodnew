ingredients:
- "=== Haskap Syrup ==="
- "210 g frozen haskap berries (about 1 1/3 cups)"
- "120 g granulated sugar (scant 2/3 cup)"
- "25 ml water (1 2/3 tablespoons)"
- "20 ml fresh lime juice"
- ""
- "=== Cake ==="
- "5 large eggs, separated"
- "75 g granulated sugar (1/3 cup)"
- "120 g unbleached all-purpose flour (3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon)"
- ""
- "=== Filling and Coating ==="
- "60 g unsweetened shredded coconut"
- "240 ml whipping cream 35%"
- "20 g powdered sugar (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)"
- "5 ml honey"
- "3 ml almond extract"
instructions:
- "=== Prep the syrup ==="
- "Pour frozen haskap, sugar, and water into a saucepan. Medium-high heat, bubbling and gentle crackling sounds as sugar melts. Stir often—don’t scorch. When mixture thickens and darkens—around 6 minutes—remove from heat."
- "Set a fine mesh sieve over a bowl. Pour syrup through, gently pressing the berries just enough to release flavor, not pulp. Should get about 200 ml syrup. If too little, top up with water. Return strained berries and any leftover juice to pan."
- "Add lime juice—sharp scent rises. Simmer very gently 3-4 minutes until berries soften but not mushy. Remove to cool bowl."
- "=== Cake batter ==="
- "Preheat oven to 185 °C (365 °F) – slightly lower than usual, helps tender crumb. Line a 45 x 33 cm baking sheet with parchment, leaving overhang on long sides."
- "Whisk egg whites lightly first. Add 20 g of sugar and start whipping on medium speed till soft peaks form. Slowly add rest of sugar in drizzle, speed to high. Watch for shiny stiff peaks—not dry. Here’s the trick: low speed drizzle folding in helps sugar dissolve."
- "Lower mixer speed, drip in 180 ml of cooled syrup in a fine stream, folding gently to keep air. Whisk in egg yolks one at a time, careful not to deflate."
- "Sift flour over meringue. Fold delicately with a spatula or whisk tip. Watch batter for uniformity but don’t overmix—rustling silence gives way to roast-like scent signals ready."
- "Spread quickly and evenly on sheet. Tap pan once sharply to pop any big bubbles on surface."
- "=== Baking and cooling ==="
- "Place sheet in center of oven. Bake 18-22 minutes. Edges look pale gold. Center springy but not wet. If it sticks to your finger, it needs 1-2 more minutes. Don’t brown too much or it becomes dry and crumbly."
- "Slide a thin offset spatula along edges, loosening cake from parchment. Invert immediately onto clean parchment. Peel off baking paper carefully. Leave cake facing smooth side up; this will be the exterior upon rolling."
- "Cut off narrow crust strips lengthwise to equalize edges."
- "=== Filling and assembly ==="
- "Mix coconut with remaining 20 ml syrup until soaked and coloured pale purple. Set aside on plate spread out to keep loose, not clumped."
- "Beat cream with powdered sugar, honey, and almond extract until soft peaks. Do not overbeat or risk grainy texture."
- "Spread cooled jammy haskap berry pulp evenly over cake. Then cover with three-quarters of the whipped cream, smooth with spatula."
- "Slice cake crosswise in half. Roll each half tightly from longer edge. Feel resistance but no cracking. Use parchment over rolls to help keep shape."
- "Coat rolled billets with remaining cream sparingly, avoid overlayer that droops."
- "Roll billets in coconut mixture, pressing gently so flakes stick well. Chill in fridge for at least 30 minutes to set shape."
- "Slice each billet into 3 equal portions just before serving."
- "Store airtight in fridge max 3 days; note coconut might soften slightly."
introduction: "Haskap berries—not your everyday fruit. Tart, almost wild. Mixed with sugar and reduced, they become a deep purple syrup that holds a funky edge. Tried blueberry, too, not the same snap. Egg whites whipped soft then stiff; folding in syrup keeps cake moist, not dry like last summer’s attempt. Coconut adds texture and sweet chew, contrasting the sharp haskap. Honey and almond in cream add warmth, a subtle counterpoint. Rolling cakes is always risky—too tight, cracks; too loose, flops. Watch for silkiness under your fingers when folding flour in; don’t rush. Patience in cooling, rolling, then coating. The color—cloudy purple mixed with white—it’s rustic, earthy, unpretentious."
ingredientsNote: "Haskap berries can be swapped for fresh blackberries or frozen blueberries—expect milder flavor. Sugar reduced slightly here to keep tartness alive. Lime juice instead of lemon brings different brightness—tangier, less citrus heavy. Flour measured unpacked but sifted to loosen, avoids dense batter. Coconut: unsweetened preferred; toasted adds nuttiness but dries cake faster. Whipping cream always cold, adds volume. Honey can be replaced by maple syrup for earthiness; almond extract swapped for vanilla if nut flavors unwanted. Adjust based on stock and guest preference. If no parchment, grease sheet well and dust with flour. Fresh eggs whip better. Avoid condensation on berries, pat dry before heating."
instructionsNote: "Start syrup first; watch bubbling stage. Too long boiling tightens sugars and darkens too much—bitter. Press berries lightly in sieve—over-smashing adds grit and cloudiness. Adding juice after straining preserves fresh taste. Whisk whites clean and dry bowl essential; any fat wrecks foam. Gradual sugar addition builds stable peaks. Incorporating syrup into meringue tricky—slow drizzle, whisk low to keep air. Fold flour gently or fluff lost, cake toughens. Baking times vary with oven; test gently with touch. Cooling inverted keeps dome flat, easier rolling. Rolling best done with smooth side out for look and texture. Coconut soak softens flakes but not soggy; press on lightly. Chill lets cream firm up, rolls keep form. Cutting billets cold yields cleaner slices. Store in sealed container; coconut flakes absorb fridge moisture over time so consume within 3 days."
tips:
- "Start syrup on medium-high; watch for bubbling crackles. Too fast scorches sugar, too slow dulls berry punch. Press berries lightly when sieving, too much pulp adds grit and muddy color. Control simmer, avoid soft mushy berries or sharp tartness sharpens not sour. Keep syrup quantity consistent, topping with water if low. Aromas darken, deep purple shadows mean done."
- "Whip egg whites first at medium speed till soft peaks emerge. Gradual sugar drizzle on low speed builds stable meringue. Rapid speed too early breaks foam. Folding syrup in slow and steady to keep light air pockets. Mix yolks gently after for richness without deflation. Watch texture, satin shine signals ready stage. Batter uniform but no overwork; rustling hints flour blended just right."
- "Baking at slightly lower temp keeps crumb tender versus dry brittle edges. Tap pan to burst big bubbles before oven; surface should look matte with small pinholes. Cooling inverted keeps rollable dome; hot cake cracks curling edges. Peel paper carefully. Cutting crust tightens roll edge; slice off thin strips lengthwise. Rolling with parchment helps hold shape, tension feels like stretch but not strain."
- "Soak coconut in leftover berry syrup for soft purple coating. Press flakes lightly but no soggy clumps. Keep separate plate spread out. Whipping cream cold ensures volume. Add powdered sugar, honey, almond extract last and whip till soft peaks only. Overbeating risks grainy texture, gets lumpy not fluffy. Spread cream sparingly on rolled tube, too thick will droop and look messy on plating."
- "Rolling billets tight enough to feel resistance but no cracking marks successful fold. Chill minimum 30 minutes to firm shape before slicing. Cutting cold slices neater, prevents smear. Store airtight max 3 days; coconut flakes absorb fridge moisture and soften. Using frozen berries better fresh if available, flavor sharper but juice varies. Lime juice swaps for lemon; different brightness but still citrus punch."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid cracked cake roll? a: Roll while still warm but not hot; cool inverted first keeps flexible dome. Thin crust trims edge. Parchment helps form tension. Don’t rush folding. Softer crumb from lower bake temp means better foldability."
- "q: What if syrup is too thick or too thin? a: Too thick, add small splash water before folding in. Too thin, cook down longer until syrup coats spoon cleanly. Watch boiling time carefully to avoid bitter burnt sugar flavors. If watery, bake batter promptly or cake soggy."
- "q: Can I replace haskap berries? a: Use frozen blueberries or blackberries same quantity. Flavor milder, less sharp snap. Adjust sugar if sweeter fruit. Color changes too, less intense purple. Taste tests recommended before syrup step."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep wrapped airtight in fridge max 3 days. Coconut flakes get soft with moisture; consume soon. Freeze billets in sealed bag for longer keep. Thaw in fridge, texture alters slightly. Avoid room temp storage, cream spoils."
