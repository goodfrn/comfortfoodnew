slug: "easter-sheet-pan-cookies"
description: "Chunky sheet pan cookie loaded with chopped Cadbury eggs and chocolate chips. Uses rich brown sugar and melted butter for chewiness. Bakes at moderate heat till edges golden, center still soft. Sweet spots of melty chocolate, gooey caramel from the eggs. Easy prep and spread on a standard half sheet pan. Great for sharing, cutting into sizable squares. Swapping milk with cream boosts richness; dark chocolate chips add depth. Underbake slightly to avoid drying out as it sets on the pan. Flaky salt on top contrasts sweetness sharply. Mix thick, batter will spread, trust the process. Mess-free chocolate chopping method included."

ingredients:
- "7 tablespoons unsalted butter melted"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "3/4 cup packed light brown sugar"
- "2 whole large eggs"
- "2 egg yolks"
- "1/4 cup whole milk"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1 cup chopped chopped Cadbury cream eggs (see tip)"
- "1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips"
- "Optional: flaky sea salt for topping"
instructions:
- "=== Cadbury egg chopping tip ==="
- "Place the cream eggs in a ziplock bag. Seal tightly. Take a rolling pin, give a couple firm whacks. No mess, nice chunky bits perfect for pockets of goo. Tried hacking on board? Sticky nightmare, trust me."
- "=== Preheat and prep pan ==="
- "Crank oven to 320 F. Standard half sheet pan, 13x18 inches. Spray with nonstick spray. No parchment needed here, batter sticks but also spreads and releases nicely."
- "=== Melt, whisk, sugar time ==="
- "Melt butter first so it’s warm but not bubbling. Dump sugars in large bowl, add melted butter. Whisk, whisk, whisk. Break lumps from brown sugar. Soft fresh brown sugar helps; stale clumps make uneven texture."
- "=== Wet stuff in ==="
- "Drop in whole eggs plus extra yolks, milk, vanilla. Whisk until uniform. Smooth consistency but not runny. Eggs bring moisture and richness."
- "=== Dry ingredients next ==="
- "Sift flour with baking powder and salt. Fold into wet, gently but no overmixing. Batter will be thick, almost doughy but pliable."
- "=== Chocolate explosion ==="
- "Fold in chopped Cadbury egg bits and chocolate chips. At least a cup each. The charm lies in those hidden pockets of melty candy and chocolate. Batter thick and chunky now, just right."
- "=== Spread & top ==="
- "Spoon out onto prepared pan. Press and spread evenly to edges. Don’t freak, it will settle and spread in bake. Top with extra candy and chips –scatter before baking or after for melty glossy hits."
- "=== Into the oven ==="
- "Bake 18-23 min but watch attentively. Edges golden to faint tan, center still looks soft and squishy when jiggle gently. Cookie set but not firm, not dry. Oven temps vary dramatically so handle like a detective."
- "=== Cool & finish ==="
- "Tap the pan gently if puffed too much to settle. Let rest completely on pan, carryover cooking firm up centers. Sprinkle flaky sea salt if desired. Cool fully before slicing into 24 squares. Enjoy the gooey bursts."
introduction: "Chopping up Cadbury eggs usually ends in sticky fingers and tame chunks. Tried smashing in a bag? Game-changer. Batter thickening to a near-dough, loaded with gooey candy chunks. Brown sugar freshness is key to avoid tough spots. Baked in a half sheet pan, these cookies spread and puff then settle flat. Visual cues like faintly golden edges and soft centers tell you when to pull from oven. I learned the hard way – overbaking kills the softness, underbaking keeps the magic. Flaky salt added after baking contrasts the insane sweetness brilliantly."
ingredientsNote: "Butter here melted, not browned; saves time and builds chewiness. Swap milk for half & half or cream for richer crumb. Brown sugar freshness vital – stale means clumpy batter and denser cookie. Baking powder, not baking soda, because of balanced sweetness and slight lifting for texture; soda risks bitterness. Salt measured carefully to balance sweet Cadbury candies; balance is key. Chocolate chips not mini for melt pockets but not huge chunks – semi-sweet for flavor balance. More candy or chips on top optional for extra melty glossy hits. If no Cadbury eggs, substitute chopped caramels with chopped creme-filled chocolates."
instructionsNote: "Whisking melted butter with sugars might feel sloppy but it destroys sugar clumps, smooth bake outcome. Adding wet ingredients next helps blend smoother dough with no flour pockets. Folding dry ingredients reduces gluten development – chewy, not tough cookies. The batter looks thick almost like soft dough, don’t panic; it spreads in oven. Bake at modest heat, allowing edges to turn golden while center stays soft. Visual jiggle test beats timing for doneness; gently shake pan and center should wobble slightly but not be runny. Cooling on sheet crucial for carryover cooking; cookie firms up as it cools, don’t rush slicing. Flaky sea salt on top after baking is subtle but necessary dimension. Baking times vary so trust appearance and touch more than clock."
tips:
- "Chop Cadbury eggs inside sealed bag. Use rolling pin whacks. Avoid sticky mess. Chunky bits create gooey candy pockets. Smaller pieces risk melting out completely. It’s key to get nice rough chunks not puree."
- "Butter melted warm not hot. Cool if bubbling starts. Mix with sugars immediately. Break brown sugar clumps by whisking hard. Fresh brown sugar critical. Stale means dense spots and uneven bake texture. This step shows early impact."
- "Fold dry ingredients gently to avoid gluten over development. Batter looks thick; almost doughy but pliable. Don’t overmix or it stiffens. Thick batter spreads during baking. Expect some resistance but it’ll settle in oven heat."
- "Oven set at 320 F or moderate heat. Sheet pan does spread and bake evenly but watch time closely. 18-23 min range. Edges shifting from pale to faint golden is big cue. Center looks soft, jiggles slightly when shaken. Not firm, not raw."
- "Top with extra Cadbury bits or chocolate chips before or after baking for melty glossy hits. Flaky sea salt on baked surface adds contrast. Salt late after cooling helps balance sweetness sharply. Sprinkle lightly. This contrast lifts flavors in huge way."
faq:
- "q: Why melt butter first? a: Melting warms it for easy mixing with sugar. Avoid bubbling- overheated butter changes texture. It smooths blending, stops granules clumping. Adds chew, not greasy lumps. Cold butter won’t mix evenly here."
- "q: Can milk be swapped? a: Yes- half and half or cream gives richer crumb. Milk keeps lighter. Try cream if you want deeper chew and moisture. Watch batter thickness; cream might thicken dough more. Adjust flour if too thick."
- "q: What if cookies dry out? a: Overbaking is culprit. Edges golden but centers must jiggle slightly. Cookie firms on pan while cooling. Slight underbake keeps chew and gooey candy bits intact. If too firm, cut baking time down next go."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container at room temp okay few days. Refrigerate slows softness but extends life. Freeze flattened dough or baked bars wrapped tight. Thaw room temp. Warm slightly before serving to revive gooey melt feel."
