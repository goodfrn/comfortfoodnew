title: "Leek Shrimp Quiche Remix"
slug: "leek-shrimp-quiche"
description: "A savory quiche with a flaky crust, packed with sautéed shrimp and tender leeks. The butter-flour combo creates a rich pâte brisée, while the filling blends eggs, cream, and herbs for depth. Roasting shrimp quickly seals flavor without toughening. Slightly caramelized leeks add sweetness and earthiness. The custard cooks until just set, with a golden top and gentle wobble beneath. Work fast with cold ingredients; warm dough is a trap. Substitute shrimp for lobster or scallops if fancy. Fresh thyme swaps well with tarragon or chives. Adjust baking time, watch crust edges—too brown means flavors skew bitter. Rest quiche to let filling thicken before slicing."
metaDescription: "Leek Shrimp Quiche Remix with flaky pâte brisée, caramelized leeks, and tender shrimp. Roasted, custard set just right, subtle herbs. Six servings French-inspired dish."
ogDescription: "Flaky crust meets caramelized leeks and quick-seared shrimp. Herb notes shift with tarragon or chives. Custard wobbles, golden edge. A kitchen tested quiche variant."

ingredients:
- "PÂTE BRISÉE"
- "230 ml (1 cup) all-purpose flour"
- "1.5 ml (1/3 tsp) salt"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) cold unsalted butter, cubed"
- "1 large egg"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) ice water"
- "FILLING"
- "400 g (14 oz) cleaned shrimp, chopped into 1.2 cm (1/2 inch) pieces"
- "3 garlic cloves, minced"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh tarragon, finely chopped"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) avocado oil"
- "4 large eggs, lightly beaten"
- "200 ml (3/4 cup) heavy cream"
- "200 ml (scant 1 cup) sautéed leeks, soft and lightly browned"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== PÂTE BRISÉE ==="
- "Pulse flour and salt in food processor just to mix. Drop butter cubes in; pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand. Avoid overworking. Add egg and cold water; pulse a few seconds until dough clumps. Form ball quickly, wrap in plastic. Chill minimum 40 minutes so gluten relaxes; smoother dough easier to roll, prevents shrinkage."
- "Flour counter, roll out dough to thin round, about 3 mm thick. Gently transfer to 24 cm (9.5 inch) tart pan with removable bottom. Press evenly, trim edges neat. Dock bottom with fork to prevent bubbling. Chill again at least 25 minutes. Cold pastry shrinks less, holds shape better under wet filling."
- "Preheat oven to 185 °C (365 °F) with rack low; crust wants bottom heat crispness. Line crust with parchment, fill with pie weights or dried beans. Blind bake 12–15 minutes till pale golden. Remove weights, bake 5 more minutes till edges just start to color. Edges burning? Shield with foil strips."
- "=== FILLING ==="
- "Heat oil in heavy skillet over medium-high. Toss shrimp, garlic, tarragon in pan; sauté stirring just until shrimp curl, turn pinkish white, about 1 1/2 minutes. Avoid overcooking shrimp here; they cook more in oven. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat; let cool slightly."
- "In separate pan, render leeks slowly in butter or oil until soft, translucent, edges barely caramelized. Season lightly. Roughly 8-10 minutes medium heat. Avoid browning too dark - bitter."
- "In bowl, whisk eggs with heavy cream. Add cooled shrimp and leeks. Stir gently to combine; taste now for salt and pepper. Filling should be well seasoned—not bland. Pour into pre-baked crust. Fill should sit just below rim to avoid spillover."
- "Bake in lower third of oven 45-50 minutes. Tell finished when custard has slight jiggle in center but edges are set and top begins to blush gold. Insert toothpick near center—if wet, more time. If cracks appear, oven too hot or overbaked."
- "Remove quiche, cool on rack 10-15 minutes. Filling firms up as it rests, easier to slice without collapsing. Serve warm with peppery arugula or simple green salad dressed with mustard vinaigrette."
- "=== TIPS AND SUBSTITUTIONS ==="
- "Substitute avocado oil with light olive oil or grapeseed oil for neutral taste. Tarragon swapped with chives or fresh basil for different herbal notes. Cream can be half and half or whole milk for lighter texture; affect custard firmness. If no food processor, cut butter into flour with two knives or fingers quickly till sandy. Cold ingredients key; warm dough tough, shrinks."
- "If crust shrinks, dock the dough more and chill well. For a nutty twist, sprinkle finely grated pecorino or Parmesan on bottom crust before blind baking. To avoid soggy bottom, oven temp needs to be consistent; consider baking stone."
- "Overcooked shrimp are rubbery; watch them like a hawk in pan. Leeks need patience—soft not brown. Mixing shrimp cold into hot eggs creates pockets and uneven texture; cool or room temp."
- "If filling too liquid despite cooking, increase egg ratio or bake slightly longer but not browned harshly."
- "Leftovers reheat well wrapped in foil, oven 160 °C until warm. Not sublime cold."
- "Use heavier pan for sautéing shrimp for quick sear without steaming."
- "Egg wash on crust edges before blind baking can give golden beautiful finish. Brush lightly."
- "Don't skip resting dough steps—even if impatient. Dough relaxes, easier to handle, less elastic resistance and thus no recoil during baking."
- "Line pan edges with foil strips mid-baking if crust is browning too fast but custard needs more time."
- "Avoid metal tart pan edges if possible; they conduct heat too fast—favor ceramic or glass pans to moderate and even bake."
introduction: "Chopped shrimp, caramelized leeks, eggs, and cream in a buttery crust. No fluff. Just technique and instincts. Flaky dough demands cold butter, quick pulses. Leeks need slow coaxing till soft and golden, not burned. Shrimp thrown in hot pan, just turned opaque — no rubbery mistakes this time. Custard fills that vessel barely wobbles then sets firm but tender. Resting matters to tame juice slack. Serve with peppery greens. Alternate herbs, swap shrimp for scallops when in mood. Past tries? Overcooked shrimp, soggy bottoms, tired crusts begging for patience. Learned that cooling dough and pre-bake matter most. Keep eye on crust color; foil rescue for burnt edges. This one sings when you watch and listen — the crackle as crust bakes, garlic scent mingling. Patience, respect your ingredients. Here’s how."
ingredientsNote: "Flour and butter temps decide texture—no warm butter, no sticky dough. Egg adds binding but water hydrates enough for pliable roll. Substitute butter with lard for flakier crust but less flavor complexity. Tarragon swaps for tarragon vinegar or chives if unavailable—different aroma profiles but same fresh herb punch. Avoid pre-chopped herbs if possible, dry out quickly. Heavy cream gives silky custard body; whole milk lightens but risks loose texture. Leeks—best washed thoroughly; grit ruins mouthfeel. Shrimp frozen? Thaw completely, pat dry; moisture kills sear. For quick cool, spread dough on cold slab. Longer chilling, better roll. Use pie weights or dried beans for blind bake; raw dough shrinks fiercely under filling weight else. Salt crust lightly for layered seasoning. With a pinch of luck, crust resists sogginess when blind baked properly."
instructionsNote: "Combine dry, then cut in butter till sandy—not paste. Egg and water meld dough into cohesive mass, but no overmix; tough crust imminent then. Rest periods crucial; chill before and after molding to avoid recoil. Dock crust bottom; prevents rising blister bubbles. Blind bake protects crust soggy fate—watch edges for early color warnings. Sauté shrimp fast at high heat—shrimp finish in oven. Overdone shrimp like rubber bands spoil dish texture. Leeks need low, slow conversation with butter until sweet and soft; stop before any bitterness. Mix eggs with cream smooth, then gently fold in seafood and vegetables. Pour into crust where filling just hugs edge, no spillover. Bake steady at moderate heat till custard sets with slight wobble in center—test with toothpick but avoid stabbing repeatedly. Resting quiche firm enough to slice clean but still tender. Reveal golden top, earthy aromas fills kitchen at this stage."
tips:
- "Skip warm butter or dough gets sticky and elastic then recoil happens in oven. Keep chunks cold, pulse in food processor quick - coarse sand texture. Egg and water just enough to bring dough together; no glue. Chill dough twice; before rolling and after fitting crust. Stops shrinkage and keeps crisp edges. Dock bottom well so no giant bubbles. Parchment with pie weights key for blind bake - dried beans work fine but no skipping."
- "Sear shrimp fast; listen for snap fizz in hot oil. Shrimp curl, pink only, pale white on edges means time to stop. Overcook they rubber, grill marks don’t matter here. Toss in tarragon but vary with chives or basil if flavor shift needed. Keep salt till end or shrimp purge water. Cool shrimp before folding; hot shrimp scrambles eggs, pockets form, uneven texture."
- "Caramelize leeks slow, low-medium heat. Edge just golden, no dark brown. Bitter hits fast when too long. Render them translucent first, then tiny color hints. That slow coaxing builds deep sweetness but not soggy mess. Stir often. Use butter or avocado oil for richness; can swap oil types but avoid olive for stronger flavor dominance."
- "Pour custard mix into crust just below rim; filling swells slightly. Too much and spill, leaking soggy edges. Stir eggs and cream thoroughly, fold shrimp and leeks gently. Taste for seasoning—don’t rely on shrimp salt alone, double check. Custard jiggly but set when toothpick near center comes out clean or slightly moist. Cracks mean temp too high or overbaked; reduce oven rack heat if needed."
- "If crust edges brown too fast, foil shields mid-bake. Use thick strips, snug fit, no gaps or edges burn faster. Rest quiche 10-15 minutes post baking on rack. Filling firms up and stops running if sliced right when hot. For reheating, foil wrap oven 160° until warm does best; microwave ruins texture. Nutty tweak: sprinkle grated pecorino or parmesan on bottom crust before blind bake - adds crunch and umami."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid rubbery shrimp? a: Sear shrimp over high heat just till curl and turn pink white edges. Remove from heat early. Shrimp finish cooking inside oven. Avoid overcrowding pan or shrimp stew in own juice. Watch color shift; no gray or opaque. Timing crucial or texture toughens fast."
- "q: Can I substitute herbs? a: Yes, tarragon swaps well with fresh chives or mild basil. Each changes aroma; tarragon adds slight anise note. Dry herbs not recommended; lose brightness. Tarragon vinegar alternative but add less volume, vinegar acidity changes custard balance slightly."
- "q: What if crust shrinks? a: Dock dough thoroughly before blind baking. Chill dough well before, again after pressing into pan. Short resting times cause elastic recoil. Use pie weights or dried beans for even blind baking and avoid bubbling. If edges start to brown quickly, foil shield edges to prevent burning while custard cooks."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap tightly in foil or airtight container. Refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat in oven 160 °C; microwave ruins flaky texture, often rubberizes shrimp and soggifies crust. Quiche freezes okay but texture softens; thaw overnight in fridge then warm oven reheat. Not ideal but acceptable."
