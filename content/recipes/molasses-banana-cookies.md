title: "Molasses Banana Cookies"
slug: "molasses-banana-cookies"
description: "Banana softens dough infused with warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Molasses and brown sugar deliver rich, deep sweetness. Butter and eggs bind ingredients into tender, chewy cookies. Quick baking at moderate heat brings golden bases and chewy middles. Surface sprinkled with sugar offers slight crunch. A twist swaps ginger for cardamom and oat flour in place of some all-purpose, adding texture and lightly nutty notes. Baking time slightly cut to 12-18 minutes depending on oven. Makes around 18 cookies."

ingredients:
- "290 g (2 cups) all-purpose flour sifted"
- "60 g (1/2 cup) oat flour"
- "1 tbsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon ground"
- "1/2 tsp cardamom ground"
- "1/4 tsp nutmeg ground"
- "Pinch salt"
- "100 g (7 tbsp) unsalted butter softened"
- "180 g (3/4 cup) dark brown sugar packed"
- "110 ml (1/3 cup plus 1 tbsp) molasses"
- "1 large egg"
- "2 ripe bananas mashed"
- "Sugar for sprinkling (optional)"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack middle position. Preheat oven 175 °C (347 °F). Line two cookie sheets with parchment or silicone mats."
- "Sift or whisk together flours, baking powder, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, salt in medium bowl."
- "In large bowl, beat butter, brown sugar, molasses until fluffy with mixer on medium. Add egg, mix until just combined."
- "Fold dry ingredients into wet slowly, add mashed bananas last. Use wooden spoon or low speed mixer. Batter thick and sticky."
- "Drop dough by 45 ml (3 tbsp) spoonfuls on sheets spaced 5 cm (2 in) apart. Optional sprinkle sugar on top for crunch."
- "Bake 12-18 minutes one tray at a time. Edges golden, bottoms lightly browned. Avoid overbaking to keep chewiness."
- "Cool 5 minutes on sheets then transfer to wire racks to finish cooling."
introduction: "Banana mashed. Molasses thick and dark. Spices warm the dough. Butter beaten, sugar softens into a creamy mix. Sweet, sticky, a soft chew beneath slight sugar crunch. Not your usual simple cookie. Cardamom sneaks in the place of sharp ginger. Oat flour gives a touch of earthiness and chew. Baking moved faster. Timed less, but watch close. Golden and tender. Slightly different. Results spill beyond moisturizer. Good with tea, decent with coffee. Simple snacks aren't dull. They push flavor in quiet ways. No long waits or complex tools. Just batter, heat, and patience."
ingredientsNote: "Substituted oat flour for a portion of wheat flour adds texture and subtle nuttiness while reducing gluten, helping keep cookies tender. Cardamom instead of ginger brings floral warmth, less sharpness. Molasses reduced slightly balancing the sweetness and strong molasses flavor without overwhelming the banana notes. Brown sugar quantity lowered but remains integral for chew and moisture. Butter softened but not melted keeps structure stable. Bananas ripe and mashed fine enough to blend but still lending moisture and flavor. Optional sugar on top adds mild crunch contrast. Quantities adapted to reduce total volume slightly and help dough hold shape better during baking."
instructionsNote: "Begin with oven warming, rack centered for even heat. Lining pans prevents sticking no need for greasing. Dry ingredients sifted or whisked ensures even distribution of leavening and spices. Beat butter, sugar, molasses till creamy avoids grainy texture and helps aerate dough. Blend egg in carefully to avoid breaking emulsion. Fold in dry ingredients gently to maintain tender crumb, do not overmix. Bananas added last so they don’t break down volume prematurely. Form dough with a consistent spoon measure for uniform baking. Space dough balls well; biscuits spread but not excessively. Sugar on top optional, adds slight crisp contrast. Bake trays one at a time to ensure even cooking. Bake 12 to 18 minutes to just golden at base, edges formed but interiors still soft for chewiness. Cool on trays briefly to set shape, then move to racks to avoid soggy bottoms from steam trapped under. Timing and temperature variations affect texture so watch closely during last minutes."
tips:
- "Measure flour accurately. Spoon it lightly into the cup. Pressing may lead to dense cookies. Sifting helps. Blend dry before mixing wet."
- "Use ripe bananas. Spotty is good. Mashed fine, mix in last. Their moisture blends well but keeps dough light. Not over mash."
- "Baking sheets matter. Use parchment. Keeps cookies from sticking. Not greasing needed. Space well on sheets. Avoid crowding."
- "Timing is core. Check cookies at 12 minutes. Oven can vary. Watch for golden edges. Remove when still soft in middles."
- "For a crunch, sprinkle sugar on top. Adds texture contrast. Just before baking. Not needed. Chewy texture shines on its own."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different flours? a: Yes. Play with gluten-free options. Almond flour works. Adjust baking powder too. Check moisture."
- "q: What if dough is too sticky? a: Use more flour slowly. Dough should hold shape. But don’t overdo it. Keep it chewy, not firm."
- "q: How to store cookies? a: Keep at room temp. Airtight container works. Freeze for long-term. Just thaw before serving."
- "q: Can I omit spices? a: Sure but flavor dims. Try vanilla for warmth. Or add nuts for crunch. Explore different combinations."
