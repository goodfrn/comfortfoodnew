title: "Caramel Pecan Upside Down Cake"
slug: "caramel-pecan-cake"
description: "Caramel pecans sizzling in butter and syrup coat the bottom of a cast iron skillet. A rich, eggy cake batter spreads over the glossy top to bake into a golden crust. Flip it out warm so caramel sauce and toasted nuts dribble down the sides. The nuttiness, the sticky sweetness, the dense yet tender crumb. A playful twist swaps golden syrup for maple syrup, adding deeper warmth. Adjust your skillet size if you must or place a pan below to catch drips. Watch for bubbling caramel, crackled edges, and cake that springs back to touch. A rustic showstopper that holds up to busy kitchens and hungry crowds."

ingredients:
- "1 cup unsalted butter divided"
- "3/4 cup packed light brown sugar"
- "3 tablespoons pure maple syrup"
- "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 1/2 cups pecan halves"
- "1 box yellow cake mix"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1 1/4 cups water"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 320 degrees F. Heat well-seasoned 10-inch cast iron pan over medium-low until butter melts and sugar dissolves in it with maple syrup, salt, and pecans. Stir frequently. Once caramel bubbles and pecans start to toast, remove from heat. You want glossy sauce that’s thickened but not burnt."
- "Melt remaining 1/2 cup butter separately. In large bowl mix melted butter, cake mix, eggs, and water briskly for about 2 minutes—too short and batter won’t rise right, too long and it gets tough. Pour batter evenly atop caramel pecan base, look for smooth spread covering all nuts. Slide skillet in oven and bake 50-55 minutes. Watch edges—they darken first. Cake should feel springy and golden, test center with toothpick; a few moist crumbs ok, raw batter no."
- "Cool cake about 12 minutes on wire rack. When still warm but not hot, place large plate over skillet and flip quickly but careful—skillet retains heat and caramel sauce bubbles. Pudgy sticky pecans coat top now. Use spatula for any lost nuts from skillet. Best served warm with vanilla ice cream. Cake texture dense, sticky, nutty. Will keep loosely covered day or two but loses crisp edges."
introduction: "Heat, wait, sizzle. Pecans crackle in bubbling caramel melting in butter. The kitchen fills with that deep sweet smell—the closest you get to candy without a thermometer. I’ve tried golden syrup but swapped it here for maple syrup; more robust, less cloying. Skillet matters too. Cast iron, well-seasoned, keeps heat steady, spreads caramel evenly. Mix batter last, don’t overwork it else crumb stiffens. The cake’s not subtle—sticky, nutty, sweet, with a crispy edge you recognize by its darkened hue and smell. Flipping takes nerve but is crucial—warm, not hot. Plate ready, quick flip, glistening pecans tumble down. No fancy tools, just instincts and eyes. If it drips in the oven, a sheet pan under saves cleanup. Timing varies by oven. Watch, smell, touch. Trust that. Makes all the difference."
ingredientsNote: "Butter’s split—half for caramel sauce, half melted into batter. Unsalted best, so you control salt precisely. Maple syrup swaps traditional corn syrup or honey here; richer, less intensely sweet, and brings deeper aroma. Brown sugar needs packing; it adds moisture and molasses notes. Pecans must be fresh and halved for texture and bite. Cake mix provides convenience but can be swapped for homemade yellow cake batter if preferred. Eggs standard large size. Water amount adjusted to keep batter loose enough for cast iron to soak in without overflow—this skillet’s size critical; if smaller, reduce liquid slightly. Salt sprinkled in caramel base draws out flavors and balances sweetness. You can dust the top with flaky salt after flipping for sharp contrast. Extra pecans can be toasted alongside but watch closely or they burn fast."
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven slightly lower than box says to prevent over-browning caramel. The caramel coating step demands close watching—bubble size grows before caramel thickens; when bubbling slows and looks syrupy, that’s your cue. Stir often to avoid scorching sugar at pan edges—a quick burn ruins the sauce. When mixing batter, roughly 2 minutes vigorous beating forms emulsion trapping air, vital for rise; too long scrambles structure. Pour batter straight onto warm caramel pecans to meld layers but pour slowly to keep nuts in place. During baking, edges change first; when they darken to nut brown and center springs back, it's done. Cool briefly so caramel stabilizes before flipping; too hot and sauce runs everywhere, too cold and cake sticks. Use thick towel for grip and heat protection. Retrieve nuts stuck below carefully but don't scrape pan aggressively, risk losing caramel base. Serve asap warm. Cake's crumb denser near edges, softer toward center—texture reveals doneness better than clock. Always have baking sheet under skillet if unsure. Made this many times, saved kitchen many times."
tips:
- "Butter split helps control texture and flavor. Half in caramel base, half melted for batter. Unsalted best. Maple syrup replaces corn syrup when you want less sweetness but deeper aroma. Watch caramel bubbling; stir often or it scorches fast. Glossy but not burnt is the cue. Pecans toast right in caramel, flavor concentrated. Timing tight. Use medium-low heat only."
- "Flipping warm cake is tricky—skillet retains heat long. Not hot or sauce runs everywhere. Let it cool a bit. Use plate that fits skillet snugly. Thick towel helps grip skillet edge—prevents slips. Release stuck nuts gently with spatula. If syrup sticks, brush skillet edge carefully to loosen. The caramel sets as it cools; too cold means tearing, too hot means leaks."
- "Batter mixing is short. About 2 minutes brisk. Too fast or long scrambles structure and cake toughens, too short batter won’t rise well. Pour gently over caramel-pecan base, move slowly to keep nuts in place. Batter texture should be loose enough to spread evenly but not overflow skillet. Skillet size matters; adjust water if smaller pan to prevent drips and soggy edges."
- "Bake at slightly lower temp (320°F) than box recommends. Prevents over-browning edges before center cooks. Watch edges darken first to nut brown—signal cake near done. Toothpick test still needed; moist crumbs ok, no raw batter. Sound changes too, crackled edge sounds from cast iron better guide than timer. Timing 50-55 min depends on oven characteristics, element placement matters."
- "Extra pecans toast alongside if you want more crunch but watch closely or nuts burn fast. Salt lightly in caramel draws out flavors, balances sweetness. Can dust flaky salt on top after flip for contrast sharpness. Cleanup? Place baking sheet under skillet to catch drips and prevent oven mess. Caramel sauce bubbles but too intense heat ruins base quickly. Stir to spread heat evenly."
faq:
- "q: Why maple syrup instead of golden syrup? a: Maple syrup less cloying, deeper warmth in flavor. Golden syrup too sweet, thinner sauce. Swapping changes caramel texture slightly. Maple adds aroma not just sweetness. Works well with pecans because of nuttiness."
- "q: How to avoid burnt caramel? a: Low heat, medium-low is key. Stir often, watch bubbles size—big bubbles thicken quickly. Remove once gloss shifts but not too dark. Heat carries in pan after removal. If caramel burns, base tastes bitter no good. Alternatives are corn syrup or honey but adjust stirring and heat monitoring."
- "q: Cake sticks when flipping? a: Usually flipping too hot or too cold. Hot means caramel runs off, sticky mess. Cold means cake grips pan edges. Let cool 10-15 minutes after baking. Use thick towel for firm grip. Gently loosen nuts or edges with spatula first. Some stick is normal. If pan not well-seasoned cast iron, might stick more."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cake keeps loosely covered at room temp day or two without losing crunch too much. Refrigerate if longer but edges dull faster, texture changes. Warm briefly before serving to soften caramel. Can freeze slices wrapped well. Thaw covered at room temp. Flaky salt topping helps keep flavor fresh after storage."
