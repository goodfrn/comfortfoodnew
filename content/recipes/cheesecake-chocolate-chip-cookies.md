slug: "cheesecake-chocolate-chip-cookies"
description: "Blend flour mix with baking soda, powder, and cornstarch. Cream cream cheese and sugar till fluffy. Eggs and vanilla join the party. Powdered sugar folds in. Slowly mix dry bits and heavy cream. Mini chocolate chips tossed. Chill dough to tame it. Scoop cold dough, freeze 5 minutes to hold shape. Smooth balls, gentle press. Extra chips on top for good measure. Bake till edges brown faintly, centers soft but set. Cool on racks. Makes 24 chewy, rich cookies with a tangy cheesecake twist and melty pockets of chocolate chip goodness."

ingredients:
- "2 1/8 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "1/4 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp cornstarch"
- "8 oz cream cheese softened"
- "1/2 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/3 cup powdered sugar"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "3 tbsp heavy cream"
- "1/2 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips plus more for topping"
instructions:
- "Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, cornstarch in bowl. Whisk to blend, no lumps. Set aside."
- "Cream cream cheese and granulated sugar using mixer on medium speed. About 2-3 minutes till light and fluffy. Watch for lumps; scrape sides often."
- "Add vanilla extract and eggs one at a time. Beat until just combined. Rubber spatula scrapes edges thoroughly to avoid pockets."
- "Fold in powdered sugar. Beat on medium until fluffy batter forms. Looks airy, light. Don't overbeat or it separates."
- "Turn mixer low. Slowly pour in dry ingredients alternating with heavy cream. Mix till dough clumps but still soft, not dry or sticky. Stop mixing once flour vanishes."
- "Toss in 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Just fold. Overbeating crushes chips and changes dough texture."
- "Wrap dough tightly in plastic. Chill in fridge for about 30 minutes. Chilling firms dough, prevents excessive spreading during baking."
- "Heat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper."
- "Scoop dough balls—heaping tablespoon or cookie scoop. Space 2 inches apart on sheets."
- "Freeze scoop balls on sheets for 5 minutes. Cold dough means less spread, better shape retention."
- "Roll each ball quickly between palms to smooth. Press down gently to flatten tops. Sprinkle extra mini chips over each cookie gently."
- "Bake 9-11 minutes. Watch edges for first faint browning, firm but springy center. Aroma changes; from raw dough to rich cream cheese scent. Avoid overbaking, cookies keep soft."
- "Remove from oven. Cool on racks. Sets the texture, avoids sogginess."
- "Store cooled cookies in airtight container. Keeps fresh 3-4 days. Can freeze dough up to a week."
introduction: "Remember the first time cheesecake met cookie dough? Sneaky fusion of cream cheese lending tangy richness while chocolate chips melt in just right spots. Tried a dozen tweaks before landing here. Tried sour cream, gave too loose a dough; cornstarch helps set the chewiness without heaviness. Powdered sugar balances sweetness with creaminess; granulated sugar brings crisp edges. Mixing speeds matter: cream cheese too fast breaks it, too slow loses fluffiness. Freezing dough balls? Game changer. Keeps shape, gives edges a delicate chew. Baking? Less about minutes. Look for subtle crackles, smell. Don’t rush chewy cookie magic. Proven now. Trust instincts, watch dough signs. Throw in extra dark chips if you dare."
ingredientsNote: "Cream cheese instead of butter amps tanginess and smooth texture—softer bite. If you lack cream cheese, try mascarpone or ricotta for a lighter tang. Powdered sugar crucial for fluff; swapping with light brown sugar changes chemistry—okay but expect denser crumbs. Cornstarch is underrated, prevents toughness by regulating gluten. Flour type can shift chew—AP is safe, pastry flour yields tenderness but softer spread. Heavy cream adds moisture and richness; whole milk works in pinch but watch consistency. Mini chips for even chocolate distribution; use chopped chunks for bursts but dough behaves differently. Vanilla should be pure extract; imitation kills complexity. Chill time firms dough, helps handling and prevents wild spread. Skip chilling, expect flatter cookies and uneven bake."
instructionsNote: "Whisk dry ingredients first, no lumps to avoid gritty mouthfeel. Creaming cream cheese and sugar till fluff traps air, creates tender crumb—don’t skimp time, scrape sides to avoid grainy sheer. Adding eggs slowly ensures cohesion while vanilla lifts flavor. Powdered sugar folds in last to keep lightness, mix gently. Adding dry and cream slowly avoids lumps and tough dough; stop once just combined. Chocolate chips fold last to avoid breaking. Chilling dough essential—skip and cookies spread too much, flat, greasy bottom. Freezing balls before baking locks shape. Roll dough balls smooth for even rise. Press gently to avoid over-flattening. Watch baking time closely; edges faintly browned, centers soft but set. Too long yields dry crunchy cookies. Let cool on wire rack—heat continues cooking slightly, moisture escapes to avoid blob shape. Store properly or lose freshness fast."
tips:
- "Chilling dough is non-negotiable. Firms up fats and starch, slows spreading during bake. Skip it and cookies flatten, edges run wild. Wrap tight, don't let fridge odors invade. Thirty minutes enough but hour better. Freezing scoop balls on sheet for five gets dough cold inside; shape holds up in the oven instead of blobs."
- "Cream cheese temp matters. Too cold, lumps lurk. Too warm, runny mess breaks down batter. I let soften on counter 30 min; test by pressing finger, should yield but not melt. Mixer speed critical here—medium for fluff, low for folding dry. Overbeating breaks chips; underbeating gives dense, uneven texture."
- "Use mini semisweet chips not big chunks. Chips disperse evenly, melt just right pockets; chunks cause textural inconsistency, dough behaves differently—denser or crumbly. Powdered sugar in batter adds fluff and creaminess; if subbing light brown sugar expect denser crumb with different chew. Cornstarch stops toughness, regulates gluten; I never skip."
- "Watch baking, smells and look. Scent shifts from raw dairy to faint cream cheese and toasted sugar; edges just browning—tiny crackles under fingers. Centers still soft but set; poke gently. Too long? Dry, crumbly edges no give. Oven temps vary; test early start at nine mins. Use wire racks to finish cool. Heat carries bake further; don’t cool on sheet."
- "Rolling dough balls? Quick palms roll stops heat transfer. Press lightly to flatten tops, not enough to smash deflate rise. Extra mini chips on top create little crunchy pockets. Baking sheets need parchment or silicone mat—direct metal causes scorch or uneven bake. Layer sheets, then swap mid-bake if necessary for even heat circulation."
faq:
- "q: Can I use butter instead of cream cheese? a: Butter changes chew and flavor profile. Less tang, richer fat. Texture denser, less fluff in crumb. Mascarpone or ricotta also options but soften bite, lighter tang. Adjust sugar slightly for sweetness balance. Cream cheese critical for signature tang and moisture."
- "q: What if dough too sticky to scoop? a: Chill longer. Sticky dough means fats too soft or humidity high. If still sticky, lightly flour hands or scoop but don’t overdo flour or dry out dough. Sometimes fridge temp varies; adding a few minutes freeze step helps firm shape without dry patches."
- "q: Why do cookies spread too much? a: Dough too warm or underchilled. Fat melts early; edges run fast. Cornstarch missing? Gluten runs wild. Overbeating dough also breaks structure. Use fridge and freeze steps religiously. Baking temp can play role; lower oven temp drags spread time. Don’t crowd sheets either."
- "q: How to store baked cookies and dough? a: Cookies airtight container room temp for 3-4 days. Use parchment layers between stacks to avoid sticking. Freeze dough wrapped tight up to a week; thaw in fridge overnight before baking. Dough can bake straight from freezer but add few extra mins. Avoid moist storage; soggy cookies lose chew."
