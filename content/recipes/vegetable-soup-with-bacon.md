ingredients:
- "3 slices of smoked pancetta, chopped"
- "50 ml (3 ½ tbsp) olive oil"
- "450 ml (1 ¾ cups) rustic bread, cubed"
- "2 eggs, lightly beaten"
- "1 liter (4 ¼ cups) cold chicken stock"
- "3 carrots, diced"
- "2 stalks celery, diced"
- "1 small zucchini, diced"
- "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped"
- "200 ml (¾ cup) blanched green beans, cut"
- "Salt and ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat non-stick pan on medium, crisp pancetta in 15 ml olive oil. Add bread cubes, toss till golden. Remove and set aside."
- "In a small bowl, whisk eggs with 100 ml chicken stock, keep chilled."
- "In a large pot, warm remaining 35 ml olive oil. Sauté carrots, celery, zucchini, and garlic until softened, about 7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Pour in remaining chicken stock (900 ml). Bring to boil. Reduce heat, simmer 12 minutes or until vegetables are tender."
- "Transfer half the soup (about 500 ml) to blender, puree smooth. Return to pot."
- "Temper egg mixture by slowly stirring small ladle of hot soup into eggs, then gradually incorporate tempered eggs back into pot, stirring constantly. Avoid boiling soup after adding eggs."
- "Add green beans, warm gently for 3 minutes. Adjust seasoning."
- "Serve hot, sprinkled with pancetta croutons."
introduction: "Carrots, celery, zucchini. Garlic hits the pan next. Pancetta sizzles, crisping up with bread cubes. Crunchy bits waiting. Eggs folded in with stock, thickening without cream or butter. Puree half the soup for body, leave the rest chunky. Snap green beans add fresh pop, greener than peas. No cheese, no dairy, just texture and depth from pancetta and olive oil. Simmer slow but not too long. Stir carefully when eggs join. Heat controlled. Seasonal vegetables swapped in, keeps it fresh. A soup for light lunches or eve nibbles. Rustic charm but refined. Simple, balanced."
ingredientsNote: "Reducing pancetta to three slices keeps the smoky element but lighter fat overall. Bread cubes made from rustic miche or country loaf hold up well in oil. The substitution of zucchini and green beans replaces leek and frozen peas for a fresher bite and slightly different flavor profile while maintaining color contrast. Olive oil used generously, separating the frying steps ensures bread soaks up just enough fat without turning soggy. Eggs beaten with cold stock temper the soup, lending creaminess without any dairy additions. Everything is easily accessible in most kitchens."
instructionsNote: "Start with crisping pancetta, that renders fat and flavors the bread croutons at the same time. Watch the bread closely, it browns fast once oil is hot. Holding the croutons aside prevents sogginess. Vegetables are softened gently in remaining oil to build foundation flavors before stock joins. Simmer time shortened slightly to keep some bite in the veggies. Puree about half the soup for texture without total smoothness. Gradual tempering of egg mixture is key to avoid curdling. Never boil soup once eggs are added. Finish with fresh green beans heated just till warm, bright and crisp. Assemble and serve promptly to retain warmth and crunch."
tips:
- "Start crisping pancetta low-medium heat. Render fat slow. Watch bread cubes closely once added. Too hot? Burnt edges fast. Oil temp controls crunch. Remove croutons immediately. Keep separate. Soggy is easy if left too long in pan or covered. Use rustic miche or country loaf bread. Holds shape better than soft bread. Cube size around 2 cm best for even toasting."
- "Egg tempering requires patience. Whisk eggs with cold stock first. Add hot soup bit by bit, stir constantly. Prevents curdling. Don’t dump eggs in pot fast. Control heat under soup — off or very low after eggs join. Boiling breaks eggs into curds. Simmer veggies till soft but with some bite, about 12 minutes. Overcook, veggies mushier, texture lost."
- "Oil amount matters. Use olive oil in two stages. First in pan with pancetta, bread cubes absorb just right. Remaining oil for sautéing vegetables separately. Builds layers of flavor without greasy soup. Garlic added last in sauté step to avoid burning, keeps aroma fresh. Vegetables diced roughly uniform for even cooking. Keep green beans fresh and crisp. Heat only three minutes after eggs mixed in."
- "Blend only half soup volume. Gives body but leaves texture. Puree too much? Soup overly smooth. Keep some chunks for rustic feel. Use immersion blender or jar blender carefully. Avoid hot splash. Cooling soup slightly before blending safer. Returning blended portion to pot keeps warming step efficient. Season at early and final stages. Salt both saute and final soup."
- "Serve immediately after green beans and croutons added. Pancetta croutons soften fast if left in soup long. Crisp contrast is key. Use spoon to distribute croutons evenly. Garnish can be adjusted. No cheese or cream here — eggs add creaminess without dairy. Keeps soup lighter yet textured. Great option for light meals or starters. Adjust vegetable types seasonally for variety."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid curdled eggs in soup? a: Whisk eggs with cold stock first. Slowly add hot soup bit by bit stirring. Temperature control key. Heat off or very low when eggs in. No boiling after eggs. Timing matters. Patience needed during tempering."
- "q: Can I use frozen veggies? a: Possibly but texture changes. Frozen veggies release more water. Sauté less time. Blanch green beans if frozen before adding. Flavor and color might dull. Fresh preferred for crispness and vibrant look."
- "q: What if croutons get soggy? a: Separate croutons after toasting. Add just before serving. Keep dry on paper towel if waiting. Soggy means oil is soaked too much or sitting in soup too long. Toast bread till golden brown, not burnt, for best crunch."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Soup in airtight container in fridge. Best consumed within 2 days. Croutons separate, store dry in cool place or fridge. Reheat soup gently, add croutons fresh before eating. Some soup may thicken on cooling, stir in water or stock if needed."
