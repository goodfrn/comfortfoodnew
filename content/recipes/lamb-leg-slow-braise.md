ingredients:
- "1.1 kilograms boneless lamb leg"
- "5 garlic cloves, quartered"
- "25 milliliters (1 1/2 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 large red onion, roughly chopped"
- "200 milliliters (7 fl oz) dry sherry"
- "2 sprigs fresh thyme"
- "150 milliliters (2/3 cup) beef broth"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Position oven rack in middle. Preheat oven to 140 degrees Celsius (285 Fahrenheit)."
- "Using a small sharp knife, make several slashes in the lamb leg. Insert garlic pieces deep inside."
- "Heat olive oil in a heavy casserole over medium-high. Brown lamb on all sides until golden. Season with salt and pepper. Remove lamb and set aside."
- "Add chopped red onion to same pot. Sauté until soft and lightly caramelized. Add beef broth and stir to deglaze browned bits."
- "Place lamb back in pot, pour sherry over, and tuck thyme sprigs alongside."
- "Cover tightly. Transfer pot to oven and cook for 6 hours 40 minutes. Meat should be tender, almost shredding."
- "Remove from oven. Let rest covered for 15 minutes before carving or shredding."
- "Serve with creamy mashed potatoes or roasted vegetables seasoned with fresh herbs."
introduction: "Boneless lamb leg, slow cooked. Garlic tucked in slashes. Red onion adds sharpness replacing yellow. Dry sherry instead of wine brings a nutty twist. Thyme sprigs swapped in place of rosemary. Beef broth deepens richness. Low oven, long time. Lamb melts into itself. The kitchen smells heady. No fuss, just wait. Perfect for lazy afternoons. Cook once, serve multiple times. Thick gravy clings to meat and spoon. A rustic feel, old world charm but modern simplicity. Mash or roasted roots with fresh herbs. Keep it rustic, rough edges intact. A dish that fills rooms and tables. The ritual of slow cooking, the reward at the end. Lamb, simple ingredients, minimal steps, maximum depth. In every bite, tender flesh, infused flavors. Set it and forget it kind of luxury. Slightly less heat, slightly less time. A little twist but mostly tradition. Warmth on plate. Comfort in cooking."
ingredientsNote: "Boneless leg trimmed for easier carving and less fuss with bones. Garlic cloves cut into quarters instead of halves to spread more evenly inside the meat. Extra virgin olive oil keeps flavors bright but cut from 2 tablespoons to 1 1/2 to prevent over-oiling. Red onion for a sharper bite that deepens when caramelized, swapping out yellow. Dry sherry replaces wine, lending a dry but nutty character to the braising liquid. A splash of beef broth adds extra umami and body, rounded by fresh thyme sprigs instead of rosemary to soften herb notes. Salt and pepper balanced carefully before searing. Ingredients kept simple, focusing on layering deep flavors through slow cooking rather than complexity."
instructionsNote: "Start with moderate oven heat slightly higher than original to reduce cooking by 20 minutes yet keep tenderness intact. Slice garlic thin and insert deep into meat slashes so flavor permeates in the long braise. Brown lamb fully on all sides for color and caramelized flavor notes before removing to rest briefly. Sauté onions in same pot until translucent and browned in spots to build flavor base. Deglaze with beef broth, scraping stuck bits to dissolve into liquid. Return lamb, pour sherry evenly, and add sprigs of fresh thyme tucked neatly beside meat to infuse aroma. Cover tightly to lock moisture. Slow cook in oven 6h40m, checking tenderness near end. Rest meat briefly after to let juices redistribute. Serve hot with creamy mashed spuds or roasted veggies tossed with chopped herbs for freshness. No stirring during cook — let the oven do its magic. Keep it simple, flavorful, hands-off."
tips:
- "Slash deep into the lamb with a small sharp knife before inserting garlic chunks. This lets garlic flavor seep fully into the meat during long cook. Use quarters not halves to spread flavor more evenly throughout. Garlic should be fresh to avoid bitter taste after long braise."
- "Brown the lamb on all sides over medium-high heat carefully. This caramelization adds layers of flavor. Don’t rush. Take your time to get rich golden color. Remove before onions go in. This layering builds complexity in the final dish."
- "Sauté the chopped red onion until soft with some browned edges but don’t burn. The sharpness softens and darkens giving a slightly sweet depth. Swap yellow onion for sharper bite and stronger character. Deglaze pan with beef broth scraping stuck bits releases intense umami flavor into braising liquid."
- "Use dry sherry instead of wine for the braise because it adds a nutty, dry, complex taste. Pour evenly over lamb and tuck fresh thyme sprigs beside to infuse herbal aroma slowly. Cover pot tightly to trap moisture and ensure tender, fall apart meat after nearly seven hours in oven."
- "Keep oven temperature steady around 140 Celsius. Slightly higher than traditional recipes reduces total time by 20 minutes while preserving tenderness. Do not stir while cooking. Rest meat covered after cooking to redistribute juices before serving. Serve with herb mashed potatoes or roasted root vegetables for contrasting textures and freshness."
faq:
- "q: How long to cook lamb leg slow braise? a: Around 6 hours 40 minutes at 140 Celsius. Low and slow method. Check tenderness near end. Meat should shred easily. Slight temp tweaks can cut time slightly but risk toughness."
- "q: Can I swap thyme for other herbs? a: Yes. Sage or marjoram work well. Each shifts herb profile. Rosemary is stronger so replacing with thyme softens flavor but sage adds earthier notes. Avoid overpowering herbs to keep lamb main focus."
- "q: Dry sherry substitute? a: Use dry red wine but add teaspoon balsamic vinegar for tang. Sherry has nutty dryness. Wine alternatives lack that. Balsamic approximates tangy depth. Avoid sweet or cooking sherry types as they change flavor balance."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly. Refrigerate in airtight container up to 3 days. Can freeze for longer storage but texture may slightly change. Reheat gently in covered pan with some broth to keep moist. Avoid microwave drying meat out."
