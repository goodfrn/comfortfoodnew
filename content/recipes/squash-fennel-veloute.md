description: "Velvety butternut squash and fennel soup with hints of star anise and rosy pink peppercorns. A plant-based dish free from gluten, nuts, dairy, and eggs. Uses vegetable stock to deepen flavors. The aromatic fennel and squash soften into a silky texture. Star anise simmers gently to infuse subtle licorice notes. Pink peppercorns add brightness at finish. Parsley replaces fennel fronds for a fresh twist. Olive oil enhances mouthfeel. Roast paprika in butter for smoky depth instead of star anise. Pureed smooth, delicate, warming, balanced sweet and savory."

ingredients:
- "400 g (3 cups) peeled and cubed butternut squash (about 2/3 of a 1 kg squash)"
- "450 g (3 cups) fennel bulb diced (about 1 medium bulb)"
- "1 small onion diced"
- "50 ml (3.5 tbsp) olive oil plus more for garnish"
- "1.2 litres (5 cups) vegetable broth"
- "1 star anise pod"
- "1/2 tsp smoked paprika (powder) as substitute for star anise"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) pink peppercorns crushed for garnish"
- "Fresh parsley chopped for garnish"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Toss diced onion, squash and fennel in. Sweat gently until veggies just soften and scents rise ~12 minutes. Avoid browning, stir often. Onions should turn translucent, squash edges soften but hold form."
- "Add broth and star anise pod or smoked paprika if preferred. Bring to low boil; bubbles breaking surface slowly. Reduce heat to simmer. Cook uncovered for 25–30 minutes until everything is fork-tender and fragrant. Test with a skewer; should slide in with minimal resistance. Skim any foam or scum floating."
- "Remove star anise pod (or leave out smoked paprika). Transfer soup in batches to blender or process with immersion blender until velvety smooth. Thin with broth if too thick. Taste — adjust salt or add a touch of black pepper if bland."
- "For silkier texture, pass through fine sieve or chinois. This filters out fibrous bits from fennel skin. Not mandatory but upgrades mouthfeel."
- "Serve hot, ladle into warmed bowls. Sprinkle crushed pink peppercorns sparingly for bursts of peppery floral sharpness. Scatter fresh parsley rather than fennel fronds for a bright contrast — fennel fronds can be bitter if old. Drizzle with fragrant olive oil to finish."
- "If soup seems too sweet, a squeeze of lemon juice just before serving can cut richness. Conversely, a dab of butter or coconut cream adds depth if too thin or watery."
introduction: "That scent. Fennel and butternut roasting low and slow inside the pot. The sweet earthiness — oof. Not always easy to land the right texture with these two, but patience wins. The fennel softens into decadent silk, but if you rush, it’s fibrous and sharp. Pink peppercorns toss in surprise hits of color, crackling tiny pops of heat. Star anise was tempting but sometimes overpowers, so I swap it for that smoky paprika kick. Sometimes, I sneak a diced onion for depth; green tops are hit-or-miss, so parsley’s the safer bet. This isn’t a quick fix soup. It’s the slow simmer, the eyes watching, the nose taking notes. Every simmering bubble sings a different note. The kitchen hums with anticipation. The velouté thickens, and the moment it coats the spoon—magic."
ingredientsNote: "Measurement shifts cut squash and fennel quantities by about 30%, which I prefer to keep the soup light, not too thick. Adding onion brings subtle sweetness and rounds out the flavor profile — onions caramelize faster than squash, so chopped finely works best. Star anise lends peppery licorice but beware, it can dominate if left too long. Smoked paprika sneaks in warmth and earth instead; trial it both ways. Parsley is less dramatic than fennel fronds and doesn’t turn bitter with leftover storage. For oil, olive oil is classic, but you can switch to hazelnut or avocado for nutty alternatives—though watch allergies. Stock should be rich, homemade preferred; if using store-bought, pick one low salt to better tune seasoning later. If short on time, roasting the veggies before adding broth amps flavor immensely but skips that slow mellow sweat step."
instructionsNote: "Start on medium heat so vegetables soften rather than brown — essential for delicate fennel that chars fast. Stir often; patience beats rushing any day. Aroma shifts signal softening: fennel’s anise scent starts to bloom, and squash releases sweetness. Once broth hits, bubbles tell you when to reduce heat to low simmer — not flat, gentle pop and steady movement. Do the fork test. Too firm? Extra minutes. Too mushy? Stop immediately or risk grainy texture. Blending tightens soup, but be careful not to overblend, or texture can become gummy due to starch breakdown from squash. Sieving worth it if picky about mouthfeel; it removes peeling and stringy bits. Use fresh pink peppercorns crushed last minute — grinding early dulls punch. A final drizzle of oil wakes oil-soluble aromas, bringing depth to last bite. If soup cools after serving, gently rewarm — rapid heat kills silkiness."
tips:
- "Use medium heat when sweating onion, squash, and fennel. Too hot scorches, ruins subtle sweetness. Keep stirring to avoid browning and bitter edges. Watch onion turn translucent, squash edges soften but keep shape. Smell shifts signal readiness — faint anise, faint sweetness coming off veggies."
- "If star anise dominates, switch to smoked paprika powder for smoky earthiness instead. Add during simmering stage, let aroma fill pot but don’t let it overpower. Taste halfway through simmer; can tweak salt or pepper then. Don’t skip crushed pink peppercorn garnish — fresh, sharp contrast to mellow velouté."
- "Puree soup in batches, don’t overblend. Overprocessing breaks squash starches, gums texture. Thin with broth cautiously; thicker soup holds heat better but can feel heavy. For silkier mouthfeel, sieve through fine mesh or chinois. Removes fibrous fennel skin, stringy bits. Optional step if you want refined texture, otherwise skip safely."
- "Parsley replaces fennel fronds as garnish. Fronds can get bitter quickly, especially old stock. Fresh chopped parsley adds brightness, little bite without harshness. Drizzle olive oil last moment. Oil adds subtle richness, wakes volatile aromatics in pink peppercorns and faint star anise notes. Avoid using cold oil; room temp or slightly warmed works best."
- "If soup tastes too sweet, a quick squeeze of lemon juice sharpens flavor, cuts richness. Too thin? Add butter or coconut cream sparingly amid stirring. Both add body without muting spice or vegetable flavors. Roasting squash and fennel first boosts flavor depth but skips slow sweat step; different technique, try both ways for preference."
faq:
- "q: Why slow sweat veggies, not brown? a: Browning makes sharper flavors, harsher notes here. Slow sweat brings out sweetness and keeps fennel soft. Watch onions translucent, squash tender but not mushy. Aroma changes tell you when."
- "q: Can I skip star anise? a: Yes, smoked paprika is good swap. Adds warmth without licorice punch. Use small amount or it overtakes. Pink peppercorn garnish is key for brightness in either case."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Fridge works fine, up to 3 days. Stir well when reheating, low heat keeps silkiness intact. Freeze in airtight container; loses some fresh aroma. Add parsley fresh after reheat to keep brightness."
- "q: What if soup too thick or thin? a: Thin with broth bit by bit, or add cream/coconut cream if too watery. Too thick? Thin juices or broth help. Adjust salt after thinning. Sieving smooths texture, removes fibrous bits but optional."
