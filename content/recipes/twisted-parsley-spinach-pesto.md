slug: "twisted-parsley-spinach-pesto"
description: "A lively herby pesto combining blanched spinach and fresh parsley, with roasted pecans swapped for toasted walnuts for deeper flavor. Garlic and olive oil bind it all, making a rich yet fresh sauce. Blanching spinach briefly keeps vibrant color and cuts grassiness. Pulsing in a food processor creates texture, not paste. Salt and pepper balance the earthiness. Perfect slapped on crunchy bread, or spooned over grilled fish or buckwheat pancakes. Nut choice can shift personality here – walnuts add warmth when pecans weren’t on hand. A late garlic addition to avoid bitterness, and oil added gradually for control. A bit of lemon zest or juice brightens it up when it feels too dense. Storage under a thin olive oil layer prevents oxidation. Watch for watery greens—it’ll dilute. Press before blitzing, always."

ingredients:
- "45 g (1 cup) fresh flat-leaf parsley, including stems"
- "48 g (about 1 1/4 cups) baby spinach leaves"
- "55 g (1/2 cup) toasted walnuts"
- "90 ml (6 tablespoons) extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 small clove garlic, finely minced"
instructions:
- "Bring a pot of salted water to a rapid boil. Drop in baby spinach, swish gently, and remove once wilted bright green—about 20-25 seconds. Don’t overdo or leaves turn dull and slimy."
- "Transfer spinach immediately to a large bowl of ice water to shock. Crisp leaves, lock in color. Drain and squeeze firmly in your hands or wrapped in a kitchen towel to squeeze out moisture. Excess water ruins texture; pesto becomes watery."
- "Combine blanched spinach, parsley (stems and all for extra flavor), toasted walnuts, and garlic in food processor. Pulse a few times just to start breaking down the nuts."
- "With motor running, slowly pour olive oil in a steady stream. Watch texture—want a chunky but well combined paste, not oily soup."
- "Pause, scrape down sides, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pulse a couple more times to incorporate."
- "Taste. Add pinch lemon zest or a few drops lemon juice if it feels flat or heavy. This cut acidity brightens herbaceous notes."
- "Transfer pesto to container. Drizzle thin layer olive oil on top, seals from air, keeps pesto vivid verdant green. Refrigerate if using later; best within 3 days."
- "Serve slathered on toasted crostini, dolloped over pan-seared fish, or spooned on hearty buckwheat crepes. Crunchy nuts and garlicky herb punch create mouthwatering contrast."
introduction: "No pesto like one fresh off the bat, but spinach throws a curveball—it loads up on water fast. Blanching’s not just ritual; quick dunk softens, preserves green and removes raw bitterness. I swapped pecans for toasted walnuts. They add earthier notes, more depth, and some occasional crunch in every forkful—pecans can be too sweet sometimes. Parsley’s included stems because anything discarded is lost flavor. Garlic minimal, finely minced, to avoid that acrid bite lurking in raw. I always add oil slowly, sensory control over slipping into oily sludge. Pesto should be vibrant chunks, not liquid glue. Lemon zest is my secret weapon—just a grating lifts the whole mix. Chill covered with a thin oil crust; oxidation dulls not just look but that fresh snap you crave. Used this on buckwheat galettes once, creating an herbaceous counterpoint that stunned. Techniques sharpened on repeated runs. Kitchen intuition trumps stopwatch here."
ingredientsNote: "Parsley stems aren’t just filler; they carry bright, fresh flavors you miss unless used. Baby spinach tends to have extra moisture, so blanch briefly—less than 30 seconds—enough to soften without collapse. You need to wring it well or the pesto runs thin. Toast walnuts in dry pan over medium heat until fragrant and golden. No wonder this intensifies the nutty aroma, adds depth. Garlic—less is more; too much garlic raw becomes harsh, especially pulverized. Adding it finely minced rather than whole cloves lets you spread it evenly without overpowering. Olive oil quality matters; cold pressed extra virgin gives brightness and richness. You can sub up to half the oil with walnut oil for nuttier notes. No pecans here but toasted walnuts add the crunch and warmth I've learned to crave after many pistachio and pecan tries. Don’t skimp on seasoning—salt and cracked pepper bring all elements together. Use freshly ground pepper; pre-ground loses bite. Lemon zest or a squeeze after blending cuts heaviness, giving lift without watering down. Peace of mind: pesto freezes okay if packed cold and airtight, but fresh’s always a winner."
instructionsNote: "Blanch spinach in plenty of rapidly boiling water with salt—salty water seasons leaves while cooking. Timing critical; watch leaves turn bright green, then fish out without delay to avoid limp mush. Immediately plunge into ice water to stop cooking—color stays vibrant, texture firm. Squeezing water is mandatory—think damp sponge, not dripping. Don’t rush blotting or pesto dilutes, flavor thins. Toss all greens, nuts, and garlic in processor. Pulse in bursts—don’t jump into all-at-once pureeing or you lose texture. Add olive oil slowly with motor running. Oil binds, lubricates blending, but too much too fast turns pesto oily and puddly. Scrape sides between pulses to ensure even mixing—herbs and nuts love hiding in corners. Salt and pepper last; helps gauge final balance. Lemon zest or juice added at the end brightens but avoid too much acid—pesto clumps. Store under olive oil film to limit air contact, which turns pesto brown and fishy. Makes sense to prep fresh each time but pesto holds up refrigerated for about 3 days. Over time, texture softens, flavor dulls. Works great on toasted bread, fish, or savory pancakes where the herbal punch cuts starch richness. My go-to kitchen hack: keep walnuts toasted and ready, batch blanched spinach for fast throw-together midweek meal. If greens feel watery even after squeezing, drain longer or lay on towel to dry. Garlic can be gently heated before blending if harshness worries you, but raw keeps freshness punch. The knife’s always in your court. Learned patience in texture rhythm, never blitz blindly."
tips:
- "Blanch spinach quickly not more than 25 seconds. Watch the leaves turn bright green. Steam time kills color and texture. Plunge ice water right after. Cold halts cooking, locks vibrancy. Squeeze out water firmly. Damp greens dilute, thinning pesto and ruining mouthfeel. Think wringing a damp sponge till just moist. Skipping this leads to watery sauce. Repeat practice to develop feel for exact timing and squeeze pressure."
- "Add olive oil with food processor running—steady slow stream. Too fast, you get oily soup. Texture change is your cue—chunky but well combined. Stop often, scrape sides with spatula. Nuts and parsley hide in processor corners. Pulsing keeps texture alive, not puree or glue. Garlic finely minced, never crushed whole cloves raw. High raw garlic burns taste buds, acrid sharpness. Toast walnuts dry in pan first; heat releases those nut oils, adds depth and aroma. Don’t skip this step unless nuts pre-toasted."
- "Lemon zest or few drops lemon juice comes after blending. Cuts heaviness without watering down. Citrus lifts herbal notes, brightens paste. Too much acid makes clumpy, watery pesto—add little at a time. Salt and cracked black pepper season last to gauge balance. Freshly ground pepper adds subtle crunch and bite missing in pre-ground. Parsley stems add hidden flavor here; stems aren’t filler. Toss them in whole, finely minced alongside leaves."
- "If pesto feels thin even after squeezing spinach, extend drying time. Lay greens on kitchen towel or spin longer in salad spinner. Moisture kills texture, flavor concentration. Garlic can be heated gently in oil before adding if bite too sharp. Raw garlic means freshness but harsh if overused. Use minimal quantities finely minced. Cold pressed extra virgin olive oil preferred for fruity brightness and body. Half oil can swap walnut oil for nuttier flavor, especially if richness feels flat."
- "Storage matters. Cover pesto with thin olive oil film on top. Prevents oxidation, staves off browning and off-flavors. Refrigerate in airtight containers; uses best within 3 days before flavor dulls and texture softens. Freeze in small portions if needed, sealed and cold-packed to avoid discoloration. Texture changes a bit but retains flavor mostly. When reheating or using from freezer, stir in thin olive oil layer again for freshness revival."
faq:
- "q: How long to blanch spinach? a: About 20-25 seconds max. Watch color shift fast bright green. Too long = dull, slimy leaves. Ice bath stops cooking instantly. No waiting, no guesswork."
- "q: Can I substitute walnuts? a: Yes, toasted pecans or even pine nuts work. Pecans sweeter, change flavor profile. Pine nuts bring creamy texture but pricier. Toast nuts dry for best aroma before blending. Avoid raw nuts unless crunch wanted."
- "q: Why is my pesto watery? a: Most likely too much moisture from unpressed spinach. Squeeze firmly or dry longer on towels. Water dilutes oils and flavors. Also check if too much lemon juice or acid added. Try thicker nuts or less oil fast added."
- "q: How to store leftover pesto? a: Refrigerate in sealed jar. Top with thin olive oil layer to block air. Keeps vibrant 2-3 days. Freeze in small containers for month(s). Defrost slowly, stir in fresh oil afterward. Avoid metal lids touching pesto to prevent discoloration."
