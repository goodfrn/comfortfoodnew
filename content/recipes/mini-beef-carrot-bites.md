ingredients:
- "20 ml sliced whole wheat bread cubes, crust removed"
- "25 ml milk"
- "475 g lean ground beef"
- "1 medium parsnip, peeled and coarsely chopped"
- "1 small celery stalk, chopped"
- "1 garlic clove, minced"
- "1 large egg, lightly beaten"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to broil setting. Cover two baking sheets with foil and set aside."
- "Soak bread cubes in milk in a large bowl for 7 minutes until fully moistened."
- "Pulse parsnip and celery in food processor until finely chopped. Add to bread mixture."
- "Season with salt and pepper. Add ground beef, garlic, and egg. Mix by hand until combined."
- "With oiled hands, form mixture into small balls using about 1 tbsp each. Arrange on sheets spaced apart. Should yield about 60 pieces."
- "Place one tray under broiler for about 6 minutes. Flip balls carefully, return for another 7 minutes until browned and cooked through."
- "Repeat for second tray after first is done. Rest briefly. Serve with mustard-mayo or herb sauce if desired."
introduction: "Meatballs, but snappy, bite-sized. Crunch variations in texture. That’s why bread cubes, but soaked just right, tender but not mushy. Parsnip and celery swapped in—carrot’s sweetness replaced by earth and crisp aromatic celery undertones. Garlic punching through. Ground beef, lean but juicy still. The egg binds, glue and moisture. Small balls, little bites. No long simmering stew. Broiling - fast, hot, sings with the smell of caramelizing meat. Flip once, quick and precise. 5 dozen roughly. Good for appetizers, party munchies, or a quick grab on the run. Put sauce aside or mix oils and mustard for dip on side. Warm bites with a hint of bite from celery and a sweetness from parsnip."
ingredientsNote: "Swap carrot with parsnip for a nuttier, earthier flavor. Celery replaces leek for adding crunch and a slight bitterness, balancing richness of beef. Bread cubes should be small, crustless, soaked in milk enough to soften but not collapse. Milk quantity slightly reduced from usual to maintain crumb structure. Use lean ground beef to avoid excess fat in baking. Garlic finely minced for fragrance without chunks. Olive oil for greasing hands and light drizzle on baking sheets can prevent sticking and encourage browning. Egg size standard for binding; don’t overmix to keep texture airy. This combo favors freshness and quicker cooking than traditional meatballs with heavy breadcrumbs or soaked stale bread."
instructionsNote: "Prepare broiler early for steady high heat. Two foil-lined sheets allow batches without wash confusion. Soak bread but keep an eye on texture—too soggy leads to dense balls. Pulse parsnip and celery finely; coarse chunks bring uneven cook times and dense bites. Mix by hand, gentle - overhandling toughens beef. Oil hands lightly to prevent mix sticking and ease rolling uniform balls of around 1 tablespoon each. Spacing key, these need room to brown instead of steam. Broil about 6 minutes per side, give or take. Flip carefully, preserve shape. Watch cooking closely last minutes—don’t burn, but want golden, crisp outside and cooked through inside. Rest after baking, carry juices inside. Serve warm with simple sauces - mustard mixed with mayo, or chopped herbs in yogurt. Keep batches warm under foil if serving later."
tips:
- "Keep parsnips chopped small. Even size cooks better. Celery adds crunchy bits. Not mushy, right texture. Soak bread cubes in milk. Just enough to moisten. Too soggy? Dense bites. Oil hands lightly. Helps form balls easily. Small balls for quick cooking."
- "Use lean ground beef. Avoid excess fat. Keeps bites juicy, not greasy. Don’t overmix ingredients. Maintain airy texture. Garlic should be fine. No chunks to overpower. Broiler on high heat. Prepare it early. Consistent heat for even cooking."
- "Line sheets with foil. Easier cleanup and no sticking. Flip balls gently. Preserve shape when cooking. Space them out on sheets. Crowded means steaming. Watch closely while broiling. Last minutes matter. Golden brown outside, cooked inside, key."
- "Rest after baking. Let juices settle. Serve these warm, don’t wait. Perfect with dipping sauces. Simple mustard-mayo or herbal yogurt are great. Mix oils in sauce for flavor kick. More bites? Double the recipe for 10 dozen."
- "Use fresh herbs if available. Keeps flavors bright. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Personalize the mix. Add spices for variety. Cumin or paprika can add depth. Consider different veggies too. Carrot, onion, or even bell pepper works."

- "q: Can I use different meat? a: Yes, chicken or turkey works. Modify cooking times though. Leaner options get dry quickly. Watch closely when baking."
