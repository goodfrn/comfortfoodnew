ingredients:
- "=== Aioli ==="
- "1 egg yolk"
- "12 ml lemon juice (about 3 teaspoons)"
- "8 ml Dijon mustard (just over 1 1/2 teaspoons)"
- "1 ml salt (scant 1/4 teaspoon)"
- "1 small garlic clove, minced"
- "220 ml canola oil (just under 1 cup)"
- "Pinch pepper"
- "=== Vegetables and eggs ==="
- "300 g small ratte potatoes or new potatoes"
- "300 g small carrots (around 14 medium carrots)"
- "200 g trimmed haricots verts"
- "4 hard-boiled eggs"
- "Assorted raw vegetables such as fennel wedges, radishes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices"
instructions:
- "=== Prepare aioli ==="
- "Mix yolk, lemon juice, mustard, salt, and garlic in a medium bowl. Whisk thoroughly. Add roughly one-third of the oil very slowly, drop by drop, whisking constantly until the mixture starts to thicken. Slowly drizzle in the rest of the oil while whisking vigorously. Add pepper to taste. Transfer aioli to a small bowl, cover, and chill while you prepare veggies."
- "=== Cook vegetables ==="
- "Place potatoes in a large pot. Cover with water, add salt. Bring to a rolling boil. Simmer for about 12 minutes. Add carrots, cook 7–9 minutes more. Add haricots verts and cook 3 minutes or until vegetables are tender but still firm. Drain immediately and cool the vegetables under cold water to stop cooking."
- "=== Assemble platter ==="
- "Place the chilled aioli bowl on a large serving plate. Arrange potatoes, carrots, haricots verts around it. Quarter or wedge raw vegetables like fennel, radishes, cucumber, tomatoes, and add around the edges for color and crunch. Halve hard-boiled eggs and place among the cooked and raw veggies. Serve chilled or at room temperature."
introduction: "Potatoes. Carrots. Beans. Hard eggs. Crunch from raw bits. All sitting around a bowl of aioli bright with lemon and garlic. Slow whisking, oil dripping in. Creamy thick. Bright acid. The kind of starter that invites picking at. Sharpness of Dijon paired with mellow, rich oil. The cold vegetables contrast the creamy sauce. Soft textures meet crisp slices. It’s straightforward but satisfying. No fuss. Gluten free, dairy free, nut free. The garlic punch wakes the flavors. Pretty colors scattered with care. All chill until ready to dig in. Shareable. Casual. A veggie plate with a sauce that pulls it all together."
ingredientsNote: "Egg yolk creates the base for the aioli, emulsifying the oil and lemon into a creamy texture. Dijon adds a spark, cutting richness and balancing garlic’s bite. Canola oil chosen for neutral flavor but olive oil works if you prefer more fruitiness. Using smaller potatoes ensures quicker cooking and even texture. Carrots provide a natural sweetness, softened but not mushy. Haricots verts add a fresh green crunch and color pop. Mixing boiled vegetables with raw keeps the platter visually and texturally dynamic. Hard-boiled eggs add protein and creaminess making this more substantial. Salt in the cooking water seasons veggies from the inside out, but be cautious not to oversalt the aioli."
instructionsNote: "Slowly incorporating oil into the egg yolk mixture is key for a stable aioli. Too fast and it can separate. Whisk by hand or use a slow steady beat with a mixer, but watch closely. Cooling vegetables rapidly after boiling stops cooking immediately, preserving color and texture. Timing each vegetable addition ensures all finish just right—tight, not mushy. Arranging the platter with the aioli center keeps dipping easy and visually appealing. Toss raw vegetables of your choice for crunch and freshness. The dish should rest chilled allowing flavors to meld but can also be served shortly after assembling. Don’t overcook the haricots verts lest they lose snap."
tips:
- "Prepare the aioli first. Use a whisk. Whisk hard, mix well. Slow with the oil. Drip it in carefully. Or use a mixer. Watch closely. The egg yolk thickens it. Add salt. Taste occasionally."
- "Get the veggies ready while the aioli chills. Use fresh. Cut them into fun shapes. Keep colors vibrant. Don’t overcook. Timing matters. Chill them in ice water. Keeps crunch."
- "For the raw veggies, consider variety. Radishes for spice. Fennel for crunch. Cucumbers for coolness. Mix and match. Add color. Be creative. Balance. Keep textures lively and interesting."
- "Assemble the platter last minute. Freshness is key. Arrange cooked and raw veggies around the aioli. Place hard-boiled eggs evenly. Beautiful presentation matters. Colors should pop. It’s Instagram worthy."
- "Serve chilled or at room temp. Can sit out for a bit. Easy to share. Perfect for casual gatherings. Dipping is fun. Prepare ahead but not too far in advance."
faq:
- "q: How do I make a stable aioli? a: Whisking is crucial. Slow oil incorporation is key. If too fast, it separates. Emulsification matters. Keep mixing consistently."
- "q: What veggies work best for this platter? a: Use small ratte potatoes, haricots verts. Add carrots. For raw, think cucumber, radishes. Play with colors and textures. Variety helps."
- "q: What if my aioli is too thin? a: Add more egg yolk, whisk again. Emulsification failed? Try chilling. Keep mixing. Patience is needed. Thin aioli? Not ideal."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Yes, cover chilled in the fridge. Consume within two days. Check the aioli too. Freshness counts. Don’t let it sit too long."
