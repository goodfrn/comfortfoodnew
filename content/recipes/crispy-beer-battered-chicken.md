ingredients:
- "=== Marinade ==="
- "375ml dill pickle juice"
- "8g black pepper"
- "5g paprika"
- "6 chicken thighs, boneless and skinless"
- "3 chicken breasts, boneless and skinless, halved"
- "=== Coating ==="
- "320g all-purpose flour"
- "45g cornstarch"
- "6g garlic powder"
- "6g onion powder"
- "10g sea salt"
- "=== Beer Batter ==="
- "240g all-purpose flour"
- "5g baking soda"
- "500ml cold lager"
- "Canola oil for frying"
instructions:
- "=== Marination ==="
- "Mix the dill pickle juice, black pepper, and paprika in a glass bowl. Add the chicken pieces, covering thoroughly with the marinade. Let it sit covered in the fridge for 12 hours. Drain well before coating."
- "=== Coating Preparation ==="
- "In a big bowl, combine all-purpose flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, and sea salt. Make sure to mix evenly and set aside."
- "=== Frying Chicken ==="
- "Heat the oil to 170°C (340°F) in a deep pot. While the oil heats, prepare the beer batter. In a separate bowl, mix 240g of flour with baking soda. Gradually whisk in cold lager until the batter is smooth. Thicker batter will stick better."
- "For each chicken piece, dip it in the flour mixture, then into the beer batter, letting excess drip. Fry 3-4 pieces at a time until golden brown, about 12-15 minutes. Use a thermometer to check. Target 82°C (180°F) internal temperature."
- "As the chicken fries, place it on a paper towel-lined tray to absorb excess oil. Keep the fried pieces warm in a low oven at 90°C (200°F). Repeat for the remaining chicken."
introduction: "Fried chicken lovers. This one's for you. Juicy chicken, crunchy outside. Dill pickle juice adds zest. A touch of garlic and onion in the coating. It's all about the beer batter. Fluffy. Crisp. Great flavors. Easy to prepare ahead. Frying is the key. Serve hot with pickles. Makes for a fun meal."
ingredientsNote: "Dill pickle juice gives a tangy flavor. Choose a lager for the batter. Any cold beer works, but lagers balance well. Chicken thighs add juiciness. A mix of thighs and breasts provides different textures. Use cornstarch for extra crispiness. Make sure the oil is hot enough. That ensures a crunchy coating."
instructionsNote: "Start with the marinade. Marinate chicken well for best flavor. Prepare the coating and beer batter while waiting. Keep everything organized. Heating oil takes time. Patience matters. Monitor the temperature closely while frying. Ensure the chicken cooks through. Drain excess oil. Serve immediately for great results."
tips:
- "Marinate chicken pieces in dill pickle juice. Gives a tangy taste. Best if soaked overnight. Flavors soak in well. Ideal for tender meat. Keep covered in fridge. Drain before coating. Important step not to skip."
- "Prepare the dry coating. Mix all-purpose flour with cornstarch. Adds crunch. Garlic and onion powders give flavor. Sea salt elevates taste. Blend well, ensure no lumps. Set aside before batter prep starts. Stay organized while cooking."
- "Heat oil to 170°C for frying. Use thermometer for accuracy. Essential for crispiness. Too cold means soggy chicken. Too hot leads to burnt outsides. Maintain proper temperature during cooking. Fry in small batches. Essential for even cooking."
- "Make batter by mixing flour and baking soda. Gradually whisk in lager. Consistency matters. Thicker batter sticks to chicken better. Avoid too runny mix. Smooth texture desired. Helps create the light, crispy crust. Pay attention to details."
- "Fry each piece for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. Use thermometer to check internal temperature. 82°C internal temp is goal. Drain excess oil on paper towels. Keeps chicken crispy. Serve hot for best results. Pair with pickles, complements well."
faq:
- "q: How can I avoid soggy coating? a: Ensure oil hot enough for frying. Too cool means fried chicken absorbs oil. Always check temp. Use thermometer for best results. Avoid overcrowding frying pot. Helps keep coating crispy."
- "q: Can I use chicken breasts instead of thighs? a: Yes, but thighs are juicier. Mixing can provide varied textures. Breasts may dry out quicker in frying. Adjust cooking time for thickness. Monitor carefully and check internal temp."
- "q: What if I don’t have dill pickle juice? a: Substitutes include vinegar or lemon juice. Must be tart for flavor. Not exact but helps. Might change overall taste. Dill added enhances flavor. Adjust seasoning as desired."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Cool completely then place in airtight container. Keep in fridge for up to 3 days. Can reheat in oven. Helps maintain crispiness. Avoid microwaving if possible. Also, can freeze pieces for longer storage."
