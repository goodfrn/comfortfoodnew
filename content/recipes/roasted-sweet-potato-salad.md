description: "Chunks of roasted sweet potatoes teamed with tender-crisp broccoli and charred corn kernels. A vibrant combo of radishes and scallions tossed in a tangy, slightly sweet tangy dressing. Shredded cooked chicken folded in, with a bright sprinkle of toasted cashews and fresh herbs. Lime wedges add sharp citrus edge while a dollop of spicy commercial mayo brings creamy heat. Roasting sweet potatoes just right means soft inside, edges browning, a whisper of caramelization. Broccoli and corn quick-blanched then briefly marinated for brightness. Simple tweaks replace traditional ingredients with punchier alternatives for freshness and unexpected texture contrasts."

ingredients:
- "3 medium sweet potatoes cut into large chunks"
- "25 ml vegetable or sunflower oil"
- "180 g broccoli florets, chopped small"
- "150 g fresh asparagus tips (blanched)"
- "6 radishes quartered then thinly sliced"
- "3 scallions, thinly sliced"
- "60 ml spicy Thai tamarind sauce or homemade nuoc-cham"
- "150 g shredded leftover turkey or rotisserie chicken"
- "Spicy chipotle mayonnaise or sriracha mayo, to taste"
- "40 g fresh basil leaves with stems"
- "50 g roasted cashews roughly chopped"
- "1 large lemon, quartered"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack center. Preheat oven to about 205 °C (400 °F). Toss sweet potato chunks with oil, salt, and cracked black pepper on baking pan lined with parchment or foil."
- "Roast sweet potatoes about 18-20 minutes. Flip once halfway through, looking for golden caramelized spots plus tender give when poked with fork. If potatoes brown too fast, lower temp slightly. Remove when edges crisped but interior soft."
- "While sweet potatoes roast, lightly blanch broccoli and asparagus in rapidly boiling salted water for 1-1.5 minutes until just vibrant and tender-crisp. Cool quickly under cold water to stop cooking and preserve color."
- "In medium bowl, combine broccoli, asparagus, corn kernels (fresh or thawed and drained), sliced radishes, and scallions. Pour over tamarind or nuoc-cham sauce and toss gently. Allow to marinate 12-15 minutes. Stir once or twice. Sauce should coat but not drown."
- "Drain vegetables well. Add shredded turkey or chicken. Mix again gently to incorporate. This layering of heat and acidity wakes up the poultry."
- "On serving plates spread roasted sweet potatoes first, warm or cooled slightly. Drizzle chipotle or sriracha mayo over potatoes — amount depends on personal tolerance for heat and creaminess."
- "Top with marinated vegetable salad. Sprinkle chopped cashews and fresh basil leaves over everything. Use lemon wedges to squeeze vibrant tartness just before eating."
- "Note roasting times can vary depending on potato size and oven calibration. The sign to stop roasting? Skin slightly blistered, flesh yielding but not mushy. Marinate veggies just enough so they absorb some sharpness but maintain crunch."
- "This salad is flexible — asparagus swapped in for corn adds fresh green sweetness; cashews swapped for pepitas or mild peanuts for different nut oils and flavors. Basil can be substituted with mint or cilantro for a twist. Leftover poultry saves time but roast chicken or turkey from deli also works."
- "Avoid soggy veggies by draining well after marinate before combining. Leftover mayo can be thinned with lime juice or vinegar if too thick. Toast cashews for nutty aroma if desired."
introduction: "Roasting sweet potatoes until their edges blister and flesh softens reveals a complex sweetness that’s slightly caramelized—the smell alone pulls me back each time. Tossing those back-to-the-kitchen moments with crisp-tender broccoli and fresh asparagus gives a refreshing crunch that contrasts beautifully. I always throw in quick-blanched corn or switch it up with asparagus for different veggie notes. Marinading in a tangy tamarind or Vietnamese-style nuoc-cham sauce wakes the entire mixture up with a lively zip that cuts through richness of roasted tubers and poultry. The smoky kick from chipotle mayo? Unmissable—adds creamy heat and a hint of unexpected depth. Cashews toast to a dark golden shade, sharp in bite. Fresh herbs? Basil or mint, depending on mood. Improvisation keeps this salad lively every time."
ingredientsNote: "Handling sweet potatoes without peeling keeps more texture and vitamins intact; I personally leave skin for rustic feel but scrub well. Roasting temperature and time matter: too hot, outside chars before inside softens; too low, potatoes turn mushy and grey. Blanch asparagus or broccoli briefly then plunge into cold ice water—stops cooking, locks color, adds snap. Tamarind sauce variation makes a huge flavor difference: store-bought versions vary wildly in sweetness and salt so taste first. Cashews give buttery crunch but peanuts or lightly toasted sunflower seeds work as allergy considerations or budget substitutes. Chipotle mayo blends heat and acidity; if unavailable, mix plain mayo with smoked paprika and a pinch of cayenne. Fresh herbs elevate bright notes—basil, mint, or cilantro depending on preference."
instructionsNote: "Preheating and using a center rack in the oven optimizes heat circulation for even roasting of sweet potatoes. Toss potatoes evenly in oil and season well—undersalted potatoes are flat in taste. Flip them halfway through roasting for consistent browning. Visual cues: edges browned and some shriveled spots signal caramelization; soft test by piercing chunk with fork for doneness. Blanch broccoli and asparagus in salted boiling water, timing carefully to avoid limp texture. Shocking in ice water immediately stops carryover cooking and locks vibrant green color. Mix veggies with sauce in bowl, tossing lightly to distribute without bruising. Let sit just long enough for flavors to meld but maintain textural contrast. Drain well before folding in shredded poultry to avoid sogginess. Plating starts with warm potatoes for base warmth, mayo drizzled sparsely for cream and heat balance, then crisp veggies and fresh herbs layered on top. Sprinkle toasted nuts last for splash of crunch and final aroma. Lemon wedges aren't garnish—they’re key to balancing richness; squeeze just before eating. If pressed for time, roasting temp can be bumped by 10 degrees but watch for early charring. Mayo can be thinned with lemon juice to blend better over warm potatoes."
tips:
- "Keep skin on sweet potatoes for rustic texture and nutrients. Scrub well, don’t peel unless allergy or mushy preference. Roast at 205 °C, watch edges brown and crisp but inside soft. Flip once, listen for subtle sizzle changes, smell caramel, poke with fork to check tenderness. Too dark? Lower heat slightly. Too pale? Raise temp or extend time."
- "Blanch broccoli and asparagus briefly, one minute tops. Too long, lose crunch and bright green, too short, raw bite. Immediately plunge in ice water. Color locks, cooking stops dead, texture snaps back. Draining well prevents watery salad later. Corn optional, fresh or thawed and drained. Mix quickly but gently with tamarind or nuoc-cham. Let sit just enough to coat without sogginess; 12-15 mins works."
- "Shredded poultry folded in after vegetables drain completely, layering heat and acidity without watering down texture. Use leftover turkey or rotisserie chicken – flexible here. Mayo drizzle last, keep it sparse—too much overwhelms crispness and freshness. Chipotle or sriracha mayo both work but beware spicy threshold; mild can mix in if you want control."
- "Use lemon wedges last second, squeeze right on plate before eating to avoid limp salad. Adjust mayo thickness if too thick with lime juice or vinegar. Toast cashews separately until dark golden, smell nutty oily aroma, snap when cool. Swap nuts if needed: pepitas, peanuts, even sunflower seeds for allergy or flavor variation. Fresh herbs change mood: basil, mint, cilantro. Keep dry until serving."
- "Roasting temperature and timing varies wildly; small potatoes roast faster, watch for spots shriveling and crisping before entire chunk soft. Flip and check softness with fork. Signs to stop roasting: skin blistered, slightly shriveled, tender give inside, not mushy or gray. Marinate veggies for zing, avoid soaking too long or they lose texture. Drain well before adding poultry to prevent soggy salad."
faq:
- "q: How to know when sweet potatoes are done? a: Edges blisters, some brown spots, soft inside but not falling apart. Poke chunk with fork, slight resistance not crunch. Smell caramelizing sugars, sizzle slows down. Flip halfway for even roast. Adjust temp if burning outside early."
- "q: Can I swap vegetables? a: Yes, corn or asparagus swap easily. Broccoli can be replaced by other tender-crisp stuff but timing changes with density. Blanchtime critical to avoid limp texture. Radishes and scallions add sharp crunch but can omit or change. Herbs flexible too, change basil for mint or cilantro depending on flavor approach."
- "q: What if salad gets soggy? a: Drain veggies fully after marinating, this avoids watering down later ingredients. Shred poultry dry, mix gently. Mayo can thin out with lemon or vinegar if too thick but avoid mixing too early or too much moisture. Toast nuts fresh and add last minute to keep crunch intact."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep components separate if possible. Roast potatoes reheat better than cold, can microwave or briefly oven-warm. Salad stays fresher refrigerated for 1-2 days but loses crunch fast. Mayo or sauce mixed late helps with texture retention. Lemon wedges keep fresh flavor but squeeze only before eating to avoid limpness."
