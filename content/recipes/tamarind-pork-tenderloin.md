description: "Pork tenderloin marinated in a tangy blend of citrus, tamarind, and hoisin with a kiss of fresh ginger and garlic. Grilled low and slow to medium rare. Sauce reduced from the reserved marinade. Switches cassonade for honey and orange juice for pineapple for more brightness. Adds fish sauce replacing soy for deeper umami. Charred broccoli optional, smoky, crunchy. Technique focused on resting meat for juicy slices. Attention to caramelization and sauce thickness to avoid bitterness. Sensory cues replace precise times for foolproof grilling."

ingredients:
- "2 pork tenderloins approx 300 g each"
- "125 ml pineapple juice"
- "30 ml honey"
- "30 ml tamarind paste"
- "30 ml hoisin sauce"
- "15 ml fish sauce"
- "5 ml freshly grated ginger"
- "2 scallions chopped"
- "1 garlic clove minced"
instructions:
- "1. Combine pineapple juice, honey, tamarind, hoisin, fish sauce, ginger, scallions, and garlic in a glass dish or resealable bag. Mix well until honey dissolves. Marinate pork thoroughly, cover or seal. Refrigerate at least 1.25 hours or overnight for deeper flavor penetration. Longer marinade breaks down muscle fibers for tenderness but not mush."
- "2. Remove pork, discard excess marinade but keep liquid intact. Pat pork dry lightly with paper towel. Season pork with black pepper only; salt already in fish sauce."
- "3. Preheat grill high heat. Oil grates to prevent sticking. Create two heat zones: one side on low medium-low, other side blazing hot."
- "4. Sear pork tenderloins over hot zone 3–4 minutes each side until char marks appear and caramelization occurs, crackling sizzling sounds. Flip carefully to avoid flare-ups."
- "5. Move pork to cooler side. Close lid. Cook, rotating every 4–5 minutes to cook evenly, until internal temperature reaches 60°C (140°F) for medium rare. Dense texture starts firm but still springy to touch."
- "6. Remove pork from grill. Tent loosely with foil. Rest 10 min minimum; juices redistribute, avoids dryness."
- "7. While resting, pour reserved marinade into small saucepan. Bring to vigorous boil to kill bacteria. Then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer stirring often until sauce thickens to shiny syrupy consistency—takes about 8 minutes. Watch carefully—burnt sauce ruins flavor."
- "8. Slice pork crossgrain into medallions, juicy pink center should be visible. Plate immediately. Spoon tamarind glaze generously. Serve with grilled broccoli tossed with sesame oil and sea salt, quick char adds crunch."
- "9. Optional garnish with extra scallions or fresh cilantro for brightness."
introduction: "Tangy, smoky, a little sweet, a little tart. Tamarind's unique acidic bite with honey’s mellow sweetness and pineapple’s bright zing. Tried traditional orange and cassonade before—too cloying, too flat. Swapped in fresh pineapple juice and honey, much livelier punch. Fish sauce instead of soy richens umami, cuts salt sharper. Grilling low and slow after quick sear keeps pork tender, juicy, not dry slabs. Smashed technique learnt the hard way—overdo cooking, you get chewy rubber, under cooked and you risk food safety. Sauce reduction thickens just right to coat slices, not puddle or harden. I prefer charred broccoli alongside, adds fresh crunch, smoky bitter balance. Aromatics sharp but not overpowering. Like playing a tuning fork on flavors—balance essential. Sometimes learn more from failure than from perfect cooks."
ingredientsNote: "Pineapple juice a bright substitute for orange juice here, adds tropical vibrancy. Honey replaces brown sugar, better instant dissolve and gentler caramelization—avoids bitter burnt sugars. Tamarind paste important; some brands vary wildly in concentration—adjust quantity to taste, some need more. Fish sauce boosts savory depth unlike low salt soy alone. Fresh ginger/must garlic key for aroma and bite. Scallions split between marinade and garnish for layered onion notes. Pat pork dry to help sear properly; wet surface steams rather than chars. Can swap pork tenderloin for pork loin roast but watch cooking times longer. Marinade time flexible; longer tenderizes fibers but salty fish sauce can toughen if too long. Broccoli toss in sesame oil optional but adds welcomed toasted nuttiness. Store leftover sauce refrigerated, reheat gently. If no grill, use cast iron pan for searing and oven finish, cover loosely. Avoid plastic bags if acidic marinade reacts—glass recommended."
instructionsNote: "Stepwise: marinate fully to infuse flavors but never neglect drying pork before grill—wet pork won’t sear just steam. Establish two heat zones on grill critical: proper char forms at hottest area, internal cooking happens over cooler spot gently. Searing times volatile depending on grill wattage; look for dark roux-like crust, fresh caramel aroma, not burnt black. Moving pork to indirect heat prevents exterior drying before center cooks with residual heat. Internal temp paramount: 60°C medium rare juicy, goes up to 65 for medium. Resting essential; cutting too soon loses juices, dry slices. Sauce: boil marinade separately to neutralize raw meat bacteria—don’t skip. Reduce and stir often until thick silky coat. Watch this; sudden caramel burnt smell means toss batch, start over. Use residual heat for broccoli or toss briefly on grill after pork. All steps flexible; sensory awareness beats timers alone. Ideas tempting but improvise, trust senses, always taste and adjust."
tips:
- "Marinate pork minimum 1 hour but overnight breaks down fibers better; fish sauce salty so skip extra salt; honey dissolves slow, stir well. Glass or stainless glass preferred; plastics can taste off with tamarind acids."
- "Dry pork thoroughly—wet meat steams on grill, hex kills crust. Oil grates hot but lightly. Two heat zones vital; sear hot, finish medium low. Flip quick to avoid flames burning sugar in honey and tamarind mix."
- "Internal temp 60°C signals medium rare juicy slices; test by feel springy but firm. Rest meat 10 min loosely tented; juices redistribute or dry tough edges happen. Slice cross grain thin for tender bites."
- "Sauce thickening needs attention; boil first kill bacteria then simmer low and stir often. Sticky shiny coat marks doneness; burnt smells mean scrap batch. If thickens too fast, lower heat immediately avoid bitter notes."
- "Char broccoli quick over high heat tossed in sesame oil and salt; crispy outside, smoky taste. Optional but adds crunch contrast to soft juicy pork. If no grill, pan sear pork then oven roast indirect heat, watch temps close."
faq:
- "q: How long to marinate pork? a: At least 1 hour for flavor; longer tenderizes muscle but fish sauce saltiness builds; overnight safest for deep taste. Glass container better no plastic; acids react. Watch proportions, too long toughens."
- "q: Can I substitute pork loin? a: Yes but needs longer cook time; leaner, less juicy. Adjust grill zones, lower heat longer rest advised. Marinade stays same, texture denser though. Pan roast option works too, avoid drying."
- "q: What if sauce burns? a: Remove immediately, burnt sugar bitter destroys glaze. Start again reduce heat earlier, stir frequently. Use lower flame once boiling achieved. Backup: mix fresh marinade or add honey cautiously if too thin."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cooler airtight container fridge up to 3 days. Sauce separate better—reheat gentle, avoid microwave high heat or fast burn. Freeze pork sliced to keep texture but glaze might thicken intensely."
