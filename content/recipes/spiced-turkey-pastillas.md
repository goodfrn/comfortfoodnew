slug: "spiced-turkey-pastillas"
description: "Twist on North African pastillas with turkey, toasted almonds, dried apricots, and honey. Uses a warm blend of aromatic spices including cinnamon, orange zest, and a hint of smoky smoked paprika replacing piment de la Jamaïque. Uses phyllo dough or spring roll wrappers for crisp layers. Butter browns to golden, filling thickened with chicken broth and flour for creamy binding. Finished with powdered sugar dusted on top, balancing sweet-savory profile. A real test of patience but worth the layers of texture and scent."

ingredients:
- "=== Spice Mix ==="
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) ground cinnamon, plus extra for dusting"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) finely grated orange zest"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) ground ginger"
- "0.5 ml (1/8 tsp) ground turmeric"
- "0.5 ml (1/8 tsp) smoked paprika (substituted for allspice)"
- "0.5 ml (1/8 tsp) ground cardamom"
- "0.5 ml (1/8 tsp) crushed red pepper flakes"
- "=== Pastillas Filling ==="
- "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "70 g (5 tbsp) unsalted butter, divided"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) all-purpose unbleached flour"
- "220 ml (7.5 fl oz) low sodium chicken broth"
- "300 g (10.5 oz) cooked turkey, shredded"
- "60 g (1/2 cup) toasted sliced almonds"
- "40 g (1/4 cup) diced dried apricots"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) wildflower honey"
- "16 spring roll wrappers each 15 cm square, or 8 large phyllo sheets halved"
- "Powdered sugar for dusting"
instructions:
- "=== Spice Mix ==="
- "1. Toss all spices together in a small bowl. Keep sealed until use; aromas punchy. Smoked paprika swaps out allspice giving a subtle smoky warmth and depth."
- "=== Pastillas Filling ==="
- "2. Melt 30 g butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Toss in onion and garlic. Saute until translucent, edges start caramelizing - about 7 minutes. Aromas thickening, that’s your cue."
- "3. Sprinkle in spice mix, stir vigorously 1 minute to wake up the dry flavors."
- "4. Dust flour over, keep stirring another minute, cooking out rawness but don’t brown it too dark or the filling will get grainy."
- "5. Pour chicken broth gradually. Bring to steady boil stirring constantly so no lumps form."
- "6. Add shredded turkey, almonds, apricots, honey. Salt and pepper liberally. Cook gently 5 minutes until sauce thickens - filling should hold together but feel moist and sticky, not soupy."
- "7. Remove from heat, stir occasionally to cool slightly before wrapping."
- "8. Meanwhile, melt remaining butter until foaming golden, no burnt bits."
- "9. Lay two wrappers overlapping like a star shape on a flat surface, brush each layer with butter generously avoiding sogginess."
- "10. Spoon about 1/8 of filling in center. Fold edges over to enclose, pinch to avoid gaps, form rough round pastilla. Place fold side down on tray. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling."
- "11. Heat skillet over medium heat. Cook pastillas in batches, adding more butter as needed to keep bottom crisp. About 3-4 minutes per side until crust golden and crackling."
- "12. Drain briefly on paper towel. Dust with powdered sugar and a light sprinkle of cinnamon immediately. Serve hot; sugar melting into crispy buttery layers is the best part."
- "13. If phyllo sheets too fragile, chill wrapped pastillas 10 minutes before frying - helps keep shape intact."
- "14. Optional sub toasted pistachios for almonds, or swap apricots with dried figs for earthier sweetness."
introduction: "Cut corners on spice blend? Don't. It sets the whole dish alive. Every pastilla layer sings when spices hit hot butter with onion. Turkey, though lean, picks up juices from broth and honey. Crunch from toasted almonds breaks sweet fruit's chewiness. Spring roll wrappers dip and crisp differently than phyllo - experiment. The fold? Tricky. Lots of folds, more butter—no soggy backs allowed. I learned patience here; rushing kills texture. Sugar dusting—more than decoration. Melts with heat, teasing sweetness between savory bites. Airy, crispy, sticky all at once. If pastillas droop, chill or stack differently. Perfect crust equals crackling crunch. The aroma? Cinnamon and orange hint at winter nights, cozy and alive in the kitchen. This ain't fast food, but worth the wait."
ingredientsNote: "Subbing smoked paprika for allspice adds unexpected smoky undertones—try it. Apricots must be soft but not too leathery; soak briefly in warm water if too tough. If no turkey, chicken works fine but texture varies slightly. Butter crucial for browning; avoid margarine or low-fat substitutes for crisp layers. Spring roll wrappers cheaper and crisp faster; phyllo yields flakier pastry. Double-layer wrappers prevent leaks but too thick weights down pastillas. Toast almonds gently till fragrant, not burnt. Honey ties sweet and savory but balanced — too much overwhelms the delicate spices. If dairy-free needed, swap butter for coconut oil or vegan margarine but adjust heat to prevent burning. Flour thickens sauce but add gradually to avoid clumping."
instructionsNote: "Watch the onions closely to avoid browning too dark early; they provide sweetness but burnish bitters if pushed too far. Stir spices quickly in hot fat to bloom aroma—skip and filling stays flat. Flour needs 1 full minute cooking to remove raw taste; too long, pastillas dry out. Add broth steadily, stirring constantly to prevent lumps—patience here saves cleanup. Filling texture should be sticky but not wet; too much liquid ruins wrapper integrity. Butter on wraps prevents sticks and crisps edges; no skimping or you get soggy messes. Keep pastillas fold side down while resting to hold shape; flipping prematurely splits pastry open. Fry on medium heat; too hot burns crust before center warms. Powdered sugar melts with heat, use immediately before serving—sprinkling too early leads to clumps. If filling separates, cool in fridge 10 minutes to stabilize starch and fat. Use tongs to flip gently; pastillas fragile until fully crisp."
tips:
- "Butter browning is key; watch it closely. Foaming golden signals right moment. Too dark means bitter edges. Use unsalted butter only; margarine ruins crisp. Double layer wrappers prevents leaks but heavy stacking weighs down crispiness."
- "Spices bloom fast in hot fat. Stir vigorously and only 1 minute so aromas pop without burning. Smoked paprika replaces allspice here—adds subtle smoky warmth without overpowering. Keep cinnamon for dusty sweetness; don’t skip orange zest for brightness."
- "Flour dusted over filling must be cooked at least a minute. Prevents raw flavor and grainy texture later but don’t brown it too much. When broth goes in, pour slowly, stir constantly to avoid lumps. Filling thickens slowly, be patient."
- "Wrappers layer like star shapes, brush each buttery or they'll stick and sog. Use spring rolls wrappers if you want crisper faster crust; phyllo yields flakier pastry but fragile. If phyllo tears, chill filled pastillas 10 minutes before frying to firm shape."
- "Sugar dusting goes on hot pastillas right at the end. It melts slightly into buttery crust adding sweet contrast. Sprinkling too early creates clumps; timing is everything. When flipping, use tongs gently to avoid breaks; crust cracks easily until fully crisp."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute chicken for turkey? a: Yes, chicken works fine. Texture slightly different, less dense but similar flavor base. Adjust cooking time slightly—white meat cooks faster. Keep seasonings same to keep spice balance intact."
- "q: What if pastillas soggy after frying? a: Likely not enough butter or too thick wrappers. Butter crisp edges, no skimp. Medium heat frying avoids burning crust before center heats. Too thick layers hold moisture and cause sog. Chill before frying if fragile."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container—best eaten within 2 days. Reheat in skillet on medium low to re-crisp edges. Microwave ruins texture fast. Can freeze before frying—wrap individually. Defrost chilled before cooking, fry as usual."
- "q: Can I skip smoked paprika? a: Smoked paprika adds smoky depth, replaces allspice’s warmth. If none, use regular paprika plus pinch cinnamon or ground cloves for complexity. Leaves flavor less layered but still good. Avoid too much chili powder; alters sweetness."
