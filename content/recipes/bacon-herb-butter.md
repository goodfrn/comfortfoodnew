description: "Smoky pork, fresh herbs, tangy mustard, and buttery base. Bacon scaled down slightly. Moutarde de Dijon swaps grainy mustard. Butter stays salted but quantity cut by 30%. Added fresh thyme and a pinch of smoked paprika for earthiness and heat. Bacon crumbled finer now, almost powder but not quite. Butter softened, mixed with herbs, spices, mustard, and bacon bits. Chill times tweaking to 15 min, cook times trimmed slightly. Butter cools, flavors marry, gets firm. Chunkiness from bacon, aroma from herbs. Serve dollops on grilled steak, roast vegetables, or crusty bread."

introduction: "Bacon and butter. Salt and herbs. Not fancy, just stripped down. Take down bacon quantity some. Make it about nuance, less pork fat, more flavors crisp and fresh. Moutarde de Dijon swaps old grainy seeds. Thyme and paprika walk in, smoky, dry, fresh all at once. Butter holds it all together, cold yet soft. Whip it rough, no hiding bits. Let chill, meld, thicken. Ready for corn, steak, or even just bread hungry. Quick work, under 20 minutes, you’re there. Crisp meets rich meets tang. Don’t overthink, just mix and serve. Texture and taste both loud. Something simple but layered, something that hits."
ingredientsNote: "Bacon reduced to two slices, fat trimmed or leaner cut if preferred. Dijon mustard replaces mustard with seeds for sharper tang but smoother texture. Butter quantity cut by one-third to avoid overwhelming richness; salted butter keeps seasoning consistent, no need to add salt elsewhere. Fresh thyme adds herbaceous aroma, a little green brightness. Smoked paprika gives depth and a subtle heat, not spicy but warming. Herbs and spices balanced so as not to dominate bacon’s smokiness. Ingredients minimal, designed for easy swaps: rosemary or oregano could step in for thyme; hot paprika if you want chili notes. Butter softness crucial to proper blending, room temperature but not melted."
instructionsNote: "Bacon cooked crisp in a dry pan, minimal oil, just its own fat rendering out. Let cool briefly on paper towel to avoid greasy butter. Chop or pulse bacon as fine as you can without turning it to paste. This creates a butter that spreads easily yet stays textured. Mix butter, mustard, bacon, herbs, and paprika thoroughly but quickly. Keep mixture cold, place in fridge at least 15 minutes to firm, flavors calm and meld. Serve cold or slightly softened butter. Excellent dolloped on hot food, melting in with smoke and herbs. Butter can be prepped ahead, stored in fridge, or frozen for longer shelf life."
tips:
- "Bacon crispness key. Use lean cut or trimmed to avoid too much grease. Cook in dry pan, no added oil to render fat naturally. Drain well on paper towels to keep butter from getting oily. Cool before chopping so bits don’t stick together or melt butter later."
- "Softening butter at room temp—not melted—makes mixing easier. Butter too cold breaks up; too warm turns greasy. Aim for soft but still thick. Mix bacon, thyme, paprika, mustard in quickly, keep bits visible, no puree. Texture adds bursts of flavor."
- "Chop bacon roughly then fine by hand or pulse in food processor. Avoid paste or mush. Chunky bacon bits provide crunch and bite inside butter. Fine enough to spread evenly but not lose crispness. Texture affects mouthfeel and spreadability."
- "Chill mix minimum 15 minutes to firm up. Cool solid butter holds shape, flavors meld. Too short, butter will be loose and oily, too long not necessary. Butter can be prepped ahead, stored in fridge, or frozen wrapped tightly. Softened slightly before serving."
- "Substitutions for herbs okay. Rosemary, oregano can swap thyme but changes profile. Use fresh or half dried herbs. Smoked paprika adds warmth without heat; hot paprika adds chili if wanted. Dijon mustard essential for sharp tang and smooth integration."
faq:
- "q: Can I use unsalted butter? a: Yes but need extra salt. Butter is base flavor. Salted butter adds seasoning naturally. If using unsalted, sprinkle salt gradually, taste before chilling. Avoid over salting or bitter spices may clash."
- "q: How fine should bacon be chopped? a: Chop until bacon bits almost powdery but not paste. Texture matters. Too coarse, butter less spreadable. Too fine, loses crunch and character. Use pulse function or sharp knife for control."
- "q: What if bacon is greasy? a: Drain well and cool on paper towel. Excess fat ruins butter texture. Greasy butter spreads badly, can separate. If too oily, add more cold butter or chill longer to firm. Better bacon cuts reduce grease."
- "q: How long can I store butter? a: Fridge up to 1 week safe, tightly wrapped to avoid absorbing odors. Freeze up to 3 months in airtight container. Thaw in fridge. Make in advance for convenience, but flavor best fresh. Keep chilled before serving."
