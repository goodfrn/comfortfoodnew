- "320 ml granulated sugar"
- "1 tbsp maple syrup"
- "1 tbsp milk"
- "=== For the coffee buttercream ==="
- "180 ml brewed coffee, strong"

instructions:
- "=== For the cake ==="
- "Preheat the oven at 170 °C. Grease a 42 x 30 cm baking sheet, line with parchment. Let paper hang over two sides."
- "Combine flour and baking soda in a bowl. Set aside."
- "Beat eggs and sugar until mixture is thick and pale, about 10 minutes."
- "Slowly add oil, and incorporate."
- "Fold in dry mix with a spatula until just combined. Spread into the baking sheet."
- "Bake for 18 minutes or until light golden. Turn onto a sugared parchment and cool."
- "Trim edges. Cut into 4 strips, about 41 x 7 cm. Wrap tightly."
- "=== For the buttercream ==="
- "Boil coffee and sugar until a candy thermometer reads 113 °C. Remove from heat."
- "In a bowl, whisk eggs and yolks until frothy."
- "Slowly drizzle hot syrup over eggs while whisking. Whisk until mixture is cool, around 15 minutes."
- "Gradually add butter, a few cubes at a time. Mix until smooth."
- "Spread half the buttercream on one side of each strip. Roll the first strip, place upright on a serving plate. Wrap next strip around it, repeat with other two."
- "Cover the top and sides with remaining buttercream."
- "=== For the meringue ==="
- "Reduce oven temp to 75 °C. Line two baking sheets with parchment."
- "Mix together confectioners' sugar and cocoa. Sift, set aside."
- "Whisk egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form."
- "Gradually mix in remaining sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in cocoa mixture."
- "Pipe meringue into a round disk about 23 cm on one sheet. Make about 40 sticks on the other, 6 cm long."
- "Dry meringues in oven for about 4 hours. Cool before placing meringue disk on cake's top. Attach meringue sticks around sides."
introduction: "Coffee. Chocolate. Simple layers. This cake has it all. A luxurious combo. Rich buttercream stands out. Light meringue contrasts. An experience in every bite. Great for gatherings. Sweet, not overpowering. Good with tea or coffee."
ingredientsNote: "Use high-quality coffee for better taste. Pay attention to egg temperature. Room temperature eggs whip better. Sift dry ingredients to ensure a light texture. Adjust sugar to taste if desired. The maple syrup gives a subtle flavor. Can substitute with honey for variation."
instructionsNote: "Cooling time for cake is crucial. Avoid folding too much to keep air in. Buttercream mixing needs patience. Ensure syrup isn't too hot when adding to eggs. Meringue must hold stiff peaks. Drying time is essential for texture. Each layer adds to the overall effect."
tips:
- "Use the best coffee. Strong brew enhances flavors. Quality matters. Sift dry ingredients. Gets air in mix. Eggs? Room temp is best. Helps with whipping. Extra tip, chill layers awhile before assembling. Remember cooling time is vital for lifting cake."
- "Meringue requires attention. Stiff peaks only. Don’t rush. Drying time for meringue is long. Up to four hours. Allow cooling before placing on cake. Layering strips makes a dramatic effect. Ensure each layer is smooth."
- "Buttercream mixing requires patience. Don’t rush adding butter. Gradual incorporation leads to creaminess. If too grainy, mix more. Syrup must cool before adding to eggs. If it’s too hot? Eggs could scramble. Watch temperature."
- "Trim edges cleanly. Helps achieve uniform layers. Wrap cake strips tight for better assembly. Avoid folding too much when mixing. Keep air in to maintain fluffiness. Sifting flour eliminates lumps. Cocoa adds richness but needs sifting too."
- "Avoid over-mixing batter. Can lead to dense cake. Each layer contributes texture. Make meringue sticks carefully. They’re decorative. Align them neatly for the best look. Cocoa is strong. A little goes a long way. Adjust sweetness of buttercream to taste."
faq:
- "q: How can I make this cake gluten-free? a: You can swap all-purpose flour with gluten-free blend. Measure correctly. Look for a brand with xanthan gum. Results vary. Experiment is key."
- "q: What if my meringue is too soft? a: Whisk longer until stiff peaks form. The key is patience. Cream of tartar helps stabilize. If slimy, re-whip or start over. Fresh egg whites matter. Room temp is ideal too."
- "q: How long can I store the cake? a: Room temp for up to two days, covered. Fridge increases longevity. But texture may change. Freezing is an option, wrap tightly. Consume within three months."
- "q: Can I use flavored coffee? a: Absolutely. Hazelnut or vanilla could enhance it. Each flavor adds uniqueness. Just remember, stronger the brew, better the taste. Test different varieties. Find what pairs best."
