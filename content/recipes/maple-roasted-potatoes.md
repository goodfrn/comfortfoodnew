ingredients:
- "14 baby potatoes, halved"
- "25 ml olive oil (1 1/2 tablespoons)"
- "3 garlic cloves, halved"
- "75 ml maple syrup (1/3 cup)"
- "6 ml crushed coriander seeds (1 1/4 teaspoons)"
- "6 ml crushed black pepper (1 1/4 teaspoons)"
- "70 ml roughly chopped pecans"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 185 °C (365 °F)."
- "Warm olive oil in an ovenproof skillet. Add halved potatoes, cut side down, and garlic pieces. Sear 3 minutes without moving until golden. Season with salt and cracked pepper."
- "Drizzle maple syrup over potatoes. Sprinkle crushed coriander and cracked black pepper evenly. Stir gently to coat everything. Shift potatoes so they lay cut side down again."
- "Place skillet in oven. Roast 30-35 minutes, stirring every 8 minutes, until potatoes give when pierced with a fork."
- "Remove skillet, scatter chopped pecans on top. Mix to combine, letting residual heat toast nuts lightly."
- "Adjust salt and pepper if needed. Serve with roasted meats or bitter greens."
introduction: "Small, waxy potatoes. Crunchy outside, fluffy inside. Maple syrup — sticky sweetness. Garlic perfume. Earthy coriander seeds cracked, sharp black pepper. Pecans — unexpected crunch, buttery notes. Roasting that blends sugary syrup with spices, caramelizing edges. Quick sear to start, then oven hugs them slow and steady. No dairy, no eggs, no gluten. Pure plant-based fare that works as starter or veggie side. Dark maple drips gloss, makes each bite glow. Crunch from nuts, pop from spices, softness of potatoes. Radicchio or meats, contrast is jazz. Serve warm. Eat fast. Simple, bold, rustic."
ingredientsNote: "Choose firm baby potatoes, preferably uniform size for even cooking. Smaller potatoes cook faster but watch timing closely. Olive oil lends fruity richness; other oils too neutral or heavy may change taste. Fresh garlic halves release pungent aroma, not too overpowering. Toast coriander seeds beforehand if you want deeper flavor. Maple syrup dark and robust preferred but mild works. Pecans are large and buttery, can substitute toasted walnuts or almonds for twist. Adjust spice quantities to personal taste. Can add pinch of smoked paprika for subtle heat or herb sprigs like rosemary. Keep everything prepped before cooking. Ovenproof skillet crucial for searing then roasting in one vessel."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating oil hot enough to brown potatoes on cut side in minutes. Don't overcrowd pan or potatoes steam. Garlic halves added early infuse oil, remove bitterness. Season well but remember maple syrup sweetens so balance salt accordingly. Pour syrup evenly, stir to coat potatoes without breaking skin. Use gentle tongs or spatula. Oven baking long enough to render starch soft, stir to prevent sticking or burning edges. Pecans last minute to keep toasted but crunchy, not soggy. Taste before serving, adjust seasoning. Serve immediately to enjoy texture contrast and warm sweetness. Leftovers reheat gently, lose some crispness but flavor stays intense."
tips:
- "Choose uniform baby potatoes. Heat oil well. Brown cut sides in minutes. Don't crowd the pan. Steam ruins the texture. Keep garlic halved."
- "Want deeper flavor? Toast coriander seeds first. Balance salt. Remember maple syrup sweetness. Adjust seasoning as needed."
- "Pecans add crunch. Add last minute. Keeps them toasty, not soggy. Stir gently to coat evenly. Use spatula, avoid breaking skins."
- "Roast until fork tender. Don’t forget to stir every 8 minutes. Watch closely, prevent burning edges. Flavor improves with care."
- "Leftovers? Reheat gently. Crispness fades but flavors stay intense. Use low heat, cover lightly. Enjoy warm and flavorful."
