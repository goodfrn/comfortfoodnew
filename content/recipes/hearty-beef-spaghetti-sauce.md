ingredients:
- "1 pound ground beef"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon pepper"
- "1 cup chopped onion"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "1 teaspoon Italian seasoning"
- "1/2 teaspoon dried parsley"
- "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes"
- "1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 teaspoon sugar"
- "1 teaspoon dried oregano"
- "1 cup hot water"
- "1 Knorr Tomato Bouillon Cube"
- "2 (15 oz) cans tomato sauce"
- "1 (6 oz) can tomato paste"
- "8 oz spaghetti noodles"
- "Optional twist: 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese stirred in at end"
instructions:
- "Heat large saucepan over medium-high. Drop ground beef in, use meat masher or wooden spoon to break up chunks. Cook until brown with some crust spots then drain out fat. Don’t rinse meat; flavor’s in that browned bits stuck to pan."
- "Add chopped onion, minced garlic, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, dried parsley, garlic powder, crushed red pepper flakes, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, and dried oregano. Stir all together. Cook stirring gently. Onions soften and turn translucent – should smell sweet and pungent, not burnt."
- "While onions go soft, microwave 1 cup water for close to 3 minutes until steaming hot. Toss Knorr Tomato Bouillon Cube in bowl. Stir until fully dissolved. A quick shortcut for a richer tomato base without opening cans or cans of stock."
- "Add tomato sauce cans, tomato paste, and bouillon water to saucepan. Stir thoroughly, bring to lively boil with bubbles breaking surface. Cover pot partially and reduce heat to low. Let simmer, stirring every 7-8 minutes. Thickens and darkens over about 25-30 minutes. Smell changes to earthy, deep tomato blend."
- "Meanwhile, boil a large pot of salted water for spaghetti noodles. Cook as package directs but test early. Should be tender but slightly firm to tooth. Drain well, no rinse unless you prefer cooler pasta for salad."
- "Finish your sauce with a splash more Worcestershire or pinch more sugar if tartness too sharp. For twist, fold in Parmesan cheese off heat, melts into glossy creaminess."
- "Serve sauce ladled on hot noodles alongside garlic toasted bread and crisp greens. Sauce thick enough to coat strands but still saucy, with flecks of herbs visible. Texture meaty, aroma rich with garlic and spices."
introduction: "Browned ground beef pounding out flavor from the start. Soft translucent onions sneaking sweetness in. Garlic and layers of dried herbs, smells that grab. Tomato bouillon cube? Game changer for quick intensity without added cans or stock fuss. Tomato paste thickening, tomato sauce sings acidity mellowed by sugar and Worcestershire. Simmering, bubbles popping, smell shifts to deep warmth. Cooking spaghetti noodles just right, not mushy but yielding. Cheese stirred in at the end, that creamy twist. Garlic bread crunch, fresh salad crispness completing plate. Sodium’s high, so cut back salt if needed. Simple pantry staples mostly except bouillon. Total time under an hour but watch sauce, it talks."
ingredientsNote: "Ground beef must be fresh or thawed fully to brown well; frozen meat steams and won’t crisp. Onion chopped medium fine for quicker softening. Garlic freshly minced beats powder here but dried garlic powder doubles down flavor. Italian seasoning and oregano replace each other; picked oregano for a sharper note. Red pepper flakes can be scaled or swapped for cayenne powder if preferred. Worcestershire adds depth and umami but soy sauce or tamari works if you lack it. Sugar cuts acidity, honey or brown sugar swaps fine. Tomato bouillon cube hydrates to strong broth; stock cubes or canned stock slow cooking can replace but less concentrated. Tomato paste rich and thick, must stir well to avoid lumps. Pasta quality impacts final bite; semolina or durum wheat brands hold texture. Parmesan optional but adds final richness, Parmesan rind dropped in while simmering is another trick."
instructionsNote: "Begin with browning meat to develop deep color and flavor; don't rush or crowd the pan or you’ll steam. Drain grease to avoid greasy sauce but retain brown bits stuck on pan—they carry lots of taste. Add all herbs and spices with onions; cooking them together blooms flavor, soft onions signal it’s time to add liquids. Dissolve bouillon completely in hot water before adding to prevent grainy texture in sauce. Stir tomato paste before adding to avoid clumps and uneven color. Simmer covered at low heat to concentrate flavors but occasional stirring prevents sticking or burning at bottom. Watch color and aroma more than timer; sauce thickens and darkens, smells shift to deeper tomato essence when done. Pasta cooks fast, test early and often to avoid mush. For serving, sauce should cling to noodles but not be gluey—too thick? Add reserved pasta water to loosen. Leftover sauce refrigerates well, reheats with splash of water or broth to loosen. Avoid prolonged boiling post-simmer to prevent bitter taste."
tips:
- "Brown beef first, no crowding pan or meat steams instead of crisps. Drain fat but keep browned bits stuck, that’s where flavor hides. Don’t rinse meat, or you lose that deep caramel aroma. Hot pan early is key, wait for sizzle, toss meat in chunks then break down with spoon quick to get crust spots."
- "Use dried oregano or Italian seasoning but not both; oregano sharpens while Italian herbs mellow. Garlic powder backs up fresh garlic if you’re short on time but fresh beats powder hands down. Stir herbs early in softening onions, smells change fast. Watch onions closely, once translucent stir you’re near liquid add time."
- "Bouillon cube dissolved in microwave-hot water cuts open-can fuss and adds instant concentrated tomato punch. Make sure fully dissolved or grainy bits show up in sauce. Stock cubes or canned stock work but dilute flavor. Stir paste well before adding to keep lumps from forming, uneven paste clumps ruin mouthfeel and color."
- "Simmer low, covered halfway so sauce thickens slow, stirring every 7-8 min keeps bottom safe. Color darkens and smell changes from sharp tomato to earthy blend, trust nose over timer. Watch for pan bubbling; too rapid a boil burns flavor, slow boil bubbles whisper welcome."
- "Pasta cooks fast, salt water well but test early. Tender but with bite is goal; mush ruins texture contrast. Drain deep, no rinse unless salad cold-prep, rinsing cools noodles and washes starch needed to cling sauce. Save some pasta water if sauce thickens too much to loosen with starch water, keeps sauce sticky but fluid."
- "Finish tweak: splash more Worcestershire if flavor flat, pinch sugar if acidity sharp. Parmesan cheese folded in off heat melts creamy, adds richness. Parmesan rind dropped early simmers out good flavor if you want longer cook. Garlic bread and crisp salad go well with thick herby sauce, texture contrast important."
- "Ground beef must be fresh or fully thawed, frozen meat steams not browns so lose texture. Onion chopped medium-fine cooks quicker, garlic freshly minced is key but powder is backup. Red pepper flakes kick heat but scale to taste, cayenne powder works too. Soy sauce or tamari swap Worcestershire in pinch, keeps umami alive."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid watery sauce? a: Drain beef fat fully before adding liquids. Simmer covered partially to concentrate. Stir often so no sticking. Avoid adding too much water or stock. Paste stirred well stops lumps. Let sauce thicken by smell and color not timing."
- "q: Can I use stock cubes instead of tomato bouillon? a: Yes but stock cubes dilute flavor more; may need less water or more paste to compensate. Bouillon cube stronger, less messy. Stock works but taste might be lighter, adjust seasoning after simmer."
- "q: Why won’t my beef brown properly? a: Probably crowded pan or meat frozen. Moisture released steams instead of browning. Dry meat well. Use hot pan, don’t stir too soon. Brown in batches if needed. Pat meat dry first to help crisping, fat renders out better that way."
- "q: How to store leftover sauce? a: Refrigerate in airtight container 3-4 days max. Freeze up to 3 months, thaw overnight fridge. Reheat gently with splash water or broth to loosen consistency; sauce thickens in fridge. Stir during reheat avoid burning bottom. Can also cool, freeze in portions for single meals."
