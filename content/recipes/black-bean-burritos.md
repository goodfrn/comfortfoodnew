ingredients:
- "=== Rice ==="
- "320 ml (1 1/3 cups) water"
- "140 g (2/3 cup) brown basmati rice"
- "0.75 ml (1/8 tsp) salt"
- "=== Pico de Gallo ==="
- "1 medium tomato, diced small"
- "1 small onion, finely chopped"
- "1 lime, juiced"
- "1 small jalapeño, seeds removed, minced"
- "=== Refried Black Beans ==="
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "25 ml (1.5 tbsp) vegetable oil plus extra for cooking"
- "1 can 540 ml (19 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) water"
- "=== Tortillas and Fillings ==="
- "2 ripe avocados, pitted"
- "6 large whole wheat tortillas"
- "140 g (3/4 cup) thawed sweet corn kernels"
- "90 g (3/4 cup) shredded sharp cheddar cheese"
- "25 g (about 3/4 cup) fresh cilantro leaves"
instructions:
- "=== Rice ==="
- "Start heating water with salt in a medium pot till it blinks boiling. Toss in the rice, stir once, cover tightly. Drop heat low. Cook gently for around 38 minutes. When all water evaporates, rice soft but grainy, remove from heat. Keep covered for 5 minutes — steam will fluff the grains just right."
- "=== Pico de Gallo ==="
- "While rice simmers, dice tomato and onion small. Mince jalapeño after de-seeding if less heat wanted. Mix all with lime juice. Salt and pepper. The sharp tang, fresh crunch, balance the beans. Set aside. Needs no cooking, let flavors mingle in bowl."
- "=== Refried Black Beans ==="
- "Heat oil in big nonstick pan, medium heat. Toss in garlic, cook stirring, smells fragrant, until soft but not brown, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat, add beans. Use a potato masher or back of spoon to crush beans roughly. Stir in water. Heat up until it bubbles, lower heat and simmer uncovered 5-6 minutes. Watch closely. When it thickens to creamy paste, grease shimmering on surface—stop. Salt and pepper here too. Keep warm."
- "=== Tortillas and Assembly ==="
- "Mash avocados in bowl with lime juice, salt, pepper. Should be creamy with some chunk, fresh green. Lay tortillas flat. No need to warm before. Spoon a line of refried beans down center, then layer avocado mash thinly over. Next, scatter rice, then corn, shredded cheese, and finish with pico de gallo and cilantro leaves. Fold sides over filling tightly, roll burritos away from you. Flip so seam side down for stability."
- "Brush tops with oil lightly. Sprinkle salt. Heat big pan to medium low, quiet sizzle. Place half the burritos seam-down. Cook gently, pressing occasionally, turning every 2-3 minutes until golden on all sides, about 12-14 minutes total. Avoid burning by adjusting heat. Repeat with rest."
- "Serve warm, those crackling toasty edges, with sour cream side optional. Great chill leftovers reheat dry; best warm in pan."
- "=== Tips and Tricks ==="
- "Swap cheddar for Monterey Jack or a smoky cheese. Use frozen corn if fresh unavailable, thaw first. Not a fan of jalapeño? Use mild poblano or omit entirely. Brown rice is slower to cook but more nutritious; quick soak rice 30 minutes to speed up if short on time. No potato masher? Fork or strong wooden spoon works. If beans get too thick, add splash more water to loosen. Tortillas tear? Warm briefly in microwave wrapped in damp towel to soften. Burritos hold best when rolled tight; loose ones fall apart during browning. Keep pan heat gentle to avoid burnt spots. Avocado turns brown if sitting too long; prepare last minute or squeeze extra lime juice. No cilantro? parsley or fresh basil adds nice herb lift."
- "Mastered the timing over many tries, learning rice doneness by sight—not just time. The rice should be tender but grains separate, not mushy. The smell when garlic hits oil is your green light to add beans. Thick bean paste that clings without sticking to your spoon means ready. The tortilla should crisp with golden freckles, no dark spots; adjust burner down otherwise. The avocado mash brings creaminess—don’t over mix or it loses texture and looks dull. Pico de gallo’s brightness brightens the toothsome burritos. The whole process takes patience. Rushing leads to underdone rice or burnt burritos."
introduction: "Brown rice has that slightly nutty chew missed in fast white rice options; worth investing time. While it simmers, chop and mix pico de gallo. That fresh acidity cuts through the richness of beans and creamy avocado. Garlic softens in oil first; don’t let it brown or it turns bitter. Crushing black beans yourself gives rustic texture—you want some tooth, not paste. Toss in some corn for sweet bursts. Tortillas get rubbed with oil, toasted slow on pan until just crisp, like a thin crust. Melting cheese adds punch and body. Burritos are a riot of temperature and texture when done right. Learned to watch by feel and sight, not clock. This hits satisfying and fresh all at once."
ingredientsNote: "Brown basmati rice cooks more evenly than regular brown rice but needs close watching. If in a rush, soak rice half an hour in cold water before cooking to shorten time. Freshness in pico de gallo depends on ripe tomatoes and crisp onions—no shortcuts there; avoid soggy or watery textures. Jalapeño gives heat but can be swapped for milder poblanos or omitted for gentleness. Black beans canned turbocharge the process but rinse well to reduce sodium. Oil choice matters—neutral vegetable oil works best to avoid flavor conflicts. Avocado should be ripe but firm to hold texture once mashed with lime. Whole wheat tortillas prefer slight warming or oil brushing for pliability and crisping without cracking. Corn adds sweet contrast and bursts of moisture; frozen and thawed works fine. For cheese, sharp cheddar gives tang but Monterey Jack or even vegan cheese can be swapped. Fresh cilantro is essential for herbaceous lift, no dried substitutes. Salt seasoning at every stage key—season rice water, beans, avocado, and pico separately to build depth."
instructionsNote: "Brown rice instructs patience, not stirring once covered—lift lid only after resting. Pico de gallo is quick; chop finely so it mixes well but stays fresh. Garlic softening in oil is critical—browned garlic ruins texture and taste here. Mash beans while still warm for the right consistency; adding water gradually lets you control thickness. Taste for salt before setting aside as beans thicken while cooling. Avocado mashed with lime juice turns creamy but protect from browning by preparing last or adding extra acid. When assembling, keep fillings centered and roll tight; loose ones leak filling and fall apart when cooking. Oil-brushing burritos gives crispness and prevents sticking; use just enough. Cook on medium low to avoid burnt spots; flip carefully with spatula, pressing lightly to brown evenly. Cook batches, don’t overcrowd pan. Serve immediately for best contrast of textures. Cooling leftovers? Re-toast pan side before eating to regain crisp edges. Don’t microwave—texture suffers."
tips:
- "Brown rice needs watching, not stirring. Wait till water vanishes, smell earthy nutty steam. Lift lid only after resting five minutes. That steam softens grains just right without becoming mush."
- "Garlic cooking scent signals when to add beans. Medium heat, bubbles should slow just before sour aroma turns bitter. Remove from heat before adding beans prevents burnt garlic bitterness ruining batch."
- "Mash beans while hot, add water slowly or paste gets gummy. Better thick creamy paste that clings without sticking to spoon. If too thick, splash water. Too thin, simmer a bit longer. Salt late, taste often."
- "Tortillas tear if cold or dry. Warm wrapped in damp towel briefly before filling. Or brush with oil before to soften and crisp without cracking. Roll burritos tight; loose ones spill filling when browning. Frequent flips and gentle pressing keep even toasted crust."
- "Avocado browns fast when exposed. Mash last minute or squeeze plenty lime juice. Chunky creamy texture keeps fresh, looks vibrant green. Overmix and dullness sets in. Cilantro essential, no dried substitutes. Parsley or basil if none."
faq:
- "q: How to know rice is done? a: Water gone first. Then smell, steam rises nutty. Grains tender but separate, no mush. Rest covered 5 min. Don’t stir till then or get gluey."
- "q: Can I use canned beans without rinsing? a: You want rinse well. Cuts sodium, less weird tin flavor. Rinsed beans mash better and taste cleaner. No rinse—taste flat, salty. Fresh beans possible but longer cook."
- "q: What if beans get too thick? a: Add water bit by bit while mashing. Or gentle simmer to loosen. Too thick means dry mash, won’t spread well. Thin out slowly—watch consistency. Fork works if no masher."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Wrap burritos tight, fridge up to 3 days. Reheat in pan to refresh crisp edges. Microwave’s faster but soggy. Freeze wrapped well, thaw overnight fridge. Avoid soggy by re-crisping on stovetop."
