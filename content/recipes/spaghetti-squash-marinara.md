title: "Spaghetti Squash Marinara Remix"
slug: "spaghetti-squash-marinara"
description: "Roasted spaghetti squash slices with a quick, garlicky tomato sauce, topped with aged pecorino and fresh oregano. Slightly altered timings, a hint of chili flakes for heat, and replaced basil with oregano. Olive oil swapped partly for avocado oil to boost smoke point and flavor complexity. A touch of rum added in sauce for depth. Cook till squash threads pull easily and sauce bubbles aggressively. A sturdy vegetarian starter or side to grilled meats. No nuts, gluten or eggs here. Rustic, hearty, satisfying with crispy edges and rich sauce melding."

ingredients:
- "1 spaghetti squash approx 1.3 kg sliced in 5 cm rounds seeds removed"
- "20 ml avocado oil"
- "15 ml olive oil"
- "500 ml hot spiced tomato sauce prepared with 3 cloves garlic crushed 1 tsp chili flakes 30 ml dark rum"
- "30 g grated aged pecorino romano cheese"
- "Fresh oregano leaves to taste"
- "Salt and black pepper as needed"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack middle position preheat at 210 C; hotter to speed roasting, watch edges."
- "Arrange squash slices on foil-covered tray drizzle avocado oil brush evenly salt pepper generous. Avoid pooling oil helps crisp edges."
- "Roast squash 38 to 42 minutes check doneness by stabbing thickest part fork or gently pulling strands from center. They should bend easily without mush."
- "While squash roasts prepare sauce in small pan heat olive oil add garlic and chili flakes stir 2 mins until fragrant not brown pour in warm tomato sauce add rum simmer low. Sauce should sing with bubbles reduce slightly thick."
- "Once squash tender remove from oven; let cool a bit so handling easier."
- "Using fork start shredding flesh inward towards center creating spaghetti strands leave some intact edges for texture variation. Don’t over shred or squash falls apart."
- "Place squash rounds on plates ladle 125 ml hot sauce gently in middle. Sprinkle pecorino and scatter oregano leaves generously. Serve immediately."
- "Optional garnish cracked black pepper flakes for punch."
introduction: "Squash roasted just right gives a satisfying snap then yielding tender strands almost like pasta—skip the boiling, no sogginess. I’ve learned to crank oven temp a bit, gets that slight caramelization on edges, adds nuttiness. Using avocado oil adds subtle buttery complexity plus better heat tolerance than pure olive oil. Swapping traditional parmesan for pecorino sharpens flavor cuts through sweet acidity without overpowering. The twist—throwing in chili flakes with garlic and splash of dark rum in sauce, it wakes up sauce with unexpected warmth and depth. Oregano replaces basil here; sturdier leaf won’t wilt fast and adds rustic herbaceous notes. Timing is flexible but tactile feel is everything for squash done perfectly. You want tender fibrous threads that pull easily, not mush or cracker dry. Toss this with grilled meats or keep fully vegetarian with crusty bread."
ingredientsNote: "Spaghetti squash varies in size and moisture; slice even rounds about 5 cm thick for even cooking. If smaller squash, adjust roasting time down. Avocado oil helps prevent burning while still giving nice flavor; olive oil alone can smoke at higher temps. Pecorino can be swapped with sharp aged grana padano or strong manchego, adding distinct character. Tomato sauce homemade or even good quality store-bought works fine; just punch it up with fresh garlic, chili flakes, and dark rum—don’t skip rum it’s subtle magic. You can replace oregano with thyme or marjoram if preferred. Fresh herbs vital here; dried won’t give same freshness or flavor pop after roasting. Salt and pepper adjusted to taste after roasting, as squash sweetens. If seeds remain, remove fully, they can add bitterness. Paper foil on tray speeds cleanup, also prevents sticking."
instructionsNote: "Roasting at higher than typical 200 C shortens time and promotes caramelization. Keep an eye towards end; edges will darken slightly but not burn — precise timing hits tender strands in center but crisp just under skin. Using fork fork to scrape strands outwards towards center is classic; do this while squash still warm but manageable, fibers separate best without crumbling. Sauce needs to simmer until fragrant and slightly thickened; use medium-low to low heat to avoid burning garlic. Adding rum at end of simmer rounds out acidity and bright tomato flavor. Assembly must be quick once squash ready; sauce cools fast otherwise. Sprinkle cheese while sauce still hot so it melts partially melting into threads blends flavors right at table. Basil is traditional but here oregano stands up to heat and roasting aroma. For cleanup, soak tray right after using foil cover to prevent hardened spots. You’ll find best doneness by piercing with fork; it should meet little resistance but not collapse instantly. If overcooked, strands fall apart too mushy; undercooked are brittle and stringy."
tips:
- "Roast squash slices 5 cm thick; too thin means dry strands, too thick slows cooking and keeps fibers tough. Watch edges darken but don’t burn. Use avocado oil because olive oil alone smokes at 210 C; switch ratios if needed based on oil availability."
- "When shredding, poke with fork gently while flesh still warm but cool enough to handle. Start at skin edge pulling inward, leave some strands intact for texture variance, prevents mushy mash. Don’t shred cold squash, fibers toughen and resist pulling apart cleanly."
- "Simmer tomato sauce low heat to avoid garlic bitterness; add rum at end for brightness boosting acidity and mouthfeel. Chili flakes wake sauce subtly but don’t overpower; adjust to taste or leave out for milder. Rum substitution possible with brandy or omit if needed."
- "Salt after roasting; raw squash is bland but sweetens with heat. Salt too early draws moisture out and can sog edges. Fresh oregano works best. Dried herbs lose punch and won’t stand heat well. Swap oregano with thyme or marjoram but aroma changes significantly."
- "Rest squash after roasting at least 5 minutes before shredding; fibers relax. Clean up’s easier using foil under tray; soak immediately as sauce and oil residue harden fast. If squash too wet, roast longer or drain strands on paper towel for better sauce adhesion."
faq:
- "q: How to tell squash is done roasting? a: Prodding thickest part with fork; should pierce resistance but flesh not collapsing. Edges lightly caramelized, crisp. Squash fibers separate when shredded. If tough, roast longer. If falling apart, overcooked."
- "q: Can I use another oil instead of avocado oil? a: Yes, olive oil works but lowers smoke point, watch temp. Light vegetable oils ok but alter flavor. Butter avoided due to burn risk. Mix olive and avocado oil to balance heat tolerance with taste."
- "q: What if sauce gets bitter when cooking garlic? a: Too high heat burns it fast. Lower temp, stir frequently. Add garlic after oil warmed but not smoking. Add chili flakes after garlic softens. If bitter, add a pinch sugar or extra rum to balance acidity."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, pack airtight. Fridge storage 3-4 days typical. Reheat gently to avoid drying strands. Sauce can freeze separately. Squash strands freeze okay but texture changes; better fresh or no longer than a week refrigerated."
