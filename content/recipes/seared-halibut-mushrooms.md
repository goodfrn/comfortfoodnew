Oyster mushrooms get a quick sauté in olive oil, seasoned, simmered briefly with chicken broth and thawed peas. Baby kale leaves wilt gently in the warm broth. A sprinkle of flaky salt tops it off. Quick cooking, protein and greens balanced. No gluten, no lactose, no nuts, no eggs."

ingredients:
- "4 halibut fillets about 140 g each"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "20 g unsalted butter"
- "180 g shiitake mushrooms sliced"
- "150 ml low sodium vegetable broth"
- "250 g frozen peas thawed"
- "150 g baby kale"
- "fleur de sel optional"
instructions:
- "Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add half the olive oil and gently sear halibut fillets flesh side up for 3 mins until lightly browned. Salt and pepper. Add butter and cook, swirling pan until butter turns golden hazelnut color. Remove fish, place brown side up on plate. Spoon browned butter over."
- "Wipe skillet, add remain olive oil, and increase heat to high. Toss in sliced shiitake mushrooms. Sprinkle salt and pepper, sauté 4 mins until softened and browned. Pour in vegetable broth, add peas and place halibut back, brown side up. Bring to boil then reduce to simmer 2-3 mins till fish is opaque and peas tender. Remove fish again."
- "Add baby kale leaves to hot broth and stir until just wilted, about 1-2 mins. Taste. Adjust salt if needed."
- "Divide greens and peas onto plates. Place halibut atop. Scatter fleur de sel over fish if using. Serve hot."
introduction: "Halibut, thick fillets. Seared crisp, browned butter. Mushrooms—shiitake this time—deep earthy flavor, quick sauté in olive oil. Peas sweet and bright. Baby kale swaps tatsoi; tougher leaf but a nice bite after a brief wilt in broth. Broth is vegetable-based instead of chicken, lighter here, still aromatic. Butter browned, nutty aroma, essential finish. Salt optional but textural pop. The process plays on textures and layering straightforward flavors. No frills, but honest. Under forty-five minutes, four plates. Something different yet familiar. Fish rich but gentle, mushrooms savory, peas fresh. Simplicity held tightly together by timing changes."
ingredientsNote: "Halibut instead of halibut requires shorter cooking times; reduce by about a third. Shiitake mushrooms replaced pleurotes for their firmer texture and deeper umami punch. Baby kale instead of tatsoi adds a slightly thicker green, robust enough to hold the brief simmer without turning to mush. Vegetable broth cuts down on animal stock, lighter and less salty naturally. Olive oil quantities adjusted to avoid excess greasiness. Butter reduced to 20g to keep richness balanced without overpowering. All measurements reduced roughly 30% except peas increased for better volume and color. Shelf-stable frozen peas convenient and add a pop of color. Fleur de sel optional but recommended for final seasoning crunch."
instructionsNote: "Start with halibut seared smooth side up in half olive oil, 3 minutes enough given fillet size. Butter added now, allowed to nut brown quickly. Fish out, baste with butter. Clean pan prevents mushroom flavor contamination. High heat sauté shiitake mushrooms in remaining oil, salt and pepper included early for moisture draw. Adding broth introduces liquid to deglaze pan, creates steam for peas and fish reheating. Simmer gently just long enough to cook fish through, about 2-3 minutes given smaller fillet. Fish removed again before greens added. Baby kale stirred into hot broth softly wilts but holds shape, keeps texture. Season done at end, finishing with flaky salt on fish if desired provides crunch and seasoning contrast. Serve immediately, no resting."
tips:
- "Sear fish flesh side up first. Keeps surface browned, skin side down can stick or tear if thin. Three minutes enough to get light color on 140g fillet. Use medium-high heat not too hot. Adds texture but prevents burning. Butter added after initial sear browns fast. Watch carefully, swirl pan. Nutty brown butter forms quickly and burns fast over high heat."
- "Wipe skillet before mushrooms. Avoid leftover residues mixing flavors. High heat for mushrooms gives good caramelization, deeper flavor. Salt and pepper early pulls moisture for browning. Broth added to deglaze, lifts browned bits. Peas added late so they don’t overcook but soften. Simmer fish again gently for just 2-3 mins, avoid drying or overcooking delicate halibut."
- "Baby kale used, thicker leaf than tatsoi. Brief simmer in hot broth wilts without mush. Stir gently, about 1-2 mins only. Helps greens stay vibrant and maintain slight bite, contrasting soft peas. Taste broth after adding greens, adjust salt if needed. Small pinch of fleur de sel on fish optional. Adds crunch and finishing texture contrast."
- "Butter reduced to 20g keeps richness without greasy feel. Halibut portion sized at 140g allows precise cook timing. Mushrooms sliced evenly for uniform cooking. Frozen peas convenient, add bright color and sweetness. Vegetable broth lighter than chicken, lowers overall sodium naturally. Olive oil split to control pan fat level when cooking fish then mushrooms separately."
- "Finish plating with greens and peas first. Halibut set on top to prevent sogginess below. Spoon browned butter over fish just before serving. Warm plates help maintain temperature but avoid resting fish too long. Fish removed twice ensures even doneness but needs quick moves to keep hot. Timing critical, work prep steps ahead like thawing peas and slicing mushrooms early."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other fish besides halibut? a: Yes but timing changes. Thicker fillets need longer sear. Thinner may need less than 3 mins. Adjust simmer based on fish opacity. White firm fish works best. Avoid oily or flaky types. Texture differs, so watch closely."
- "q: What if no vegetable broth? a: Water plus spices works but flavor flat. Add herbs, maybe garlic or onion powder. Mushroom broth alternate for umami boost. Low sodium broth preferred to control salt at end. Avoid salty store brands if adjusting seasoning yourself."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate fish and veggies separately if possible. Combine before reheating. Use airtight containers. Best eaten within 1-2 days for texture and freshness. Reheat gently; microwave or pan with lid, low heat. Avoid overcooking pea and kale—turn mushy fast."
- "q: Can I make this dairy-free? a: Butter is key flavor but can swap with vegan butter or more olive oil. No lactose raises slight flavor shift, less nutty. Browning vegan butter requires careful watch; burns quicker. Adds different mouthfeel, experiment with small batch first."
