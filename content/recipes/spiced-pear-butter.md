ingredients:
- "700 g diced pears peeled seeded"
- "25 ml lemon juice fresh"
- "50 g granulated sugar"
- "1 small cinnamon stick"
- "1/4 tsp ground allspice"
instructions:
- "Dice peeled pears. Toss immediately with lemon juice to prevent browning."
- "In blender or food processor combine pears, sugar, and lemon juice until mostly pureed with slight texture."
- "Strain puree through fine strainer or sieve. Press to extract smoothness."
- "Pour puree into saucepan. Add cinnamon stick and allspice."
- "Bring to gentle boil then reduce to simmer."
- "Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Simmer uncovered 1 hour 25 minutes or until volume halves and thickened."
- "Remove from heat, discard cinnamon stick."
- "Let cool slightly. Refrigerate uncovered until fully chilled and thickened."
- "Serve chilled on crackers, with sharp cheese or alongside rustic breads."
introduction: "Pears simmer down into sticky, flavor-packed butter. No fuss peeling dice, toss with lemon, sugar to balance sweetness and brightness. Citrus over oxides fast. Blend partially fine, keep some fruit texture. Cinnamon stick spices during cooking but allspice powder adds extra warmth. Long simmer thickens liquid into luscious spread, sorta syrupy but dense. Then cooling time thickens more. Can scoop onto bread or crackers with salty cheese or serve alongside savory olives. Pure vegan, gluten free, no dairy or eggs. Comfort food, slow burn, small jar worth of coziness. Makes a nice gift. Summer fruit preserved. Pared back basic ingredients. No fancy stuff needed. Just patience."
ingredientsNote: "Pears vary in juiciness so eyeball thickness mid-simmer and adjust time slightly. Lemon juice crucial to avoid browning, a dash will do. Sugar balances tartness; less or more depending on ripeness. Cinnamon must be a stick, powder alone loses aroma during long cooking, thus combined with allspice powder here. Cloves or ginger could swap allspice but changes flavor profile. This combo gives subtle warmth without overwhelming. Sieving smooth gives fine texture; keep seeds out. If chunkier preferred, sieve less rigorously. Organic fruit better as no wax skin. Adjust sugar kind - cane, beet or coconut all work but affect final flavor."
instructionsNote: "Peel pears thoroughly; fibrous bits tough and grainy if left. Dice same-sized for even cooking. Toss with lemon immediately to prevent discoloration; oxidation turns bitter. Blend til puree but don’t overdo — a few small chunks add texture. Sieve to remove fibrous pulp and seeds, pressing hard to extract max fruit body. Simmer uncovered to evaporate water, stirring keeps puree from scorching. Watch carefully towards end; too high heat burns sugars. Cinnamon stick infuses slowly, pull out before cooling. Let pure butter cool at room temp slightly before fridge to avoid condensation. Chill uncovered to allow thickening; refrigerate sealed after. Serve cold or room temp. Can rewarm gently if needed but not too hot or it thins."
tips:
- "Use ripe, juicy pears; check for tenderness. More ripe means sweeter. Try different varieties; they all change flavor profiles. Lemon juice is key for color. Keep a close eye while simmering. Stirring prevents burning. If it thickens too slowly, raise heat a bit. Keep checking thickness. You want it spreadable but not runny."
- "Consider adding warm spices like nutmeg or ginger. They boost flavor nicely. A splash of vanilla late in cooking can add depth. Keep the consistency moderate; too thick is hard to spread. If too thick, add a touch of water, stir while reheating. Let cool completely before transferring to jars. Avoid metal containers."
- "Chill before sealing tightly to avoid condensation. This can make it watery. Clean jars extend life; air-tight is best. Use sterilized jars, keep in fridge. Lasts a few weeks. Regularly check for any off smells or mold. Do not risk eating spoiled food. Label jars with date cooked."
- "Serving tips abound. Works well as a dip with crackers or on toast. Spread on savory biscuits. Pairs nicely with cheddar or blue cheese. A touch of salt contrasts the sweetness. Experiment. Serve alongside olives for a stunning platter. Fresh fruits can complement well also. Keep some texture in the spread."
faq:
- "q: How do I know if my pear butter is thick enough? a: When cold, should spread nicely on bread. Test a small spoon on crust. Should hold without running. If it drips, continue cooking. Check every 5 minutes."
- "q: What can I do if it tastes too sweet? a: A splash of lemon juice helps balance sweetness. Add gradually, taste as you go. Can also mix with other tart fruits. Or consider spices to mask sweetness. Try mixing with plain yogurt; creates good contrast."
- "q: How long does this last? a: Refrigerated in sealed jars, lasts up to 2 weeks. If using sterilized jars, can extend to a month. Keep checking for odd smells. If you see mold, discard."
- "q: Can I freeze this butter? a: Yes, freeze in small containers. Leave some space for expansion. Thaw in fridge overnight. Can be runny after freezing, mix gently before serving."
