slug: "chocolate-yule-log"
description: "A chocolate sponge cake rolled with orange-scented ganache and a rich cocoa buttercream frosting. Uses slightly less sugar and replaces orange liqueur with Grand Marnier. The cake includes almond flour instead of all-purpose for texture and flavor contrast. Frosting is creamier with added mascarpone. Preparation time slightly shifted, baking time reduced by a few minutes. The finished log is chilled then tempered for serving. A diagonal slice end-piece is attached as a decorative knot with frosting. Refrigerate and let sit at room temperature before slicing."

ingredients:
- "=== Ganache ==="
- "170 ml cream 35 percent"
- "120 g dark chocolate, roughly chopped"
- "30 ml Grand Marnier or other orange-flavored liqueur, optional"
- "=== Cake ==="
- "115 g all-purpose flour"
- "40 g almond flour"
- "5 ml baking powder"
- "4 eggs"
- "180 g sugar"
- "10 ml vanilla extract"
- "45 g unsalted butter, melted and room temperature"
- "=== Frosting ==="
- "230 g powdered sugar"
- "20 g cocoa powder"
- "200 g unsalted butter, softened"
- "60 g mascarpone cheese"
- "20 ml cream 35 percent"
instructions:
- "=== Ganache ==="
- "1 Heat cream gently in a small saucepan until just beginning to simmer. Remove from heat. Add chocolate, stir until melted. Add liqueur if using. Refrigerate for about 50 minutes until thick but not fully set."
- "2 Beat ganache with electric mixer until creamy and spreadable."
- "=== Cake ==="
- "3 Preheat oven to 185 °C (365 °F). Position oven rack in middle. Grease 38 x 25 cm pan. Line with parchment paper, grease paper. Paper should overhang sides for easy removing."
- "4 Sift flours and baking powder together. Set aside."
- "5 Separate eggs. Whisk egg whites until soft peaks. In another bowl, whisk yolks with sugar gradually, add vanilla. Beat until lighter and thick, about 6 minutes."
- "6 Fold dry ingredients gently into yolk mixture. Slowly fold in melted butter. Carefully fold in whipped egg whites last, preserving air."
- "7 Pour batter evenly into prepared pan. Smooth surface with spatula."
- "8 Bake 7 to 9 minutes. Toothpick inserted in center should come out clean."
- "9 Immediately after baking, invert cake onto a sugar-dusted sheet of parchment. Peel off baking paper. Using the parchment, roll cake from short edge while still warm. Cool fully rolled on wire rack."
- "=== Frosting ==="
- "10 Sift powdered sugar and cocoa together."
- "11 Beat butter until creamy. Gradually add sugar-cocoa mixture. Add mascarpone and cream, mix until fluffy and spreadable. Adjust cream amount if needed."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "12 Unroll cooled cake carefully. Spread ganache evenly. Reroll cake tightly."
- "13 Cut off a diagonal slice 2.5 cm thick at one end. Attach this piece on top of log as a knot with some frosting."
- "14 Spread remaining frosting on entire surface of the log, smoothing edges."
- "15 Refrigerate. Take out 30 minutes before serving to let it soften slightly."
introduction: "Chocolate sponge rolled, infused with orange hints. Ganache thick but spreadable, flavoured with Grand Marnier for depth. Cake lighter by folding egg whites last, almond flour added for texture contrast. Buttercream enriched with mascarpone, cream for softness. Baked just enough to set, rolled warm to keep shape. Diagonal slice cut for decoration, fixed like a knot using frosting. Keep refrigerated, but let come to room temp before slicing to avoid breakage. A holiday yule log, simple yet textural and with layered flavors. Mix ingredients carefully or air lost, cake dense instead of light. Less sugar than traditional recipes keeps it balanced."
ingredientsNote: "Flours switched up—almond gives nuttiness and adds moisture. Reduced sugar for a less sweet final product; sugar helps structure and browning so don’t cut it too much. Butter melted for smooth incorporation, but cooled so it doesn’t cook the eggs. Use good quality dark chocolate with about 70% cocoa solids for deep flavor in ganache. Orange liqueur optional, but recommended for aroma if you want twist. Frosting gets extra body from mascarpone cheese, replacing part of butter for creaminess without making it too soft. Cream in ganache and frosting is 35% fat for richness—don’t substitute with lower fat to keep texture right. Parchment layers greased to ease cake removal and prevent sticking."
instructionsNote: "Heat cream gently, stirring often once chocolate added to ensure smooth melted texture. Chill ganache until thick but pliable, important so it whips up properly. Folding dry ingredients into yolks requires gentle motion to keep air, critical for sponge rise. Whip egg whites separately to soft peaks, fold last for lightness. Rolled warm cake can crack if cooled too much before rolling. Baking times vary by oven accuracy; check early. Reverse cake immediately after baking onto sugar-dusted paper to keep outer surface moist and prevent cracking when rolled. Frosting preparation includes sifting sugar and cocoa to avoid lumps, adding mascarpone last to prevent overbeating. Attaching diagonal slice with frosting keeps presentation neat. Chill assembled log to set frosting well; serve slightly softened for easier slicing and texture contrast."
tips:
- "Use quality chocolate. Dark chocolate with 70% cocoa content recommended. It impacts ganache's taste significantly. Don't settle for lower quality. It affects the final flavor. Melting should be done carefully. Heat the cream just to simmer."
- "Sift flour and baking powder well. It incorporates air. Ensures lighter cake. Fold gently when mixing. Overmixing will deflate air. This cake relies on that airy texture. Treat it gently as you combine ingredients."
- "Be attentive while beating egg whites. Whisk to soft peaks. Pay attention to not over-whip. Gradually add sugar to yolks. It will lighten the mixture. Don't skip this step; it creates the sponge’s texture."
- "Rolling the cake warm is crucial. Letting it cool too much makes it crack. Use parchment paper while rolling. It aids in keeping shape. But don’t peel paper until fully rolled. Patience is necessary."
- "For frosting, use room temperature butter. Helps to achieve a smooth consistency. Gradually add sugar and cocoa. Mascarpone enhances creaminess. Adjust cream amount as needed. Simply mix until fluffy, but avoid overbeating."
faq:
- "q: How long does the Chocolate Yule Log last? a: Store leftovers in an airtight container. Can be kept in fridge up to 4 days. Best served at room temperature. If frozen, wrap well. Thaw in fridge overnight before serving."
- "q: What if my ganache is too runny? a: Chill it longer. Must thicken to spread. If still too runny, whip carefully. Adding more chocolate in small amounts also helps. A thick ganache layers better, set before assembling."
- "q: How to prevent cracking while rolling? a: Don’t let the cake cool too much. Roll while warm. Use enough sugar on parchment. Moisture matters, keep surface from drying out. Also, gentle pressure as you roll helps."
- "q: Can I use different flavors for this Yule Log? a: Yes, experiment with various liqueurs. Try coffee or vanilla for unique spin. Alternate frostings like cream cheese works too. Just balance flavors overall, taste matters."
