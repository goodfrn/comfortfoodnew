description: "Chunky, textured tomato sauce with fresh basil and garlic. Slow simmered to bring out natural sweetness. Simple pantry ingredients, friendly for substitutions. No blender needed, more hands-on tactile approach. Balances acidity with a pinch of sugar, shaken not stirred. Classic comfort, redolent of sautéed garlic, bubbling tomatoes and fresh herbs. Bright pops of fresh basil at finish, sprinkled at last moment. Thickens as it cools. Versatile—great on pasta, eggs, grilled chicken. Avoid watery sludge by reducing thoroughly.

ingredients:
- "1.9 kg fresh plum tomatoes peeled and roughly chopped"
- "4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil"
- "5 garlic cloves thinly sliced"
- "1 small onion finely diced"
- "1 tsp dried oregano"
- "1.5 tsp fine sea salt"
- "1 pinch sugar"
- "10 fresh basil leaves roughly torn"
- "1 tbsp red wine vinegar optional twist"
- "Fresh cracked black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "Rip tomatoes open by hand. No peeling skin stress; skin cooks down. Rough chop, don’t overdo it. Set aside."
- "Slice garlic thin—too thick, it burns; too thin, it disappears. Dice onion fine enough to melt into sauce later."
- "Tear basil last, keep fresh and bright, toss in near end."
- "=== Cooking ==="
- "Heat oil in heavy saucepan medium heat. Add garlic. Listen for gentle sizzle, not aggressive pop. Browning garlic = bitterness, so stay watching."
- "Toss in onions when garlic just starts color. Softening onion changes texture, aroma fills kitchen."
- "Once onions translucent, about 5 mins altering heat slightly, dump tomatoes in. Be careful; hot oil, unexpected splashes."
- "Add salt, oregano, and sugar now. Sugar cuts acidity without sweetness takeover. No sugar? Try a splash vinegar later to balance instead."
- "Simmer uncovered. Do not stir constantly; bubbles should break steadily, sauce thickening. Use wooden spoon to scrape bottom occasionally, prevents scorch."
- "After 30 mins, liquid thins slightly, sauce gains body. Give taste—acid still too sharp? Add vinegar now, stir, simmer 5 more. Pepper to finish."
- "Seven minutes before off heat, toss torn basil leaves. Stir gently; heat will bruise leaves if too hot or stirred rough."
- "=== Finishing and Storage ==="
- "Cool slightly, sauce thickens on standing. Taste again. Too thick? Thin with splash water or stock."
- "Use immediately or store in sterilized jars. Keeps for 4 days refrigerated, freezes well."
- "Reheat gently—high heat breaks down flavors."
- "=== Troubleshooting and Variations ==="
- "Too watery? Simmer longer uncovered. Too thick? Add broth or wine. Burnt smell? Rescue by adding fresh tomatoes or a tablespoon sugar to mask bitterness."
- "No fresh tomatoes? Use canned whole peeled; same method. Remove excess liquid from canned first to avoid diluting."
- "No basil? Use dried oregano or parsley but add after cooking; dried herb flavors cook differently."
- "Prefer spicy? Add pinch chili flakes with garlic step."
introduction: "Plopped tomatoes—no fiddly peeling. Chunky bits giving bite not mush. Garlic aroma sneaking up while onions melt; kitchen smells like a promise. Saw bubbling sauce turn deep red, thickening slowly. Basil tossed in last minute keeps that fresh snap, not limp green mush. Learned my lesson watching sauce scorch when distracted. Sugar balances tomato bite perfectly—no weird sweetness, just smooth depth. Vinegar optional, but a splash gave extra layer. Not just pasta; dollop on eggs or grilled meat. Simple, rustic but not lazy. Don’t overblend or over-simmer; texture matters, feel matters. My kitchen secret stash sauce, a riff on classic, soul in every spoonful. Embrace the cool-down thickening phase; patience pays off."
ingredientsNote: "Fresh plum tomatoes best but canned whole work too—just drain some liquid or sauce ends too thin. Olive oil choice matters—cheap ends bitter taste; good quality gives that fruity zip. Garlic sliced thin controls flavor release; minced goes bitter fast. Sugar cuts acidity; if you avoid refined sugar, try carrot grated fine or a little grated onion extra—natural sweetness. Dried oregano optional; use sparingly or it overtakes. Basil absolutely fresh, added last minute for that punch. If basil spotty, frozen herbs don’t do justice. Vinegar optional but adds brightness; red wine or sherry vinegar preferred; white vinegar too sharp. Salt—start less, add more last; tomatoes vary widely in saltiness. Pepper freshly cracked always beats pre-ground. Keep extras handy, add gradually after tasting."
instructionsNote: "Heat oil moderate heat; listen for gentle sizzle not pop. Add garlic and watch—browning poisons flavor. Onions next, soften fully until translucent; crucial for mellow base. Fresh tomatoes chopped, plop in and stir once. Salt, oregano, sugar now—season early but taste often. Simmer uncovered, bubbles small and steady—not wild boil. Stir occasionally but avoid constant stirring; scraping bottom key to avoid scorch but gentle is best. Finish with torn basil tossed in last minutes; bruise leaves results in dark flavor. Taste repeatedly; adjust acidity and salt late stage. Cool sauce thickens nicely; don’t rush. Store properly chilled or frozen. Reheat gently, high heat kills flavor layers. Troubleshoot watery or burnt problems by adjusting simmer time or adding fresh tomato. Kitchen patience crucial. Every stove varies, so watch not clock."
tips:
- "Rip tomatoes by hand, don’t worry about perfect peeling; skin cooks down and adds texture. Rough chop chunks, don’t overdo or sauce gets mushy later. Dry basil leaves just before use, toss near end to keep fresh punch; too early means dull, limp flavor."
- "Heat oil moderate heat, listen for gentle sizzle, not pop. Add sliced garlic thin but not paper-thin or it burns fast, scorched garlic poisons sauce. Onion diced fine melts into sweetness, soften fully but never brown. Timing key here, garlic gets bitter quick."
- "Simmer uncovered to let sauce thicken; don’t stir constantly or you kill bubbles. Scrape bottom with wooden spoon occasionally to avoid scorch but be gentle. After 30 mins sauce should shift texture, test taste for acidity; add splash vinegar or sugar to balance sharp bite."
- "If sauce too watery, simmer longer uncovered; thickens as it cools too, patience needed. Too thick? Thin with splash water or broth. Burnt flavor from garlic or tomato? Quickly add fresh chopped tomatoes or sugar to cut bitterness; works surprisingly well."
- "Use canned whole peeled tomatoes if fresh not available; drain excess liquid first or sauce ends too thin and watery. Basil best fresh; if not, substitute dried oregano or parsley but add after cooking as heat kills dried herb aroma. Chili flakes optional but add early with garlic for subtle heat buildup."
faq:
- "q: Can I use canned tomatoes instead of fresh? a: Yes, but drain liquid well first. Too much juice means watery sauce. Canned peeled in chunks closest to fresh texture. Adjust salt and simmer time accordingly."
- "q: Why do I get bitter garlic flavor? a: Garlic slices too thin or too hot oil makes bitterness. Watch oil heat, keep moderate. Remove from heat if browning shows. Let garlic soften but not brown."
- "q: My sauce stays thin, how to fix? a: Simmer uncovered longer. Patience here. Stir rarely, bubbles must break steady. Adding sugar helps thickness perception too. If rushed, use thicker tomato varieties or less liquid from canned."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in sterilized jars, keeps 4 days max. Freezes well but texture sensitive. Reheat slow, low temperature only; high heat breaks down flavor layers fast."
