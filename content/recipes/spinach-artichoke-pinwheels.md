description: "Flaky puff pastry swirls loaded with a creamy spinach and artichoke filling. Uses mayo, cheeses, and spices mixed right into chopped artichoke hearts and spinach. Rolled tight, chilled to firm up, sliced thick, baked till golden and puffy. Great appetizer, snack or party bite with that satisfying crunch and cheesy tang. Substitutions include Greek yogurt instead of mayo, or feta for sharpness swap. Timing flexible, watch dough color and filling set for perfect bake. Common slip: overstuffing makes cutting messy. Chill between rolling saves sanity and slicing ease. Garlic and onion powder give a quick punch, skip fresh for smoother melt-in-mouth filling."

ingredients:
- "1 can (14 oz) artichoke hearts chopped"
- "1 1/2 cups fresh spinach chopped"
- "1/3 cup mayonnaise substitute Greek yogurt for tang"
- "1 cup shredded mozzarella use provolone for twist"
- "1/4 cup grated Parmesan"
- "1 tsp onion powder"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "1/4 tsp white pepper"
- "1/4 tsp salt adjust to taste"
- "2 sheets puff pastry thawed"
- "1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil"
instructions:
- "Pulse artichokes coarsely if big chunks, no mush. Toss in spinach mayo cheeses all powders and seasoning. Give it a good mix so creamy coating no dry pockets. Set aside letting flavors mingle."
- "Roll out one puff pastry sheet on slightly floured surface. Brush olive oil evenly over whole surface, prevents sogginess and adds crisp note."
- "Spread half spinach mixture thick but leave about 1 inch clear margin all sides — important to seal and avoid leaks."
- "Roll tight from one long edge forming a log. Don’t rush or you’ll get air pockets in pastry."
- "Wrap log tightly in plastic wrap and pop in freezer. Chill about 25 minutes, firm but not frozen rock hard, slicing easier, less filling squish out."
- "Repeat prep, roll, chill with second sheet and filling half left."
- "Preheat oven 395°F — you want hot oven for puff. Fan or convection helps browning."
- "Remove chilled rolls, unwrap carefully. Using serrated knife, cut into roughly 1 inch thick slices. About a dozen per roll, thick enough so filling holds together when baking."
- "Place slices flat on baking sheet lined with parchment. Leave little space for expansion. They should resemble mini pinwheels now."
- "Bake 14-16 minutes watching closely. Look for golden puffed pastry with slightly toasted edges shifting color from pale to honey brown. Filling should bubble but not spurt out."
- "Remove and let rest 4-5 minutes before handling — prevents burn and filling settles firm."
- "Serve warm, best day of making. Leftovers reheat in toaster oven or air fryer to bring back crisp texture."
introduction: "I’ve made these pinwheels a bunch of times; first few attempts the filling oozed out during baking, pastry soggy in parts, and the roll just fell apart slicing it cold. Learned scattering a margin around filling is non-negotiable. Mayo does the creamy job but Greek yogurt switches it up, gives slight tang and cuts richness. Mozzarella keeps things melty, but swap for fontina or provolone for different nuance. Chill is key: freezes the roll enough to slice cleanly and not smash the dough, but don’t let it freeze solid or you chip the blade slicing. Baking hot and watching those golden edges is sweet satisfaction. The smell of bubbling cheese and toasted pastry hitting that right crisp, flaky crackle just before pulling out is worth the wait."
ingredientsNote: "Artichokes canned good, drain and roughly chop instead of processing smooth so texture holds. Fresh spinach provides that vegetal bite but don’t overdo or water lurks which wrecks puff. Mayo or Greek yogurt coats filling, excellent binder and fat to melt cheese into luscious mouthfeel. Cheese combo essential: mozzarella for melt, Parmesan for sharp salt finish. Onion and garlic powder over fresh here avoid wet filling spots and prevent sharp raw bits. EVOO brushed on dough seals, helps crust golden and crisp. Salt and white pepper balanced for delicate heat without overpowering. Puff pastry straight from freezer thaw one step ahead, cold but pliable; too warm equals sticky mess. Substitutions? Use cream cheese instead of mayo for richer filling and easier spreading. Parmesan can be swapped for Pecorino Romano if you want bolder flavor. If no fresh spinach, thawed frozen works but squeeze out excess water."
instructionsNote: "Mixing filling thoroughly ensures every bite coated evenly. Taking time to spread filling but leaving clear margins crucial or puff unravels when baking. Rolling tight prevents holes and air pockets that leak filling. Wrapping in plastic before chilling keeps shape firm, easier slicing. Cutting cold but pliable paste reduces squashing—you want clean, distinct spirals. Keep knife sharp and serrated preferred; dull knives tear dough. Baking at just under 400°F enough to puff pastry explode in flaky layers but no premature burning. Watch color not clock, golden edges, browned puff tops, bubbling cheese hints done. Rest before serving lets filling thicken slightly, no mouth burns, cleaner bites. Serving warm is best; leftovers reheat quickly to regain crisp texture. Avoid underbaking soggy fatty bites or overbaking dry hard twists. Keep eye on oven and slice thickness consistent for even cooking."
tips:
- "Chill rolls until firm but not frozen rock hard. Slicing cold dough clean cuts spirals without smooshing filling. Air pockets pop if rolled too loose. Always leaves 1 inch margin clear on edges keep filling locked snug inside. Use serrated knife sharp or blade drags dough, messes spiral shape."
- "Drain artichokes very well. Wet filling = soggy pastry troubles. Rough chop artichokes for texture, mush ruins bite. Fresh spinach chopped coarse but squeeze out water, frozen spinach legit if drained tightly. Dust your surface lightly so dough sticks less but no flour overload making dry crust."
- "Olive oil brush on puff surface seals top layer, blocks moisture seep, golden crisp crust follows. Don’t skip, essential step. Bake in preheated oven 395°F or slight convection for browning. Watch edges turning honey brown; not just timer. Filling bubbles but no spill means set filling, no messy drips."
- "If no mayo, Greek yogurt swaps clean tang, less fat but keeps creamy texture. For cheese, mozzarella blends melt, Parmesan sharpens salty notes. Provolone or fontina change flavor tempo. Too much filling causes messy slicing, cut thickness steady about 1 inch wide slices hold together in oven."
- "Cutting technique matters: serrated preferred, sharp blade. Dull knives tear dough and squish pinwheels. Rolling tight from long edge avoids air pockets that burst when baking. Plastic wrap before chilling locks shape. Let rested rolls warm slightly if slice too stiff snaps dough instead of cut."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid soggy pastry? a: Drain artichokes thoroughly. Spinach water squeezed tight. Brush dough with oil seals moisture. Chill rolls firm before slicing. Bake hot oven. Watch puff color not time alone. Soggy means too wet filling or underbake."
- "q: Substitutions ok? a: Mayo switch with Greek yogurt gives tang and less richness. Cheese tweak with provolone or fontina for different melt and flavor. Cream cheese richer spread, great binder. Fresh spinach better but frozen squeezed dry works. Adjust salt if swap cheeses."
- "q: Why does filling ooze out? a: Filling too wet or overfilling. Don’t fill edges fully, leave margin at least 1 inch bare to seal. Roll tight but not crushed. Chill save shape, slice cold. Sharp serrated knife stops squish/crush. Bake hot until pastry puffs and golden, filling bubbles set."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Cool completely. Refrigerate in sealed container up to 3 days. Reheat toaster oven or air fryer restores crisp in minutes. Don’t microwave or pastry soggy fast. Freeze logs pre-slice plastic wrapped well, thaw chilled before slicing and baking fresh."
