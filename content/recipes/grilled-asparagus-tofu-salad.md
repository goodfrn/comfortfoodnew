ingredients:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "75 ml olive oil"
- "50 ml finely chopped fresh chives"
- "50 ml flat-leaf parsley leaves minced"
- "40 g pitted sun-dried black olives, finely chopped"
- "40 g lightly toasted pumpkin seeds, roughly crushed"
- "25 ml grainy mustard"
- "12 ml agave syrup"
- "1 lemon, finely zested and juiced"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "500 g asparagus, trimmed"
- "15 small radishes"
- "1 medium red onion, quartered"
- "35 ml olive oil"
- "280 g shredded curly kale"
- "450 g silken tofu, room temperature, torn into chunks"
- "Fleur de sel, for finishing"
instructions:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "1. In a mixing bowl combine olive oil, chives, parsley, sun-dried olives, pumpkin seeds, mustard, agave, lemon zest and juice. Whisk aggressively until uniform. Season with salt and pepper. Put aside."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "2. Prepare the grill with a barbecue wok on one side; heat to medium-high. Oil the grill grate on the other side."
- "3. On a platter toss asparagus, radishes, and onion with olive oil, salt, and pepper until coated."
- "4. Place radishes and onion in the wok. Cook 10-12 minutes, stirring often, until charred edges appear and vegetables soften."
- "5. Simultaneously grill asparagus directly on grate, turning regularly for about 6-7 minutes until tender but still firm."
- "6. Remove radishes; halve them. Spread kale over serving plates. Arrange grilled asparagus, radish halves, and onion on top. Distribute torn tofu chunks over the salad. Sprinkle fleur de sel and freshly cracked black pepper generously over the tofu."
- "7. Drizzle a good amount of vinaigrette over salad. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Grilling changes everything. Asparagus gets smoky, radishes soften, onions caramelize a bit—altered textures, deepened flavors. Silken tofu torn, not sliced, adds smooth heft. Dressing thick with olives, herbs, mustard, and an unexpected swirl of agave. Lemon zests and pumpkins seeds crackle in the mouth. No gluten, no nuts, no eggs, no dairy. Just raw ingredients turned edible fireworks on the grill. Kale, curly and bitter, shoulders the mix. Chive and parsley bring vibrancy and freshness that don't quit. Quick turnaround, minimal fuss, bold enough for a main meal. Salad meals, reinvented. Crisp and soft. Sweet, sour, smoky, rich."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust olive oil quantities in vinaigrette to desired consistency—thicker if preferred, less oily if lighter. Pumpkin seeds can be swapped for toasted sunflower seeds to vary crunch and mild bitterness. Agave replaces honey for strict vegan compliance but brings mild sweetness without overpowering mustard’s grainy punch. Sun-dried olives bring umami depth; canned black olives lack the concentrated flavor depth but work in a pinch. Kale holds well under the warmth of grilled vegetables; substitute with romaine or baby spinach for a softer texture. Radishes—small, firm, crisp for grilling; larger may take longer or get bitter. Fresh lemon zest crucial for a zingy accent. Salt last to control seasoning precisely, enhances aroma."
instructionsNote: "Start with vinaigrette; get it mellowed while grilling preps. Heat barbecue wok first—tools matter here—to ensure char without burning. Toss vegetables evenly to maximize grill contact and caramelization. Keep asparagus separately grilled on grate for direct smoky flavor, and timing has to be tight—overcooked loses bite, undercooked too crunchy. Radishes and onions benefit from wok heat to trap their juices. Tear tofu gently to keep curd-like softness; avoid pressing or slicing as it breaks texture contrast. Assemble quickly as tofu cools fast and kale wilts under warmth. Fleur de sel sprinkled last for that flaky crunch, pepper freshly cracked directly before serving. Serve immediately; leftovers lose textural interplay."
tips:
- "Use fresh chives and parsley. Not dried. Key for bright flavors. Control the olive oil in the vinaigrette. It matters. Thicker dressing holds better. Adjust it for desired taste."
- "Grill asparagus directly over the heat. Timing critical. 6-7 minutes max. Keep turning it. A bit charred is good. Radishes can get soft fast on grill. Small ones work best."
- "Kale should be fresh. Rip or cut it smaller. It needs to hold up against hot grilled veggie. Otherwise, wilted mess isn't appetizing. Flavor combinations matter here."
- "Switch pumpkin seeds for other seeds if needed. Sunflower seeds offer similar crunch. Make vinaigrette first. This gets flavors working while grilling happens. Don't skip this."
- "Add more lemon zest if needed. Zing matters. Mustard balances nicely with agave. Adjust according to taste. Remember, fresh lemon juice brightens everything."
faq:
- "q: What if tofu falls apart? a: Try tearing gently. Don't press it too hard. This keeps texture. Slicing can ruin smooth bites. Extract moisture first too."
- "q: Best grill for veggies? a: Use a barbecue wok for even cooking. Avoid burning. Direct grill for asparagus is good. Radishes char nicely in wok. Both methods work."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Yes but not too long. Keep in fridge in airtight containers. Asparagus gets mushy. Tofu does not last well once warm. Consume quickly."
- "q: Any substitutes for ingredients? a: Yes plenty. Use romaine for kale. Swap olives for different ones if unavailable. Adjust other herbs as you like it too."
