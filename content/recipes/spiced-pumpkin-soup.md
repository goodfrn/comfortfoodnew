- "Roast 55 minutes. Flip, season with salt, pepper, smoked paprika. Roast another 25 minutes until soft. Drain any liquid."
- "While pumpkin roasts, heat 20 ml coconut oil in large pot on medium-high."
- "Add parsnips, celery, garlic, onion. Cook 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, no color wanted."

introduction: "Pumpkin roasting smells like fall but with a twist—like a whisper of smoke and fresh herbs. Parsnips replace carrots, richer and earthier. Coconut oil swaps butter. Bright basil and thyme mix fresh and fragrant, popping against mellow squash. Skipping chicken broth for vegetable broth keeps it vegan, light but hearty. A swirl of coconut cream gives velvety finish without dairy heaviness. That toasted pepita crunch? A must-have, more than garnish. Timing tweaks—roasting longer for tenderness, simmer extending to coax flavors out fully. Mixes old and new, somewhere between rustic and refined. Soup thick but not stodgy, bright not bland, simple but unboring."
ingredientsNote: "Choosing the right pumpkin matters—small, dense sugar pumpkins best, about 1.8 kg here, just under half the original weight. Seeds saved toasting later provide that crucial crunch. Coconut oil replaces butter—adds tropical warmth and dairy-free benefit. Parsnips take the carrot spot with a slightly sweeter, nuttier bite. Smoked paprika brings mild earthiness and a subtle smoky note, replacing plain seasoning and lifting the soup. Coconut cream makes it lush and dairy-free, thicker than regular cream, use sparingly if preferred lighter. Fresh thyme and basil, combined and chopped fine, make topping aromatic and green rather than dry flakes or only parsley. Pepitas toasted dry on skillet until golden boost texture and give a nutty hit while keeping it nut-free."
instructionsNote: "Roasting pumpkin face down locks in moisture but flip halfway for even cooking and seasoning adherence. Brushing outside with some coconut oil aids caramelization and prevents drying but adds subtle sweetness. The sauté step is crucial—do not brown the veggies, just soften to keep their brightness and build base flavor. Adding smoked paprika at roasting time lets it infuse into pumpkin flesh, deeper character. The simmer is longer on the veggies to coax out a richer broth. When blending, use caution—hot liquids expand, blend in batches or with small lid opening vented. Adjust thickness with broth if too thick after blending. Layer final garnishes last-minute so textures stay distinct—creamy swirl stays separate; pepitas stay crisp; herbs fresh, vibrant. Good for leftovers, flavors meld and deepen."
tips:
- "Roast pumpkin face down traps moisture but flip halfway. Brush outside with coconut oil for subtle caramelizing. Adds sweetness without extra sugar, keeps pumpkin tender. Season after flipping so paprika sticks well. Drain liquid after roasting to avoid soup dilution later."
- "Sauté veggies gently low to medium heat. No browning wanted. Play with timing here—soften but keep fresh flavors intact. Garlic and onion become mild, parsnips stay sweet. Stir infrequently but consistently enough to avoid sticking. Base flavor foundation."
- "When blending hot soup, caution needed. Hot liquids expand fast. Blend in small batches or with vented lid. Prevent splatter burns. Thickness can change after blending, add more broth gradually. Adjust seasoning only after blending; flavors come together then."
- "Toasted pepitas need dry skillet with constant stirring. Watch color closely; burn is quick. Crisp texture contrasts creamy soup base. Save seeds from pumpkin roasting for crunch later. Fresh herb mix chopped finely last minutes to preserve aroma and bright green color."
- "Combine fresh thyme and basil finely chopped. Gives herbal brightness offsetting smoky paprika and creamy coconut swirl. Keep herbs off heat until serving for max fragrance. Coconut cream swirl is thick, adds richness but light on dairy heaviness. Use sparingly if lighter finish wanted."
faq:
- "q: Can I use canned pumpkin? a: Possible but different moisture levels. Might need less broth. Texture variation. Roast if possible for flavor depth. Season carefully."
- "q: Substitute for coconut oil? a: Neutral oil like canola works. Butter adds dairy note. Coconut oil adds subtle sweetness. Use what fits diet. Flavor will shift a bit."
- "q: Why no browning in sauté step? a: Browning changes veggie flavor, can overpower delicate soup base. Softening vegetables keeps brightness, clearer flavor. Smoke paprika in roasting adds smoky note instead."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container 3-4 days. Freeze if longer, use within 2 months. Reheat gently on stove or microwave, stir often. Coconut cream may separate, stir back in. Pepitas best toasted fresh."
