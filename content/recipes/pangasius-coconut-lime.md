slug: "pangasius-coconut-lime"
description: "Chunks of pangasius poached gently in fragrant coconut milk infused with fresh ginger and ground coriander, brightened by lime zest and juice. Fish tender but firm, enveloped in creamy sauce with subtle spicy warmth from ginger and earthy tones of coriander. Served over jasmine rice with fresh greens and lime wedges. Adapted with turmeric replacing coriander, swapped ginger with lemongrass for sharper citrusy aroma. Perfect for those avoiding nuts, dairy, gluten, and eggs. Cooked just right so fish flakes without falling apart, sauce thickened slightly, aromas layered. Timing flexible relying on bubbles and softness rather than clock."

ingredients:
- "700 g pangasius fillets, cut into chunks"
- "400 ml canned coconut milk"
- "2 tbsp finely chopped lemongrass (white part only)"
- "1⁄2 tsp turmeric powder"
- "Zest and juice of 1 lime"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Put coconut milk into a deep saucepan over medium heat. Add chopped lemongrass and turmeric powder. Stir to combine. Heat until small bubbles kiss the edge of the pan, not rolling boil but audible simmer."
- "Nestle in pangasius chunks in one even layer, spooning some coconut milk over the top. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Cover with lid, lower heat to gentle simmer."
- "Keep an eye. When fish looks opaque and starts flaking easily with a fork, about 12 minutes, check sauce thickness. If too thin, uncover and simmer another 3 minutes to concentrate flavors."
- "Remove from heat, stir in lime zest and juice slowly, tasting as you go. The bright citrus cuts through creamy richness. Adjust seasoning; more salt or lime as needed."
- "Serve immediately atop steamed jasmine rice. Scatter fresh greens like bok choy or snap peas. Lime wedges on side to squeeze fresh zing."
- "Optional twist: squeeze a dash of fish sauce or a sprinkle of chili flakes to kick it up."
introduction: "Fish stewed in coconut milk, something simple but tricky to get right. Fish must stay tender, sauce creamy without splitting. Tried ginger but swapped it for lemongrass—cleaner, sharper. Turmeric instead of coriander grounds the flavor in earthiness without overwhelming. Lime zest and juice wake it all up. Used pangasius for delicate texture but you can use cod, tilapia, anything white and flaky. Jasmine rice is more than just a side; it mellows the dish. Greens add necessary snap and color. The trick is watching the fish cooked gently, bubbles forming around edges, not a roar of boil or mushy pieces. Cooking times are guides, your senses matter more. That sweet coconut aroma mingled with citrus, the sound of simmering, the feel of flaky fish—these tell you when it’s done. It’s a dance."
ingredientsNote: "Slight tweaks in quantities matter—700g pangasius is easier to manage than 675g precise. Coconut milk should be full fat for richness, avoid watered down cans. Lemongrass has sharper citrus than ginger, use fresh for best aroma; if dry, double the amount or substitute with fresh ginger if unavailable. Turmeric powder gives warm color and subtle earthiness, but fresh turmeric root works if finely minced. Lime zest is essential —don't skip or substitute with lemon, it changes profile. Salt gradually, as coconut milk masks seasoning at first. Black pepper grounds flavors. For dairy or nut intolerance, coconut milk is perfect; no need for cream or butter. If concerns on sustainability, substitute pangasius with tilapia or cod, but adjust cooking times slightly. Lemongrass tough parts should be discarded after cooking to prevent bitterness."
instructionsNote: "Start heating coconut milk first to bloom aromatics like lemongrass and turmeric —this releases essential oils and builds depth. Avoid a hard boil; you want gentle simmer that ruffles surface, tells you sauce is warming without curdling. Add fish and cover promptly to trap steam; it cooks fish evenly, holds moisture. Check fish doneness by gentling poking with fork, looks opaque but still moist, flakes easily. Overcooked fish flakes too much, becomes mealy. If sauce too thin at end, remove lid, medium heat for few mins thickens it through evaporation. Add lime juice last —heat can dull that fresh acidity. Taste before final seasoning; sometimes a pinch more salt or lime juice balances flavors. Don’t rush or stir too vigorously, fish chunks may fall apart. Serve immediately; sauce tends to thicken and set upon cooling. Leftovers reheat gently, adding splash of coconut milk to loosen sauce. For quicker prep, swap lemongrass with ground lemongrass powder but fresh is superior."
tips:
- "Heat coconut milk gently, watch for tiny bubbles just touching pan edge. Not a full boil, that splits sauce. Bloom lemongrass and turmeric early to unlock oils but keep flame low to preserve aroma."
- "Add fish chunks evenly spaced. Crowding traps steam but too tight risks sticking. Cover quickly to hold moisture and steam from thick coconut milk matrix cooks fish softly while frying edges slightly."
- "Test doneness by poking gently. Fish opaque but still moist inside, flakes easily under light pressure. Overcook and pieces crumble; no creaminess in sauce if fish falls apart. Timing flexible; use senses not clock strictly."
- "Lime zest and juice added last, off heat or very low. Heat dulls citric brightness, so mix slowly, taste repeatedly. Adjust salt gradually since coconut milk masks flavors early on, finishing seasoning key to balance."
- "If sauce seems too thin late, remove lid, simmer medium heat few mins to evaporate water. Watch carefully; too long thickens sauce beyond creamy silkiness. Better thinish than curdled or sticky. Reheat leftovers gently with splash coconut milk."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other fish? a: Absolutely, cod or tilapia work well. Texture differs though. Pangasius delicate so cook time may shorten. Watch bubbles and flakes carefully."
- "q: Lemongrass not fresh? a: Double dried amount or swap with fresh ginger. Aromatic profile changes; sharper, less clean citrus. Not exact but close enough for strong flavor presence."
- "q: Sauce broke or split? a: Happens if sauce boils hard or stir too vigorously. Next time low heat, gentle simmer only. Add fish quickly, no harsh stirring. If split, add splash coconut milk slowly, whisk gently."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool fast, store covered in fridge up to 2 days. Reheat low and slow, add coconut milk splash to loosen sauce. Microwave risks overcooking fish—prefer stove top gently warming."
