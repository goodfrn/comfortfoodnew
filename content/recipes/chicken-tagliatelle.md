description: "Chicken thighs browned with onions and garlic. Turmeric, ginger, cinnamon switched up slightly. Harissa for heat. Broth simmers with olives and a twist of preserved lemon peel. Courgette diced, tossed in near the end. Tagliatelle cooked al dente, mixed back in with sauce, lifted with pasta water. Parsley and mint scattered on top for freshness. Altered spice quantities and cooking times slightly. Replaced ginger with cardamom, harissa swapped for harissa-infused chili oil. Some steps rearranged for layered flavor build-up. Balance of salty, tangy, and spicy."

ingredients:
- "315 g chicken thighs boneless skinless cut into large chunks"
- "2 medium onions chopped"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "45 ml olive oil"
- "3 ml ground turmeric"
- "3 ml ground cardamom"
- "1 ml ground cinnamon"
- "15 ml harissa-infused chili oil"
- "900 ml low sodium chicken broth"
- "60 g mixed green and black olives pitted quartered"
- "20 ml diced preserved lemon peel"
- "1 medium zucchini diced small"
- "450 g dried tagliatelle"
- "30 g fresh flat-leaf parsley chopped"
- "20 ml fresh mint chopped"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add chicken pieces, onions, and garlic. Brown until chicken is no longer pink and onions soften, about 8 minutes."
- "Sprinkle turmeric, cardamom, and cinnamon over skillet contents. Stir quickly for 45 seconds. Drizzle harissa-infused chili oil, mix well."
- "Pour in chicken broth, add olives and preserved lemon. Bring to a simmer. Cook uncovered for 25 minutes until sauce is reduced roughly by half and thickened."
- "Toss in diced zucchini. Cook 3 minutes stirring often. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
- "Meanwhile, boil salted water. Cook tagliatelle just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes. Reserve 125 ml pasta water. Drain noodles."
- "Add drained pasta to sauce pan. Fold to coat strands evenly. Use reserved pasta water to loosen sauce as needed."
- "Sprinkle with parsley and mint before serving. Serve immediately in deep plates."
introduction: "Chicken thighs chunked up. Onions caramelize slow under garlic. Turmeric teams with cardamom. Cinnamon lurks in background. Harissa oil gives a gentle burn, smoky. Liquid hits the pan—chicken broth cuts richness, brings moisture. Olives pop salty, diced preserved lemon tangs sharp, bright. Zucchini folds in last, soft but still a bite. Pasta cooks parallel; timing key. Tagliatelle, thin ribbons grab sauce best. Heat nudged down slightly while simmering; patient reduction needed. Fresh herbs chopped wild, parsley and mint scatter final punch. Serve scoops steaming in deep bowls. Midweek magic. Not complicated. Flavor bold but balanced. No fuss, just layers."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken thighs chosen for tenderness and rich flavor. Boneless and skinless for easy quick cooking. Onions and garlic foundational aromatics. Olive oil base; use quality but not extra virgin to tolerate higher heat. Spices adjusted slightly—cardamom swaps for ginger to add warmth without sharpness. Cinnamon kept low to avoid overpowering. Harissa replaced by oil infusion for subtlety in heat. Chicken broth low sodium controls salt level better. Olives combination of green and black balances sharpness and mellow notes. Preserved lemon peel diced fine to scatter rather than overwhelm. Zucchini adds freshness and faint crunch contrast. Tagliatelle dry convenient, though fresh if available cooks quicker with less starch release. Herbs added last to retain brightness and texture. Salt and pepper customized per taste since broth and olives contribute saltiness."
instructionsNote: "Start with heating oil medium-high but control so chicken browns evenly, about 8 min, stir often to avoid burning garlic. Add spices quickly after browning for even toast but no bitterness, about 45 seconds maximum. Harissa oil introduced at this stage for aroma, then broth poured in immediately to deglaze and simmer. Once mixing broth with all ingredients, encourage simmer uncovered so liquid reduces and thickens for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Zucchini goes near end, only few minutes to keep tender. Salt is added late as broth, olives already salty. Pasta cooks al dente to maintain structure in sauce. Reserve pasta water for sauce thinning - better than broth dilution. Combining pasta off heat prevents overcooking. Final herb garnish sprinkled immediately before plating for freshness. Serve while hot, no resting needed."
tips:
- "Control heat well when browning chicken and onions. Medium-high is good. Too high burns garlic fast. Watch for even cooking. About 8 minutes. Stir often."
- "Use quality olive oil but not extra virgin. Higher smoke point needed. This dish benefits from a little richness. Spice adjustments are crucial. Cardamom adds warmth."
- "Reserve pasta water before draining tagliatelle. Much better than broth for thinning sauce. It helps coat noodles. Zucchini goes in last few minutes. Keeps some crunch."
- "Seasoning salt and pepper is late in the game. Broth and olives are salty already. Tastes tricky. Check while cooking. Adjust to your needs. Balance is key."
- "Final step, add herbs to plated pasta. Brightness hits dish. But do it just before serving. No time to rest. Eat while hot. Enjoy layers of flavor."
faq:
- "q: How to get chicken tender and flavorful? a: Choose thighs over breasts. More fat. Adds moisture. Brown well. Let spices infuse. Balance is crucial here."
- "q: What if I want different veggies? a: Try bell peppers, or spinach. Change up based on season. Just keep zucchini for crunch. But others will work too."
- "q: Can I use fresh tagliatelle? a: Yes, but be careful. Cooks faster, adjust timing down. Less starch, sauce clings nicely. Test for al dente."
- "q: Storage tips for leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight. Good for three days. Reheat gently to avoid mush. Add a bit of water for sauce."
