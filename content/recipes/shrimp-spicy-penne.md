title: "Shrimp Spicy Penne Twist"
slug: "shrimp-spicy-penne"
description: "Penne pasta cooked al dente tossed with spicy tomato sauce enriched by sautéed shrimp. Aromatic onion and crushed chili flakes begin the sauce. White wine reduces; canned crushed tomatoes simmer to thicken. Shrimp seared quickly, spiked with extra garlic and zesty lemon zest replacing parsley. Olive oil provides richness, finishing with a sprinkle of grated pecorino romano instead of parmigiano reggiano. Slightly less chili flakes to tame heat. Cooking times adjusted: sauce simmers a little longer; pasta slightly shorter. The twist is a splash of lemon juice brightening the savory, peppery base."

- "70 ml (about 1/3 cup) dry white wine"
- "1 can (800 ml or 28 oz) crushed Italian plum tomatoes"
- "=== Pasta and shrimp ==="

- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "1 tbsp lemon zest"
- "1 tbsp fresh lemon juice"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) chopped fresh basil leaves"
- "100 ml (about 1/2 cup) grated pecorino romano cheese"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Sauce assembly ==="
- "1. Heat olive oil in medium saucepan over medium heat. Sweat chopped onion and crushed chili flakes till softened and fragrant, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
- "2. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in white wine, increase heat and reduce by roughly half, around 8 minutes."
- "3. Add crushed tomatoes, stir, reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes. Taste and adjust salt, pepper, and chili flakes as desired. Stir occasionally."
- "=== Cooking pasta and shrimp ==="
- "4. Bring large pot salted water to boil. Drop in penne and cook about 10 minutes until just al dente. Drain piping hot, toss with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking. Set aside."
- "5. While pasta cooks, heat olive oil in large skillet over high flame. Add shrimp, season with salt and pepper, and sear quickly until pink and opaque, about 2-3 minutes per side depending on size."
- "6. Add lemon zest and lemon juice to shrimp. Give sauce a quick stir and pour it over shrimp, simmer briefly to combine and bring to gentle bubble, about 2 minutes."
- "7. Add drained pasta directly to the skillet with shrimp and sauce. Toss with fresh basil. Adjust seasoning if needed."
- "8. Serve immediately, sprinkled generously with grated pecorino romano."
introduction: "Shrimp, spice. Penne soaked in a tangy tomato mash. No cream, no fuss. Start with the fire of crushed chili flakes. Onions sweet under olive oil heat, garlic sharp and quick. Wine cuts sharp, reduces slow. Tomatoes bubble, thicken, swear they’re worth the wait. Pasta cooks, never soggy. Shrimp hot and fast, pink popping, kissed by lemon heat instead of dull parsley. Pecorino is sharper here, biting harder than parmigiano. You lose some heat but gain zing. Timing shifts, a little more patience on sauce, less on pasta — texture counts. It’s simple, yes, but it’s nearly electric."
ingredientsNote: "Shrimp chosen can be with or without tails but keep dry for searing. Parsley is swapped for basil and lemon zest—bring fresh herb fragrance and citrus brightness over leafy earthiness. Pecorino romano swaps parmigiano for salty sharpness, a small twist toward the unexpected but fitting. Chili flakes reduced; aim for heat balanced, not shock. Olive oil quantity bumped slightly to compensate for moisture in added lemon juice. Tomatoes remain the canned crushed type, for consistent texture and acidity. Wine quantity increased for deeper flavor and sauce reduction. Pasta quantity slightly up for fuller plate and better ratio to protein. Fresh lemon juice crucial — adds brightness and cut to offset richness and heat. Salt and pepper remain simply adjustable flavors. Cooking times shifted slightly to avoid overcooking shrimp and maintain pasta firmness."
instructionsNote: "Sweat onion slowly or risk bitter notes; patience here builds the sauce base. Chili flakes go in early to bloom their heat into the oil. Garlic adds last in the sauce stage to avoid burning, timing is crucial. Wine reduces over moderate heat; watch nondistracted, takes about 8 minutes, cut down too fast and you lose acidity punch. Tomatoes simmer longer—15 minutes—to thicken and deepen sauce intensity. Pasta cooks just shy of full done (about 10 minutes) for the perfect al dente bite. Tossed pasta with oil immediately after draining stops stick and clump. Shrimp sears on high flame quickly; do not overcrowd pan or they steam instead. Lemon zest and juice added post sear to let oils and citrus oils bloom with shrimp without overwhelming heat. Sauce joined with shrimp in pan to marry flavors gently and bring all to a brief simmer. Fresh basil stirred last to spare bright herb flavor from long heat. Cheese added as a finishing sprinkle at service time, not melted in sauce, for pronounced, salty texture. Step order rearranged so sauce can simmer ahead while pasta and shrimp prep proceeds. Timing offsets give room for multi-tasking without overcooking. Salt and pepper tune the dish at multiple checkpoints—onion, shrimp, final combine—to keep flavors balanced. Serve piping hot to keep cheese firm but melty when eaten."
tips:
- "Start on onion low heat, sweat slow. Avoid browning or bitterness. Chili flakes early, bloom in oil, heat deepens but keep watch to not burn. Garlic in last minute, sharp punch, no raw taste. Wine steady simmer, reduce slow, takes time — keep bubble steady. Tomato simmer longer, 15 min for thicker, richer sauce. Stir off and on, no lid to evaporate."
- "Pasta timing key — cook just shy al dente, about 10 minutes. Overcook and it mushes. Hot drain, toss with olive oil to stop sticking immediately. Set aside in warm. Shrimp sear hot and fast, don’t crowd pan or steam forms, loses crunch. Flip only once. Pink and opaque, no rancid smell, no extra liquid in pan. Lemon zest and juice added after sear, not before, to avoid bitterness, citrus oils fresh but not overpowering."
- "Combining pasta with shrimp and sauce in pan, toss quickly but gently. Basil added at end, fresh leaves torn or chopped, avoid cooking down or flavor loss. Pecorino romano grated at service only, not melted in sauce — keeps salty punch intact with contrasting texture. Salt and pepper added at multiple steps; taste and adjust often to keep balance. Keep heat gentle when combining, long simmer burns basil and lemon brightness."
- "Olive oil quantities matter — extra virgin to sweat onion and chili, regular olive oil for shrimp sear. Keeps flavors distinct. Dry shrimp important: pat dry thoroughly to avoid water splatter and better sear. Tails optional but remove if preferred for easier eating. Use canned crushed tomatoes for consistency and acidity; avoid fresh tomatoes for this flavor profile. White wine can be dry or medium dry, not sweet, to balance acidity and deepen sauce."
- "Simmer sauce uncovered with stirring helps thicken. Avoid high heat here or sauce tastes raw and thin. Pasta stirred and tossed right after drain. Shrimp timing crucial; overcook and texture toughens. Lemon juice splash at end cuts richness, wakes sauce, bright without sourness. Basil last minute keeps green, fresh. Pecorino romano sharper than Parmigiano; expect salty, assertive finish. Adjust chili flakes to taste but lower ratio balances heat with brightness."
faq:
- "q: How to keep shrimp tender? a: Sear hot and fast. Don’t overcrowd pan or steam. Flip once, pink opaque means done. Overcook and shrimp tough, rubbery texture. Dry shrimp before cooking helps, removes moisture that causes boiling instead of searing."
- "q: Can I use fresh tomatoes? a: Possible but changes texture, acidity. Canned crushed tomatoes preferred for thickness, consistent flavor. Fresh needs longer cooking, breaking down frustrating. If using fresh, remove skins, seed extra water, cook slowly to thicken sauce."
- "q: Pasta too sticky? a: Drain hot pasta promptly. Toss with some olive oil right away. Don’t rinse—loses starch which helps sauce cling. Stir often while simmering in sauce so pasta doesn’t clump. Cook pasta less than package time to keep firm and prevent mush."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store pasta and sauce separate if possible. Refrigerate in airtight container up to 2 days. Shrimp tougher reheated; gentle warming on low with splash water or wine works. Can freeze sauce without shrimp. Thaw slowly and combine fresh shrimp later for best texture."
