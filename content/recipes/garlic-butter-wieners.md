slug: "garlic-butter-wieners"
description: "Small cocktail wieners wrapped in triangles of crescent dough. Rolled from wide to narrow end. Brushed with garlicky melted butter, salt sprinkled on top. Bake until light golden with a slight crisp. Play with dough cutting for multiple smaller pieces. Timing flexible, watch dough’s color for doneness. Butter mix softens the dough's exterior while garlic aroma roasts in oven. Useful snack for parties or quick bites. Calories low per piece but watch sodium if counting. Simple twists include swapping wieners for mini sausages or adding shredded cheese inside before rolling."

ingredients:
- "1 can crescent rolls (8 triangles)"
- "24 cocktail wieners"
- "3 tablespoons butter, melted"
- "1 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 380F, gets hot fast, so don't wait"
- "Unroll crescent dough, slice each large triangle into 3 smaller ones, careful on dough thickness to avoid tearing"
- "Take one cocktail wiener, place at triangle’s wide base, start rolling tightly but not squishing ends, end at narrow tip"
- "Arrange these on baking sheet, leave at least 2 inches gap for expansion and crisp edges"
- "Mix warm melted butter with garlic powder, more butter means soggier dough; spoon carefully on each crescent, avoid pooling"
- "Lightly sprinkle salt over tops, gives crunch and tames buttery sweetness"
- "Place in oven. Watch dough carefully near 12 min mark, pull when dough turns light golden brown, edges firm but not burnt"
- "Remove, let cool briefly for better bite and avoid scalding"
- "Serve warm. Can add side dips like mustard or ranch, optional but worth"
introduction: "Crescent dough and cocktail wieners—a combo that’s been around, sure. But cutting the triangles thinner changed everything; more bites, better ratio of dough to meat. Butter mixed with garlic powder—skip fresh finely minced garlic here, it burns fast and makes the dough soggy. Simple tough love. I learned the hard way to roll from wide to narrow end so the dough stays snug, no giant puffs or gaps. The golden color when baking—that’s your sign, not some exact timer. Wait for that gentle crisp crack on edges and some bounce if poked. Salt’s essential here; without it, the butter feels flat. Maybe sub smoked sausage for the wieners if you want some kick. Or toss in some shredded cheddar before rolling but watch for leaks. Clean kitchen hacks—line baking sheet with parchment. Trust the senses, not the clock."
ingredientsNote: "Crescent dough from any brand works but avoid extra buttery or filled packs; they muddle texture. Cocktail wieners can be swapped for mini smoked sausages or even small chunks of kielbasa cut to length, just check size fits well. Butter quantity fine-tuned by texture: too much and dough is mushy, too little the garlic doesn’t stand out. Garlic powder essential—fresh garlic will burn quickly and make dough heavy. Salt for topping should be coarse like kosher to add crunch and balance sweetness. If out of kosher salt, flaky sea salt works but measure carefully to avoid overpowering. For subtler garlic, consider garlic salt but reduce added salt accordingly. A little black pepper or smoked paprika mixed in the butter is a nice twist for smoky notes."
instructionsNote: "The oven heat and dough proportion matter most. Preheat thoroughly or dough won’t brown evenly, leading to gummy centers. Cutting triangles smaller multiplies the total pieces, great for sharing but watch baking time slightly longer due to size differences. Rolling direction is practical: start from thick base ensures the dough envelopes the wiener well; rolling from narrow end risks hotspots where dough may separate. Space crescent rolls well on sheet—crowding steams dough and makes texture dull. Butter-garlic mix applied as a spoon drizzle, not soaked brush, limits soggy bottoms. Salt on top encourages a textural contrast and boosts flavor punch. Use the timing as rough guide; the best signal is a subtle crunch at edges and slight pulling away from pan. Let rest for 5 minutes after baking to firm up interior before serving. Dips optional—these can stand alone but mustard-based combos elevate the taste."
tips:
- "Preheating oven fully critical. Underheated means dough soggy, no crisp edge. I once skipped this; dough baked pale and chewy. Watch dough color, slight golden tint not burnt. Pull when edges start cracking softly. Timing varies with smaller triangles; more but longer bake needed."
- "Cut crescent dough thinner than standard, triples pieces but watch baking time. Thin dough rolls snug, no gaps or giant air bubbles, keeps moist interior and crisp outside. Rolling from wide end traps wiener well, tried narrow end rolls separate, messier bake."
- "Butter quantity matters—too much makes dough wet and gummy. Mix garlic powder in melted butter, spoon drizzle, not soaked brush; prevents pooling. Fresh garlic burns fast, ruins texture, stays bitter. Salt on top needed, coarse kosher or flaky sea salt adds crunch, beats fine table salt."
- "Space wieners at least 2 inches apart on baking sheet or steam forms, dough turns soft not crisp. I used parchment repeatedly to avoid sticking and easier cleanup. Let baked pieces rest 5 minutes; interior firms, flavor settles, easier to eat without burning mouth."
- "Alternative filling ideas: mini smoked sausages swap well for wieners, add shredded cheddar before rolling but fold edges tight to stop leaks. Black pepper or smoked paprika in butter adds smoky notes if you want twist. Dips optional but mustard-based work well for balance."
faq:
- "q: Why roll dough from wide end? a: Wide end covers wiener snug. Narrow end rolls slip or open gaps. Tried both ways. Wide end keeps tight seal. Bakers recommend this. Keeps moisture in, avoids uneven bake."
- "q: Can I use fresh garlic? a: No, burns fast. Burnt garlic bitter, dough soggy. Powder disperses flavor evenly. If fresh must roast lightly first or add after baking, but messy. Powder best control for texture."
- "q: How to avoid soggy dough? a: Oven temp primary. Underheated traps moisture, no crust. Also limit butter quantity; too much pools under dough. Space pieces, air circulation cures sogginess. Parchment helps avoid sticking but doesn't solve soggy."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap airtight, fridge few days. Reheat in oven or toaster oven to bring back crisp. Microwave ruins texture mostly soggy. Freeze individually if needed; thaw then re-crisp carefully in oven."
