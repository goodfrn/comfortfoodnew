introduction: "Pork chops grilled. Charred zucchini wedges tossed with herb-packed vinaigrette. Punchy and aromatic. A simple combo—not fussy. Meat gets a quick sear over medium-high heat. Rest time essential—the juices settle, no dryness. Zucchini's roasted fast in the same pan, picking up those grill marks. Herbs swapped: basil jumps in for mint, pumpkin seeds with a solid crunch instead of sunflower. Dressing brightened by lemon and tamari replacing traditional fish sauce. Agave lends subtle sweetness, paired with sharp ginger kick. One bowl for vinaigrette, another for veggies, then all mixed. Easy prepping, quick cooking. Serves 4 to 6 depending on appetite. Grain-, dairy-, and egg-free. Great midweek meal with a touch of fancy."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil is a stable base; enough fat for grilling and dressing. Lemons bring acidity, fresh and natural. Tamari swaps fish sauce—keeps umami but suits those avoiding seafood. Agave stands in for maple syrup for a neutral sweetness that's gentle but present. Garlic joins freshly grated ginger for warmth and slight heat. For the pork, bone-in or boneless works—but thickness around 2.5 cm ensures even cooking. Zucchini cut sizeable to keep texture through grilling. Toasted pumpkin seeds bring crunch, replacing the original sunflower seeds for a nuttier flavor profile. Dill remains as a classic fresh herb, but basil steps in for mint, giving a different aromatic punch without overpowering. All ingredients easy to grab from most kitchens and lend themselves to flexible substitutions if needed."
instructionsNote: "Whisk vinaigrette ingredients early to layer flavors. Garlic and ginger finely grated ensure smooth blending with oil and lemon. Season pork chops before heating pan, avoid crowding. Medium-high heat forms a crisp sear; cooking each side 5-6 minutes locks in juices. Tent under foil to rest—the pause crucial. Toss zucchini chunks with oil and seasoning separately. Use the same pan to capture residual pork flavor in zucchini char. 3-4 minute sides crisp but don't overcook. Return zucchini to vinaigrette bowl immediately so warmth melds flavors. Stir in toasted pumpkin seeds and fresh herbs last; prevents wilting and preserves bite. Slice pork across the grain to maximize tenderness when plating. Final drizzle of extra vinaigrette uplifts the dish before serving."
tips:
- "For the vinaigrette, mix oil, lemon juice, tamari in a bowl early on. Ginger and garlic fine grated. It helps in blending flavors well. Let it sit. Reserves flavor."
- "Pork chops should be seasoned with salt and pepper before hitting the grill. Medium-high heat is key. Each side needs to sear for 5 to 6 minutes. Don't crowd pan."
- "Use the same pan for zucchini. It picks up flavor. Toss in olive oil and season. Char sides for about 3 to 4 minutes. Quick but effective, avoid mushy."
- "Zucchini chunks can be cut larger for texture. They should hold up during cooking. It gives a nice contrast to the soft pork. Balances dish nicely at the end."
- "Make sure to let pork rest covered in foil. This settles juices, keeps meat moist. Slice thin against the grain when ready. Looking for tenderness."
faq:
- "q: What's best way to grill pork chops? a: Cook on medium-high heat for 5 to 6 minutes each side. Rest before slicing for best results. Juicy meat is the goal."
- "q: How to know if zucchini is done? a: Look for slight char on the outside. Tender but firm is good. Don't overdo it; no one wants mushy veggies."
- "q: Can I use different nuts? a: Sure! Pumpkin seeds add crunch. Pine nuts work well too. Swap easily depending on preference. Adjust flavor accordingly."
- "q: How to store leftover salad? a: Keep separate for best quality. Zucchini can get soggy fast. Fridge works but eat within 2 days for freshness."
