ingredients:
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "35 g finely chopped roasted unsalted peanuts"
- "1 small garlic clove finely grated"
- "50 ml reduced sodium soy sauce"
- "15 ml vegetable oil"
- "12 ml sugar"
- "10 ml rice vinegar"
- "1.25 ml red chili flakes"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "80 g rice vermicelli"
- "150 g curly leaf lettuce torn"
- "5 Lebanese cucumbers halved lengthwise then cut in angled chunks"
- "1 firm ripe avocado thinly sliced"
- "1 block 400 g silken tofu drained and torn"
- "2 stalks green onion sliced"
instructions:
- "=== Salad ==="
- "1. Heat water to boil and salt lightly. Soak vermicelli off heat for 5 minutes until tender. Drain. Rinse under cold water, drain well. Cut noodles into thirds."
- "2. Divide vermicelli, lettuce, cucumbers, and avocado on plates. Scatter torn tofu over all."
- "=== Dressing ==="
- "3. Mix peanuts, garlic, soy sauce, oil, sugar, vinegar, and chili flakes in a bowl. Season with pepper."
- "4. Drizzle dressing over salad bowls. Sprinkle green onions on top. Serve with chili crisp on side if you want extra heat."
- "5. Eat immediately or chill briefly for contrast. Textures shift with cold silky tofu and crunchy cucumber."
introduction: "Silken tofu torn into pieces, matching the soft noodles and fresh veg. Crunch from chopped roasted peanuts folded into a garlicky soy dressing. Crisp Lebanese cucumber chopped sharp. Avocado slices bring cream with delicate firmness—not mushy. Vermicelli soaked just enough to soften, then chilled. A bowl with pops of heat from chili flakes, sweet vinegar bite, and creamy tofu cool. No baking, frying, or long cooking. Vegan, nut-free besides peanuts, lactose-free, egg-free. Edgy, textural, quick to assemble. Ready in under half an hour. A fresh bowl, layered with flavor and contrast, every bite different. Optional chili crisp for those who want to kick it up."
ingredientsNote: "Roasted unsalted peanuts add crunch and richness in the dressing. Use reduced sodium soy to keep the salty note balanced. Garlic grated fine so it surrenders flavor evenly. Oil is neutral vegetable, a lighter touch than sesame oil but feel free to swap for depth. Sugar and vinegar balance acidity and sweet. Lebanese cucumbers work great for crunch and mildness. Silken tofu soft but firm enough to tear and hold shape, draining it helps. Avocados should be firm but ripe to slice thin without breaking. Green onions for freshness and slight pungency. Vermicelli rice noodles soak quickly—don’t boil fully to avoid mushy. This salad suits cold or room temp eating. Chili crisp is optional but adds pop of heat and texture not from peanuts."
instructionsNote: "Start by soaking vermicelli off boiling heat to avoid overcooking and losing texture. Cold rinse stops cooking immediately. Cut noodles small for balanced bites. Assemble greens first to help marinade absorb dressing and keep moisture away from tofu. Tofu best torn, not sliced, breakup reveals soft interior and holds dressing better. Mix dressing ingredients in a bowl, adjust sugar and vinegar to taste. Pepper to finish. Combine salad, pour dressing at last minute to prevent sogginess. Sprinkle green onion thin and last to preserve crispness. Serve with chili crisp alongside so diners can add heat gradually. The salad can rest 10 minutes cold to meld flavors but best just after assembling. If doubling recipe, dress just before serving for freshness."
tips:
- "Vermicelli soaked off heat for five minutes. Avoid overcooking. Rinse under cold water. This ensures texture stays intact. Cut noodles. Right size for bites."
- "Use firm ripe avocados. Thin slices add creaminess. Don’t let them get mushy. Choose Lebanese cucumbers for crunch. Not too strong in flavor. They hold well in salad."
- "Dressing mixing is key. Make sure peanuts chopped fine. Blend well. Let flavors mingle. Adjust the sugar and vinegar. Always taste. Garlic needs to spread through."
- "Serve right after assembling. Don’t let it sit too long. Dressing can make everything soggy. Keeping ingredients dry is essential. Add chili crisp as desired. Optional spice control."
- "For mixing, don’t be gentle. Toss it all to coat. This makes every bite tasty. Green onions sprinkle last. Keep them fresh. Just before serving on top."
faq:
- "q: Best way to ensure noodle texture? a: Soak vermicelli in hot water. Off heat for five minutes. Rinse cold. Cut for better bites. Easy approach works."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep salad separate from dressing. Up to two days in fridge. Noodles can turn mushy if mixed. Pack in airtight. Makes it last."
- "q: What if I can't find Lebanese cucumbers? a: Use regular cucumbers. They might be watery. Seedless is best for crunch. Slice thick for bite size."
- "q: Can I use different nuts? a: Stick to peanuts in dressing. Alternatives might change flavor. Other nuts can be toppings. But keep it nut-free for base."
