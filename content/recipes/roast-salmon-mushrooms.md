slug: "roast-salmon-mushrooms"
description: "Salmon filets seared and topped with a rich medley of wild mushrooms simmered in a tangy orange-infused sauce. Mixed pleurotes, shiitakes, and button mushrooms roasted in butter. Diced sun-dried tomatoes add a slightly sweet, punchy note. Cornstarch thickens the broth to a glossy finish. Zest of fresh orange scattered on top gives a bright, citrus sharpness. Cook times adjusted. Two mushrooms swapped out for oyster and cremini. Pine nuts swapped for toasted almonds to give a crunch. A sprinkle of fresh thyme added for herbal aroma. Serve over herb-infused wild rice, optional but fits well."

- "40 ml unsalted butter"
- "50 ml chopped sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil"
- "400 ml chicken broth"
- "12 ml cornstarch"
- "20 ml cold water"
- "700 g skinless salmon fillets cut into 4 pieces"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "Zest of one orange"
- "Fresh thyme leaves"
- "Salt and pepper"
- "100 g wild rice cooked"
- "30 g toasted almonds chopped"
instructions:
- "Heat butter in large skillet over medium-high. Toss mushrooms and sauté until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add sun-dried tomatoes, stir, cook one more minute."
- "Pour in chicken broth. Bring to boil then reduce heat to simmer for 5 minutes to concentrate flavors."
- "Mix cornstarch with cold water in small bowl until smooth. Stir into mushroom mixture. Simmer and thicken for roughly 2 minutes, stirring constantly."
- "Meanwhile, heat olive oil in another pan over medium-high. Sear salmon fillets approx 5 minutes per side until crust forms and center just opaque. Salt and pepper well."
- "Sprinkle orange zest and fresh thyme over salmon while still warm."
- "Serve salmon atop wild rice sprinkled with toasted almonds. Spoon mushroom orange sauce over everything."
- "Optional: Garnish with extra orange zest or thyme sprigs for color."
introduction: "Salmon seared hard to lock juices. Mushrooms pan-fried till brown. Oyster and cremini swapped in for earthier bite. Sun-dried tomatoes diced fine, add a sharp hit to mellow sauce. Orange zest not just twist—flavor boost and aroma punch. Cornstarch thicken mix just right, no lumps. Thyme added late for fresh snap. Wild rice under, nutty crunch with chopped almonds, textural contrast. Nothing shy here, bold flavors clash and mesh. Timing shifted slightly, cooks can watch closely. Little bigger pans help, mushrooms need room, no crowding. Fish skinless to sear cleanly. A simple plate turned complex but quick."
ingredientsNote: "Mushrooms: oyster and cremini complement shiitake for texture and flavor layers. Butter vital for browning, adds richness without overpowering. Sun-dried tomatoes pick up oils to release depth—drain well before chopping. Chicken broth base, keep unsalted if possible to control seasoning. Cornstarch mix added cold prevents clumping. Orange zest should be fresh, no white pith or bitter. Fresh thyme leaves optional but lift. Wild rice is sturdy, nutty, absorbs sauce. Toasted almonds take place of pine nuts for crunch, can swap for walnuts or pecans. Olive oil for fish pan, heat stable, good sear. Salt and pepper staples. Quantities reduced around 30%, keep balance but easier to handle for four portions."
instructionsNote: "Start mushroom sauté hot pan, use butter for flavor and browning. Stir occasionally but avoid overcrowding. Add sun-dried tomatoes after mushrooms are brown so oils release into pan. Simmer broth to reduce liquids, concentrate umami. Cornstarch slurry mixed cold keeps sauce smooth—pour slowly, stir constantly to avoid lumps. Keep sauce simmering during thickening, quick process. In separate pan, salmon seared on med-high, plenty of oil to crisp outside while keeping interior juicy. Four to five minutes per side depending on thickness. Season as you cook. Citrus zest and thyme right after cooking keeps freshness intact. Serve hot over rice with nut garnish to bring mouthfeel contrast. Final plating quick before sauce cools and sets. Timing adjusted by ±5 minutes total for ideal mushroom tenderness and fish doneness."
tips:
- "Use high heat for mushrooms. Start hot. Gets that browning. Butter helps here for flavor too. Avoid crowding the pan. Better browning that way. Mushrooms need space to release moisture. Stir occasionally but not constantly."
- "Searing salmon is crucial for texture. Skinless works best for clean sear. Each side 4-5 minutes, adjust for thickness. Don’t flip too soon. Wait for crust. Season well during cooking. Salt pepper good but timing matters."
- "Cornstarch slurry must be cold when mixing. Avoid lumps. Stir slowly but constantly when added to broth. Add during simmering. Keep it moving. 2 minutes thickens just right. Sauce should coat mushrooms without being gluey."
- "Orange zest shreds bring citrus punch. Right after searing salmon, sprinkle fresh. Gives aroma boost and color. Thyme leaves added later. Fresh herbs brighten flavor. Sprinkle over salmon for best impact. Don't skip this step."
- "Wild rice should be cooked ahead. Nutty flavor matches. Sturdy against sauce. Holds shape well. Almonds added for crunch. Toast them for extra flavor. If no almonds, walnuts or pecans work too. Balance is key in textures."
faq:
- "q: What is best way to prepare mushrooms? a: Clean well but avoid soaking. Use damp cloth for dirt. Slice and cook in hot pan. This gives that nice golden color. No watery mushy results."
- "q: Can I substitute chicken broth? a: Yes, vegetable broth works fine. Flavor change but still good. Broth adds depth to the dish. For richness, use homemade if available."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool down before refrigerating. Best kept in airtight containers. Will last 2-3 days. Reheat gently on stove for best texture. Avoid microwave if possible."
- "q: Can I add other ingredients? a: Yes, try adding spinach or kale. Adds more vitamins. Mix in during last few minutes of cooking sauce. Or switch tomatoes for fresh ones."
