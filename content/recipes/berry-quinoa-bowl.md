ingredients:
- "90 ml  (3/8 cup) plain Greek yogurt"
- "35 g  (1/4 cup) frozen blueberries (adjust per note)"
- "30 g  (1/4 cup) fresh blackberries"
- "½ small banana, thinly sliced"
- "10 ml  (2 tsp) pure maple syrup"
- "30 g  (1/4 cup) quinoa granola"

- "15 ml  (1 tbsp) hemp seeds (replacement for nuts)"
instructions:
- "1. In a personal blender with blending blade, combine Greek yogurt, frozen blueberries, and sliced banana. Add maple syrup. Blend until mostly smooth with some texture remaining, about 12 minutes total including pauses."
- "2. Transfer puree to a shallow bowl. Gently fold in fresh blackberries to keep them intact; don't blend these."

- "4. Rest 3-5 minutes if desired for oats to soak slightly."
- "5. Serve immediately or keep chilled for up to 1 hour before eating."
introduction: "Start morning rough shapes of fruit and culture meet plate. Cool, creamy thick Greek yogurt base shifted to 90 ml, less but still solid body. Blueberries' punch from frozen state reduced for subtle chill and fresh feel. Blackberries stay fresh, whole, contrast textures. Maple syrup down from 15 to 10 ml, just a whisper sweet. Half banana hangs sliced thinner, easy bite, quick flavor. Quinoa granola shrinks, complemented by a spoonful rolled oats and hemp seeds. Crunch, chew, different layers and bites, more than just sweet and cold. The process heads to blender first, then topping. Timing tweaked, 12 minutes blend with patience, half-frozen chunks soften, but not all gone. Then assembly, layering fruits and crunch. All happens between 15 and 20 minutes. A straightforward start to day, minimal fuss yet some thought."
ingredientsNote: "Greek yogurt packed with protein but less in quantity, good for smoother blend and lighter bowl. Frozen blueberries still icy, fresher taste but easier on blender if reduced to 35 g. Fresh blackberries kept whole, textures contrast. Banana sliced thinner makes distribution easier. Maple syrup reduced by about a third for tone-down sweetness, natural flavor. Quinoa granola reduced and mixed with rolled oats for more texture variety but still gluten-free, nut-free, egg-free safe. Hemp seeds here switch the crunch and protein game, replacing nuts, fitting allergies. Frozen fruit suggested to adjust depending on season or fresh availability. Oats provide soft chew contrasting granola crunch; soak slightly if waiting after assembly."
instructionsNote: "Blend mostly fruit and yogurt with syrup together first. Use personal blender blade; timing stretched to about 12 minutes total including pauses to avoid overheating, ensure small chunks soften but not dissolve completely. Do not blend all fruit - fresh blackberries fold in after blending preserves texture contrast. Transfer to wide bowl helps when eating to mix berries and granola. Sprinkling oats and hemp seeds adds multi-dimensional crunch distinct from quinoa granola’s nut-free cluster. Let sit briefly if preferred for softer oats but serve fresh for crunchier bite. No cooking needed, pure prep. Serve cold or at fridge temp up to one hour max, prevents sogginess but improves flavor melding. Simple, layered steps, chopping thinly is key for even bites."
tips:
- "Choose plain Greek yogurt. Packed with protein. Thick texture blends well. Less is more here. 90 ml is enough for smoothness. Adds creaminess but doesn’t overwhelm. Mandates balance with berries. Use frozen blueberries. They add chill, subtle sweetness too. Adjust 35 g better for blending. Makes it easier in personal blender. Fresh blackberries stay whole. This contrast is vital in texture."
- "Slice the banana thinly. Easier to distribute. Helps mix flavors well. Makes the bowl more inviting. A full half banana sliced into thin pieces. Perfect for this recipe. Maple syrup cut down. Moderation counts. 10 ml is a whisper, not overpowering. Brings natural flavor without too much sweetness. Blend carefully. About 12 minutes blending, short pauses crucial."
- "Consider the toppings. Qinoa granola offers crunch. But rolling oats add chewiness. Mix 30 g quinoa granola with 15 ml rolled oats. More texture variety. Hemp seeds are key here. Swap for nuts to avoid allergens. 15 ml offers extra protein. Topping changes with seasons. Use fresh fruit as available. Adjust blueberry amount if necessary."
- "Let the bowl rest a bit. 3-5 minutes, oats soak slightly. Softening a touch before serving. Yet serve chilled for best flavor. Timing matters. Textures, bites vary. Fresh fruit is essential. Don't blend all ingredients. Fold blackberries in right at the end. Preserve their form, keep their fresh punch. Assembly important, helps flavors combine."
- "Serving size is individual. 1 bowl is enough. Nutrition balanced and filling, 280 calories. Perfect for busy mornings. No cooking needed. Easy prep with personal blender. Serve immediately or keep up to an hour. Chilling keeps flavors intact. But avoid sogginess in granola. Simple layering distributes goodness evenly."
faq:
- "q: How to adjust for fruits in season? a: Use fresh berries as available. Frozen blueberries are great but fresh ones work too. Adjust amounts as preferred. Seasonal fruits like strawberries can replace. Creativity in fruits is key."
- "q: What if granola isn’t available? a: Replace with oats or seeds. Rolled oats can add chewiness like granola. Use extra hemp seeds for crunch. Plus, keep it nut-free. Mixing grains helps variety."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in the fridge, not too long. Maximum one hour. Flavors meld, but sogginess might happen. If waiting is longer, consider not adding granola until ready. Keep toppings separate."
- "q: Can this be meal prepped? a: Yes, but be cautious. Prepare the yogurt base beforehand. Mix berries in after blending is done. Add granola right before serving. Ensures crunch stays intact."
