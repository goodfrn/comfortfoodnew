description: "Chunky cocoa dough loaded with chocolate bits and walnuts. Gooey marshmallow core trapped inside. Topped with melty mini marshmallows, broken candy pieces, and more nuts. A combo of melted and chopped chocolate in the mix. Crisp edges but soft, sticky centers. Freezing dough balls before baking locks in texture and flavor. Real cocoa powder used for that deep, slightly bitter chocolate punch. Baking just right keeps marshmallows oozy but not burnt. Walnut crunch, chewy marsh plus candy shards provide a chaotic, tasty bite each time."

ingredients:
- "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1/4 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 cup milk chocolate chunks"
- "7 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "3 ounces bittersweet baking chocolate, chopped"
- "2/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/3 cup brown sugar, packed"
- "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
- "2 large eggs"
- "3/4 cup chopped walnuts plus 2 tablespoons extra"
- "1 1/2 tablespoon cookie scoop"
- "24 halved large marshmallows"
- "5 mini marshmallows per cookie (about 120 total)"
- "1 candy bar (milk chocolate, chopped into pieces)"
instructions:
- "Whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Toss in chocolate chunks and combine evenly. Set aside."
- "Melt butter and chopped bittersweet chocolate over low heat in a saucepan, stirring frequently until smooth. Let cool to just warm, not hot—keeps eggs happy later."
- "In a mixer on medium-high speed, blend granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, and cooled chocolate-butter mix about one minute. Should feel creamy and thick."
- "Drop speed to low; add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Avoid rushing here to keep batter silky."
- "Add dry ingredient mix in increments at medium speed. Stir just till combined; overmixing will toughen cookies."
- "Fold 3/4 cup chopped walnuts gently, no mixer now."
- "Prep two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats."
- "Use cookie scoop. Hold 2 scoops of dough, roll into balls, flatten slightly. Place a halved large marshmallow on bottom ball."
- "Cover with second flattened scoop, seal edges well, roll gently to encase marshmallow fully. Cracks mean leaks during bake."
- "Space balls 2 to 2 1/2 inches apart on trays. Freeze for 30 minutes—a must to keep marsh inside during baking."
- "Oven to 375°F. Bake 11 to 13 minutes. Edges set, centers slightly puffed, smell chocolaty but not burnt."
- "Pull out hot trays. Quickly press 5 mini marshmallows atop each cookie, scatter 4 chopped candy bar bits around marshmallows, then sprinkle extra walnuts."
- "Let rest 5 minutes on sheet. Marshmallow oozes, topping melts; cookies sticky but hold shape."
- "Transfer to wire rack to cool fully before digging in to prevent mess."
introduction: "Chocolate cookies stuffed with gooey halved marshmallow centers. Bittersweet baking chocolate melted into butter gives rich, deep chocolate notes. Milk chocolate chunks dispersed through dough add bursts of creaminess. Walnuts for crunch and slightly bitter finish. Topped with mini marshmallows and chopped candy bars for sticky, sweet, crunchy contrast. Freeze dough balls first—no marshmallow escape during baking and neater edges. Baking till edges are set but center still soft, pulls out fudgy results. Tried skipping freezing, messy splotches everywhere. Perfect oven temperature key; too hot melts marshmallows into oven floor. Approach with patience. Sounds of crackling marshmallows, smell of toasted nuts and chocolate fills air. A texture party: chewy, melty, chunky."
ingredientsNote: "Flour for structure, unsweetened cocoa powder for bittersweet depth—don’t swap with chocolate powder or results are bland. Baking soda for lift. Salt cuts sweetness, crucial. Milk chocolate chunks for pockets of creamy sweetness; can swap for dark if preferred but less sweet. Butter and baking chocolate melted together allows glossy, intense chocolate flavor and tender crumb. Granulated plus brown sugar balances chewiness and moisture. Vanilla crucial for aroma. Eggs bind and tenderize; adding slowly prevents lumps. Walnuts crunchy contrast; toasted before chopping adds flavor punch. Marshmallows, both large halved and mini, key for gooey surprise. Candy bars add texture and extra chocolate sweetness. Parchment or silicone mats prevent sticking and ensure even baking."
instructionsNote: "Start by whisking dry ingredients so chocolate chunks get evenly coated—helps chunk distribution. Melt chocolate and butter low and slow to avoid burning. Let cool until just warm; hot mix cooks eggs prematurely. Cream sugars with chocolate mixture until thickened—watch mixture change from shiny to satin texture. Add eggs on low speed; prevents over-aerating. Incorporate dry ingredients with care—the dough must stay fudgy, not stiff (overmix and dry, dense cookies). Folding nuts in by hand preserves chunkiness. Two scoops pressed together trap marshmallow inside; sealing edges tightly is critical—any gaps let marsh melt out. Freeze dough balls to firm up dough, preventing spreading and marsh squishing while baking. Bake till edges smell toasty, are just firm and crackly. Remove and swiftly dress tops with mini marshmallows, candy, and walnuts. Let rest on tray so toppings set but still sticky. Moving too soon causes breakage. Cool fully on rack to firm up entire cookie. Trying to skip freezing or rushing baking = mess and flat shapes. Patience wins here."
tips:
- "Whisk dry mix thoroughly first. Chocolate chunks must get coated evenly or clump and sink in uneven spots when baking. Avoid lumps that toughen edges or muddy pockets of cocoa flavor."
- "Melt butter and bittersweet chocolate over low heat slow slow slow. Don’t rush or mix will scorch. Let cool to warm not hot before blending sugars and eggs or batter breaks. Temperature key for smooth mix with great binding."
- "Add eggs slow on low mixer speed. Fast eggs add air bubbles that ruin chewy texture. Batter should feel thick, not fluffy. Timing here messes with cookie lift and chew."
- "Fold walnuts by hand last. Too much mixer action breaks nut pieces and makes dough dense. Hand folding maintains crunch and chunk texture balance. Toast walnuts before chopping for extra punch, skip if nut allergy or swap pecans."
- "Two scoops mash marhsmallows inside then seal edges tight. Cracks leak marshmallow, burning and mess. Seal with gentle pinch, roll to smooth surface, freeze dough balls minimum 30 mins tills firm. No freeze equals marsh ooze everywhere."
- "Bake at 375, smell cocoa, edges look dry but centers slightly puffed and soft. Too brown means burnt marshmallow. Pull trays quick, press mini marshmallows and candy bits on top right away. Rest for 5 mins on tray; toppings set sticky but stable. Don’t disturb or break."
- "If dough too soft, chill extra 15 min before scooping. Overheated kitchen or mixing too long? Dough turns sticky, harder to shape. Freeze balls on tray till solid before baking; prevents spread but needs room."
- "Substitute milk chocolate chunks with dark for bitter hit; more bitter pairing with walnuts. Butter can be swapped with coconut oil for dairy-free but expect slightly different crumb and flavor. No candy bars? Use chocolate chips plus pinch flaky salt atop after baking."
faq:
- "q: Can I skip freezing dough balls? a: Nope really. Freezing traps marshmallow inside. Without it, marsh melts out, cookies spread flat. Mess everywhere. Wait 30 mins at least. Tried warm dough once, disaster. Frozen holds shape better too."
- "q: What if marshmallows leak while baking? a: Check sealing process. Edges must be pinched tight. Rolling dough balls smooth helps. Also freeze dough solid first. Oven temp too high burns marshmallow fast. Use parchment or silicone mat to catch drips not scorched pan."
- "q: How do I store leftover cookies? a: Airtight container best but eat quick. Marshmallows dry out after 2 days. Can refrigerate also; might firm the marshmallow texture a bit. Avoid freezer if stored long-term, marshes get hard then. Reheat briefly if needed to soften goo."
- "q: Can I substitute nuts for allergy? a: Pecans or toasted hazelnuts work fine. Toasting nuts brings extra flavor but skip if nut allergies. Could omit nuts but loses crunch contrast. Adding a pinch sea salt on top after bake helps mimic nut crunch and flavor complexity."
