title: "Farfalle with Mushrooms and Crispy Pancetta"
slug: "farfalle-with-mushrooms"
description: "A twist on farfalle with wild mushrooms and smoky pancetta. The pancetta crisps up in the oven, lending a crunchy salty pop. Mixed mushrooms simmer in a sherry vinegar reduction with cream and fresh thyme, not rosemary. Shallots replace red onions for a milder sweetness. Toasted walnuts instead of hazelnuts, for earthiness. White wine trimmed down by broth and cream thickens into a luscious sauce clinging to perfectly al dente pasta. Parsley scattered at the end freshens the whole. Balance of textures, flavors. Simple yet complex. Changes in timing, ingredients and steps offer a more nuanced, rustic dish."
metaDescription: "Farfalle tossed with wild mushrooms, crispy pancetta baked in oven, creamy thyme-infused sauce thickened with broth and cream, topped with toasted walnuts and pecorino."
ogDescription: "Crunchy oven-pancetta meets mushrooms browned to golden, cream and thyme swirl into sauce thickened by broth. Walnuts add crunch, pecorino sharp finish."

ingredients:
- "10 slices thin pancetta or prosciutto, cut into strips"
- "3 small shallots, sliced thin"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "0.5 ml (1/8 tsp) crushed red pepper flakes"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "1.25 litre (5 cups) mixed mushrooms (chanterelles, oyster, cremini, shiitake), sliced"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) dry white wine"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) chicken or vegetable broth"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) crème fraîche or 35% cream"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) fresh thyme leaves, chopped"
- "375 g (3/4 lb) farfalle or other pasta shapes"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) freshly grated pecorino Romano"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) chopped flat-leaf parsley"
- "Coarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "50 ml (1/4 cup) toasted walnuts, roughly chopped"
- "Extra pecorino shavings for garnish"
- "Optional: 1 tsp sherry vinegar or lemon juice"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F). Line a baking tray with parchment paper."
- "Arrange pancetta strips spaced apart on tray. Bake 12-15 minutes until crisp and slightly browned edges. Watch for signs: curls, bubbling fat, deep color but no burning. Remove and drain on paper towels. Reserve."
- "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil for pasta."
- "Heat olive oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Stir often. Cook till translucent and fragrant, about 4 minutes. Shallots soften without browning, garlic just turning aromatic."
- "Add mushroom mix. Increase heat slightly to medium-high. Let mushrooms brown without stirring too much. Listen; gentle sizzling hints moisture evaporating. Stir occasionally. Cook about 7 minutes or until golden and reduced in volume."
- "Pour in wine and broth. Scrape pan bottom to deglaze any stuck bits—those browned fragments add depth. Simmer until liquid reduces by half, about 8-9 minutes. Sauce thickens but still loose. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking."
- "Lower heat and pour in cream and thyme. Simmer gently 5 minutes. Sauce should coat back of spoon. Season with salt, pepper, and optional sherry vinegar or a splash of lemon for brightness—it cuts richness."
- "Cook pasta until just before al dente, about 2 minutes less than package states. It will finish cooking in sauce. Reserve ½ cup pasta water before draining."
- "Add drained pasta to mushroom cream sauce. Toss gently, adding pasta water if sauce is too stiff. Stir in grated pecorino and parsley. Coating pasta evenly. Taste and adjust seasoning."
- "Plate. Divide pasta onto plates. Pile 2-3 pancetta strips decoratively in center. Sprinkle with toasted walnuts and pecorino shavings."
- "Serve immediately. Pancetta remains crispy against creamy mushroom-coated pasta. Walnuts bring crunch and nuttiness."
introduction: "Mushrooms and pancetta dancing; shallots swap in for onions— softer, sweeter bite. Heat sizzles, browns edges; scent deepens. Oven crisps pancetta evenly;  no pan splatter fuss. Mushrooms char, shrink, release earthy perfume. Thyme hums where rosemary once ruled. Sherry vinegar splash cuts creaminess—brightens, balances. Pasta barely cooked, finishes bathing, soaking in sauce depth. Walnuts toasted, add crunch. Pecorino sharp, salty, mingled with parsley freshness. Small shifts in timing, ingredients, steps—I’ve learned not to rush, to read pan and nose, to taste till just right. Texture battles richness fights freshness, all in mouth. It’s rustic but precise, fresh but indulgent."
ingredientsNote: "Use pancetta or prosciutto in thin slices—pancetta for fat and salt, prosciutto leans leaner, less fat renders but also less crunch. If pancetta too fatty, blot well to avoid greasy final bite. Shallots blend sweetness and mildness—can substitute one small red onion finely sliced but reduce quantity to avoid overpowering. Mixed mushrooms? Diversity is key. Cremini gives firmness, oyster gives silkiness, chanterelles add woodsy touch. Shiitake works beautifully too. For broth, vegetable stock works for vegetarian option, or chicken broth for deeper umami. Cream can be swapped with crème fraîche or even mascarpone for tangier finish. Thyme better than rosemary here—rosemary dries out cream faster, more assertive. Walnuts toasted on dry pan for few minutes, watch closely to prevent bitterness. Pecorino is sharper and saltier compared to parmigiano, brings nice punch. Parsley freshens. Adding a hint of acid at the end (sherry vinegar or lemon) balances richness and prevents dish from feeling heavy. Crucial: don’t overcook mushrooms, keep some texture. Pancetta crisps best in oven; pan-frying can cause uneven cooking and mess. "
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven before pancetta. Watch closely—oven temps vary. Pancetta should crisp fully without burning. Remove at first cracks in edges, coloring deepens off heat. For mushrooms, heat must be high enough to brown but not burn. Dry pan well before adding mushrooms. Overcrowding muscles steaming rather than browning—cook in batches if needed. Listen for sizzle and look for golden edges. Deglaze pan after mushrooms brown to capture all flavor bits left behind. Simmer off wine and broth slowly—too fast and sauce won't develop depth, too slow and mushrooms lose texture. Cream added low heat, stir gently to avoid splitting. Pasta timing critical—slightly undercook so it finishes resting in sauce, absorbs flavor. Keep reserved pasta water in case sauce is too thick, adds silkiness and helps sauce cling. Toss pasta immediately with sauce to coat. Season incrementally throughout—never too late. Adding cheese at the end adds salt and richness but too early can make sauce gluey. Rest pasta briefly to allow sauce to marry. Garnish with crunchy pancetta and nuts last minute—moisture ruins crunch. Serve hot but not scalding. Plate for contrast—nest pasta, stack pancetta, sprinkle nuts and shavings generously. Adds textures and aroma—increases curiosity to taste. All comes together visually and in mouth."
tips:
- "Use thin slices pancetta not thick slabs. Oven crisps evenly; pan-frying risks uneven bits, greasy spots. Watch curls, sizzling fat. Pull out once edges crack—removes bitterness from overcooking. Drain on paper towels, blot excess fat to avoid greasy bites later."
- "Shallots swap red onions—milder, sweeter, less sharp aromatics. Slice thin for quick softening. Cook gently with garlic and red pepper flakes till translucent, not browning. Garlic just turning aromatic, not burnt. Timing cues aroma changes, soft texture."
- "Mushroom mix chosen for texture variety—chanterelles, shiitakes give distinct woodsiness, cremini add firmness, oyster silkiness. Dry pan very well before adding mushrooms. Avoid overcrowding; steam not brown. Stir occasionally to catch golden edges and sizzle sound indicating moisture loss."
- "Deglaze after mushrooms brown using wine and broth. Scrape pan bottom to lift browned fragments—they add flavor depth. Simmer to reduce liquid by half; sauce thickens but stays loose. Stir off heat to prevent burning. Add cream and thyme low heat; prevent splitting by gentle stirring."
- "Pasta slightly undercook by about 2 minutes. Finishes cooking in sauce, absorbs flavor better. Keep ½ cup pasta water before draining; add if sauce thickens or stiffness appears. Toss pasta immediately in sauce to coat evenly. Add cheese and parsley last to keep texture bright but well mixed."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute pancetta? a: Use prosciutto or guanciale if pancetta unavailable. Prosciutto leaner, less fat renders, less crisp but still flavor. Guanciale fattier, richer but can overpower if not sliced thin. Oven crisping method still applies. Avoid thick cuts to keep texture right."
- "q: What if mushrooms overcook? a: Mushrooms get slimy when crowded or too long on heat. Solution: cook in batches if pan small. Watch for edges drying and gentle sizzle sound is key—if stew forms, moisture too high. Drain liquid or increase heat briefly. Texture important; some chew remains."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Pasta best eaten same day. If storing, refrigerate in airtight container up to 2 days. Reheat gently to avoid sauce breaking—low heat with splash of broth or water. Pancetta loses crispness; can re-crisp in oven separately before serving again."
- "q: Can I swap cream for dairy-free? a: Coconut cream or cashew cream OK but changes flavor profile. Use mild versions, keep thyme element for herbal hint. Reduce liquid amount slightly; dairy-free creams sometimes thinner. Add slowly, watch sauce consistency during simmer."
