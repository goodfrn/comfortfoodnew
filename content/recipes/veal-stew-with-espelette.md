ingredients:
- "1 large onion, thinly sliced"
- "4 cloves garlic, finely minced"
- "2 green bell peppers, seeded and diced"
- "4 red bell peppers, seeded and diced"
- "4 yellow bell peppers, seeded and diced"
- "70 ml (just under 1/3 cup) olive oil"
- "950 g (just over 2 pounds) veal shoulder, cut into small cubes"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "50 ml (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) fresh parsley, chopped"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) fresh thyme, chopped"
- "Espelette pepper or hot smoked paprika, to taste"
- "110 ml (just under 1/2 cup) low-sodium vegetable broth (chicken broth substitute)"
- "salt and black pepper freshly ground"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil over medium-low in heavy casserole. Toss in onions, garlic, peppers. Cook stirring occasionally around 12 minutes till onions translucent and peppers slightly softened but not mushy. Aromas should bloom, garlic just turning golden but no browning. This slow sweat pulls out sweetness and builds flavor base."
- "Push veggies aside, add cubed veal in single layer. Brown gently, no rush, about 6-8 minutes until edges firm and blush to light brown. Avoid overcrowding or meat steams instead, losing texture."
- "Toss bay leaves, parsley, thyme into pot. Sprinkle Espelette pepper or smoked paprika now; spice aroma hits immediately. Season with salt and lots of cracked black pepper. Stir everything to mix herbs and spices well."
- "Pour in vegetable broth. Just enough to moisten; not submerging meat. Bring to simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover partially — keep a little vent so steam escapes without drying. The stew should bubble softly, not boil hard."
- "Simmer 60 minutes, stir every 15 minutes watching liquid level. Meat will start feeling tender, fibers loosening but still holding shape. After 50 minutes, uncover to reduce juices around 10 minutes until sauce thickens and coats ingredients lightly, glossy finish."
- "Taste and adjust seasoning, more Espelette if needed for kick. If sauce too thin, continue reduction uncovered. Too thick? Splash broth or water."
- "Serve with steamed or pan-fried potatoes. Optionally, dice pre-cooked potatoes into stew in first step with onions to absorb flavors—or serve on side to keep textures separate."
- "Watch for cues: onions should be soft with translucent hue; peppers tender but vivid; veal fork-tender and juices reduced to silky sauce. Avoid overcooking, meat becomes stringy and dry."
- "Cleanup tip: soak spoon and pot quickly to loosen garlic and pepper oils."
introduction: "Mid-thought. Veal stew with peppers screams color. Onions sweating slow. Garlic scent sticky sweet in oil. The peppers, vibrating bright greens and reds, needing just that soft give, not collapse. Veal shoulder, cubed — the backbone, the chewy joy that melts over hour-long bubbles. Espelette pepper brings the punch, not just heat but character. Substitute smoked paprika when in a pinch. Broth, barely enough to bathe. Watch the pot — not about minutes, about feel—poke the meat, watch the sauce cling, hear the steady simmer, tickle your nose. Potatoes optional, can go right in or hug the side steaming. Skip them? Sauce thicker, flavors bolder. No rush. The glory’s in the slow. Too hot, meat turns tough; too cold and stew stalls. Techniques learned after many a ruined batch. I listen to my senses, not the clock. Stew vibrates life, cooks with mood, patience, and senses. This one’s French stubborn comfort, loaded with peppers' crunch and veal’s tender heart."
ingredientsNote: "Onions and garlic—go for large and fresh; the flavor base depends on their sweetness and texture. I bumped olive oil a touch to compensate for peppers soaking flavor. Peppers should be firm, not wrinkly to avoid soggy stew. Veal shoulder is forgiving, but trim any excessive fat or silver skin to prevent chewiness—if you can’t get veal, a good pork shoulder works too, though flavor shifts. Bay leaves add that woody fragrance but don’t skip thyme and parsley; fresh herbs punch through the stew’s richness. Espelette pepper has nuanced kick, but smoked paprika is a clever swap adding smoky warmth without fire; adjust amounts based on your heat tolerance. Broth quantity less than usual to keep sauce thick. Potatoes optional—cut and add early for starch-thickened stew or cook separately if you want different textures. Salt well at start, then adjust as broth reduces; it concentrates and could get salty fast if you’re careless."
instructionsNote: "Start slow—flicker heat, patient stir. Onions should glisten, no browning, garlic softening but not burnt—tiny burnt bits ruin whole pot. When adding meat, spread cubes in one layer to brown nicely. You want medium-low heat, avoid steaming meat or you lose that caramelized flavor. Herbs always in early to infuse rather than dumped later. Espelette pepper immediately wakes aroma; paprika changes profile but still works great. Watch bubbling; too fierce and molecules break down to mush, too low and cooking stalls. The half-covered step is crucial to avoid drying or watery stew. Near end, uncover and listen—liquid should thicken, liquid bubbles slow and steady, glossy shine on surface—this is your texture gauge. Second guessing thickness? Stir—if juices cling and coat, you nailed it. Taste test before serving—veal flavor should be rich and assertive, veggies softened but vibrant. If potatoes added, they should be tender but intact, not starchy mush. Trust your senses here more than timers; every stovetop’s different. Lastly, clean as you go. Garlic clings like a magnet if left too long."
tips:
- "Start low heat with onions and garlic. Slow sweat till onions turn translucent, garlic softens but no browning. Watch aromas here. Not mushy peppers—just softened edges. This sets base flavor, patience key. If veggies crisp up, oil too hot. Adjust heat immediately. Timing varies by pan size and stove. No rush on this stage or lose sweetness."
- "Brown veal cubes carefully. Single layer in pot; overcrowding means steaming not browning. Edges turn light brown, that blush means caramelization starting. Avoid high heat; too fast will toughen meat outside but raw inside. Six to eight minutes typical. Avoid moving cubes too early; let crust form then flip or stir gently for even color."
- "Herbs add earthiness but add early with spices. Bay leaves, parsley, thyme go in before simmer for infusion. Espelette chili or smoked paprika sprinkled now—aroma should hit fast, spicy but nuanced. If spice too strong, add broth later to mellow. Salt well but cautiously; broth reduction concentrates saltiness. Black pepper cracked fresh adds bite, do not skip."
- "Simmer covered partially keeps moisture with vent to avoid dryness. Watch for soft bubbling, not full boil. Stir every 15 minutes. Around 50 minutes, uncover to reduce liquid and thicken. Sauce should cling lightly; glossy finish signals correct texture. Too watery? Keep uncovered longer. Too thick? Splash vegetable broth or water sparingly to loosen."
- "Potatoes optional. Dice pre-cooked to add early if you want starch-thickened stew; they soak up flavor but soften fast. Or steam/fry separately on side to keep texture contrast. Avoid raw potatoes with long simmer; they break down creating mushy stew. If adding potatoes, salt less at start; starch changes seasoning needs. Timing and texture monitoring crucial here."
faq:
- "q: What if I don’t have Espelette chili? a: Swap smoked paprika, adds smoky warmth, less heat but depth. Could combine small pinch cayenne with smoked paprika if you want more bite. Ground black pepper alone dulls flavor layers. Best to add spice early, aroma builds through simmer."
- "q: How to avoid dry veal? a: Slow cooking low heat. No rushing browning—browning crust protects moisture. Watch liquid level throughout. Partial cover with vent helps keep steam without drowning meat. Overboiling toughens fibers. Meat fibers relax when gently simmered—poke with fork to check doneness. If stringy, likely overheated or cooked too long with no moisture."
- "q: Can I substitute veal with another meat? a: Pork shoulder works well, similar texture and fat content. Adjust cook time slightly; pork may need less simmering. Beef stew meat might overpower subtle pepper flavors. Lamb less common here but possible. Trim fat to prevent greasy stew; silver skin removal important for chewiness."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, store airtight in fridge up to three days. Reheat gently on low; avoid boiling again. Sauce thickens on standing—add splash broth or water to loosen on reheat. Freeze in portion sized containers, best consumed within two months. Thaw slow in fridge overnight for best texture retention."
