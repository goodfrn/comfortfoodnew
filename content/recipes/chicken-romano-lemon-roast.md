description: "Chicken breasts coated in a tangy lemon-fennel mixture roasted alongside sliced potatoes and zucchini. The dish uses manchego cheese instead of pecorino, swapping courge poivrée for zucchini. Mayonnaise for a zesty creaminess. A quick broil to crisp skin, aniseed fragrance mixing with citrus. Achieves a balance between tender chicken and crispy potatoes. Oven times adjusted slightly for perfect doneness. Aromas guide you more than clocks. A simple twist on classic lemon chicken."

ingredients:
- "1 clove garlic minced"
- "1 lemon zest finely grated"
- "40 ml juice from 1 lemon"
- "20 g manchego cheese grated, plus extra for serving"
- "20 ml mayonnaise"
- "7.5 ml ground fennel seeds"
- "2.5 ml cracked black pepper"
- "650 g boneless skinless chicken breasts (approx 4 small halves)"
- "2 large potatoes sliced about 1 cm thick"
- "1 small zucchini halved and quartered"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "Fresh dill chopped for garnish"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack to middle and preheat oven to 225 C"
- "Mix garlic, lemon zest, half lemon juice, manchego, mayonnaise, ground fennel, black pepper, plus salt to taste in large bowl. Toss chicken breasts, coat thoroughly. Let rest while prepping veg"
- "On baking sheet, combine potatoes, zucchini, remaining lemon juice, olive oil. Season with salt, pepper all over. Roast 20 minutes until potatoes start browning and zucchini releases aroma"
- "Remove sheet, spread veggies away from center edges. Nestle marinated chicken centrally, skin side up if using skin on (or smooth side up). Return to oven for another 17 minutes or until chicken firms to touch, juices clear when pierced"
- "Switch to broil, about 4 minutes. Watch for golden crust on chicken, potato edges crisped, zucchini slightly charred at tips"
- "Scatter dill and extra cheese right before serving"
introduction: "Zestier. Sharper cheese punch with manchego over pecorino. Tried courge poivrée before — dry. Zucchini lends moisture, slight sweetness. Cayenne green and firmer texture. Garlic presence here mild but noticeable. Mayonnaise isn’t just fat; it binds and browns chicken beautifully. Broiling seals browned crust; crucial for texture you don’t get roasting alone. Watch juices, not the clock. Oven heat differs, size of breasts varies — practice makes perfect. Potatoes should show rough brown spots, not limp. You’ll smell fennel spice blooming as it cooks. Don’t skip dill finish — brightens. The layering of citrus and fennel is key. Chicken skin optional but I skip it for quicker cook and cleaner mouthfeel."
ingredientsNote: "Choosing manchego replaces pecorino’s punch with nutty but less salty flavor. Parmesan can swap if needed but dial salt accordingly. Ground fennel seeds bring more anise nuance than whole seeds; grinding fresh is ideal but store ground in air-tight container works. Black pepper freshly cracked for texture and pop. Mayonnaise here isn’t just creamy; it helps cheese adhere and browns the chicken in the oven’s intense heat. Zucchini preferred over courge poivrée for tenderness and subtle sweetness. Potatoes thicker than 1 cm risk raw centers; thinner means mush. Olive oil must be good quality; cheap oils burn and smell off. Lemon zest and juice fresh and unwaxed for bright citrus aroma. Dill fresh — dried too woody and weak. Garlic minced fine so it melds; no chunks."
instructionsNote: "Oven temp hotter than usual for roasting ensures crisp edges but watch veggies. Potatoes first get a head start to develop fond. Resting chicken in marinade while veggies roast allows flavors to penetrate without over-salting. Position chicken in center for even heat contact. Broiling at end creates contrast between soft inside and crisp outside, prevents drying. Peel thickness affects cooking time; poke thickest part to test doneness — juices should run clear. Don’t disturb chicken during cook; let crust form uninterrupted. If broil seems too fierce, move rack lower or reduce time by a minute. Using aluminium foil on tray helps cleanup but choose heavy duty — avoid tearing. Stir veggies halfway if necessary but better to leave undisturbed. Aromas signaling readiness include fennel, lemon freshness, roasting potato sweetness."
tips:
- "Oven at 225 C hotter than usual. Start potatoes first then add zucchini and chicken. Potatoes need head start for browning. Watch sizzling sounds; potatoes will crisp edges before color change visible. Don’t crowd pan, steam kills crispness."
- "Mayo in marinade does more than bind; helps cheese stick and boosts browning. If no mayo, Greek yogurt or Dijon mustard works but affects browning. Coat chicken evenly, let rest so flavors soak. Leaving some dry spots changes crust texture, avoid that."
- "Grind fennel fresh when possible for pop; store ground in airtight but loses aroma fast. Black pepper freshly cracked brings tactile pop, not just heat. Use more/less based on preference but texture vital. Salt late, avoid over-salting chicken or veg separately."
- "Broiling at end is crucial; roasting alone misses crisp skin. Four minutes usual but rack height matters; move down if broil too fierce. Watch closely, golden crust forms fast. If unsure, peel thickest part of chicken, juices clear mean done. No juice change, wait more."
- "Zucchini swaps courge poivrée for moisture and sweetness; watery zucchini drains slightly or salt it first to avoid soggy sheet. Slice potatoes about 1 cm thick; thicker risks raw centers, thinner mushy. Fresh lemon zest best, dried lacks punch. Dill fresh bright finish, no substitutes."
faq:
- "q: Why the mayo in chicken coating? a: Mayo helps cheese stick better; also browns chicken skin in oven heat. You can swap for yogurt or Dijon mustard but browning lighter. Adds tang too."
- "q: Can I use different cheese? a: Manchego nutty less salty than pecorino. Parmesan possible but adjust salt more. Avoid super soft cheeses here, affects coating texture and roast outcome."
- "q: What if potatoes aren’t crisp? a: Too crowded pan or oil coarse. Cut evenly about 1 cm thick. Start roasting potatoes alone to dry surface before adding chicken and zucchini. Don’t stir too often."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerator in airtight container best. Reheat uncovered in oven for texture. Avoid microwave or soggy skin. Can freeze but expect texture loss on veg, chicken stays better frozen whole."
