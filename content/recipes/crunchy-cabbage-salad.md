ingredients:
- "1.2 litre (5 cups) green cabbage, chopped chunky"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) red cabbage, shredded"
- "200 ml (¾ cup) purple kohlrabi, grated fine"
- "150 ml (⅔ cup) radish, julienned thin"
- "20 ml (1 ½ tbsp) kosher salt"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) demerara sugar"
- "3 scallions, thin sliced"
- "80 ml (⅓ cup) mayonnaise"
- "60 ml (¼ cup) crème fraîche"
- "40 ml (2 ½ tbsp) yuzu vinegar"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) whole grain mustard"
- "3 ml (½ tsp) celery salt"
- "fresh black pepper, to taste"
- "fresh dill, chopped (optional twist)"
- "extra virgin olive oil, drizzle (optional twist)"
instructions:
- "1 Combine green and red cabbage with coarse salt and sugar in a large colander. Toss well with hands - the salt will start to soften the leaves after a few minutes. Let rest 3-4 hours in fridge to draw out moisture and mellow bitterness. Watch the cabbages soften but still hold crunch; don’t overdo or it’ll turn soggy."
- "2 After chilling, rinse the cabbage thoroughly under cold running water to wash away excess salt and sugar. Spin in a salad spinner or pat dry tightly with kitchen towel to remove excess water — moisture ruins texture and dilutes dressing."
- "3 Transfer cabbage to a large mixing bowl. Add grated kohlrabi, julienned radish, and finely sliced scallions. Mix gently but thoroughly for even flavor and texture."
- "4 In a separate small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, crème fraîche, yuzu vinegar, whole grain mustard, celery salt, and cracked black pepper into a thick, creamy dressing. Taste and adjust acidity or seasoning. The yuzu vinegar should give a gentle citrus punch without overpowering."
- "5 Toss the dressing into the cabbage mixture. Fold to coat evenly — no wilting, the crunch is key here. If you notice liquid pooling, add a touch of olive oil to bind."
- "6 Fold in chopped fresh dill for an herbaceous note that lifts the salad and adds complexity. Optional but a twist I swear by for brightness."
- "7 Cover with plastic wrap and chill 15-20 minutes before serving, allowing flavors to meld but salad still crisp. Do not wait too long or cabbage starts weeping water."
- "8 Serve cold. Perfect side with grilled meats or as a light lunch. Holds well but best eaten within 24 hours—after that texture fades."
introduction: "Crunchy cabbage salad, never flat or soggy, always punchy. One time I left prep too short, ended up with limp mush. That salty-sweet rub before chilling draws out just enough moisture. Tried shiitake mushrooms last winter. Meh. Purple kohlrabi’s a game changer. Adds crisp, almost peppery bite. Radishes bring earth and heat in the crunch layer. Not just a salad, a texture workout. Creamy dressing thick but not gluey, with sharp citrus notes from yuzu. The aroma of fresh dill? Opens up the palate without stealing thunder. Keep it cold, keep it fresh—no mushy regrets here. Cabbage, if used well, sings in complexity."
ingredientsNote: "Salt and sugar aren’t just seasoning here—they’re tools to soften the cabbage’s backbone a bit without killing crunch. Use kosher or coarse salt; table salt’s too fast and harsh. Yuzu vinegar or good quality rice vinegar works; anything too harsh throws off delicate balance. Mayonnaise can be swapped for Greek yogurt, but check tang levels. Crème fraîche adds body without too much sourness; sour cream is a backup but heavier. Kohlrabi is a twist replacing carrots here—check for firmness, the fresher the better. Radishes are a spicy crisp contrast, skip if you’re short but don’t replace with milder veggie or risk dullness. Celery salt is subtle but adds umami hint; use celery seeds ground if out. Scallions provide freshness, can swap with chives or leeks. Fresh dill? Optional, but don’t skip if you want layered aroma. Olive oil drizzle optional to smooth dress and prevent separation especially if dressing sits long."
instructionsNote: "Start by combining cabbages with salt and sugar—don’t rush this. Hands-on tossing crushes fibers to release water slowly. The 3-4 hours in fridge isn’t just resting—it’s timing the texture shift; watch for pliable-but-still-crispy. Rinse carefully to remove excess salt yet leave flavor. Spin dry well; soggy leaves kill the texture and waters down the dressing, a rookie mistake I learned the hard way. Add the kohlrabi and radish after drying, mixing gently to not bruise. Dressing is a balancing act—whisk ingredients into a creamy emulsion and taste often. Yuzu vinegar is bright but subtle; too much is bitter. Toss lightly, folding not crushing. Dill goes in last to avoid wilting. Chill briefly to unify flavors, but serve immediately after to preserve crackle. Holds in fridge max a day, after that juice separates and texture mutes."
tips:
- "Salt and sugar rub crucial—use kosher salt; table salt too fast, ruins texture. Toss by hand, crush fibers slowly. Rest 3-4 hours fridge. Watch crunch not mush; texture shifts gradually—feel leaves pliable but firm. Moisture draws out bright bitterness fades; rinse right after or dressing too salty."
- "Spin dry cabbage thoroughly. Water kills all crunch, waters down dressing immediately. Use salad spinner or pat towel tight tight. Add kohlrabi and radish after drying seriously. Mix gentle no bruising or muddy mess. Texture is multi-layered; don’t mash or pulp ingredients."
- "Whisk dressing creamy but not gluey. Yuzu vinegar bright but subtle punch—too much overwhelms. Mix mayo with crème fraîche for body and slight tang. Mustard whole grain adds grip and umami hint. Taste often, adjust salt and tang slowly. Dressing thick coats cabbage but doesn’t drown it."
- "Fold dressing gently into veggies. Crunch key; no crushing. Watch for pooling liquid—add olive oil drizzle to bind if needed. Olive oil optional but helpful in this step. Dill goes last; fresh herb aroma opens flavor but don’t mix too early or wilt. Chill briefly 15-20 min max—flavors marry but no sogginess."
- "Timing is everything chilling. 3-4 hours for salt-sugar rub, rinse and dry, dress, then just minutes cold before serving. Wait too long and leaves sweat, lose crackle. Keeps max 24 hours fridge wrapped. Texture fades fast. If soggy, salvage with fresh cabbage added late or fresh acid splash."
faq:
- "q: How to stop cabbage from soggy? a: Salt-sugar rub long enough—3 hours min. Don’t rush rinsing after soak, water out well. Dry well. Dress last moment. Chill short time only. Extra olive oil binds liquid if separates."
- "q: Can I swap kohlrabi? a: Yes but check firmness. Carrots work but milder—may lose peppery bite. Radish optional but crunch needed or goes flat. Use firm veggies to maintain layered crunch. Avoid soft or watery substitutes."
- "q: What if dressing breaks? a: Whisk slowly. Use room temp mayo and crème fraîche. Add vinegar gradual. If breaks, add a spoon mayonnaise or cold water and whisk hard fast. Can rescue with extra mustard for emulsifying too."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Airtight in fridge max 1 day. Use glass or sealed container. Olive oil helps extend freshness. Can add fresh cabbage next day if limp. Avoid storing too long or texture collapses. Serve cold straight after chilling."
