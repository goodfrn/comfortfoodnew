ingredients:
- "560 g  (3 cups) new potatoes"
- "50 g  (1.5 cups) mixed fresh herbs (tarragon, chives, dill)"
- "20 ml  (1 c. tbsp) Dijon mustard"
- "30 ml  (2 tbsp) crème fraîche"
- "30 ml  (2 tbsp) basil pesto"
- "1/2 lime zest only"
- "salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Fill a pot with potatoes and herbs. Add salt. Cover with water."
- "Bring to a boil. Simmer about 25 minutes until potatoes yield to a fork but still firm."
- "Drain. Discard herbs. Rinse potatoes under cold water briefly. Set aside to cool to warm."
- "Zest lime. In a medium bowl whisk together mustard, crème fraîche, pesto, lime zest, salt, and pepper."
- "Cut potatoes in halves or quarters depending on size. Add to bowl and fold into dressing gently but thoroughly."
- "Serve immediately at room temp or let rest chilled for 15 minutes. Flavors settle better."
introduction: "Potatoes. Herbs. Creamy. Bright lime zest. Tangy Dijon kick. Not your usual mayo base. Tarragon swapped for parsley. Lighter herb load. Cooler boil time. Rinsed quick to stop cooking. Halved or quartered spuds catch dressing better. Basil pesto's herbal tie-in. Crème fraîche for softness. A salad, not mush. Room temperature or chilled, your call. Fresh herbs chopped fine or rustic. Mix equals texture, taste, and zing. Quick, simple, no fuss. Just bite into soft spuds bathed in creamy herby goodness. Add on a sunny day picnic or lunch plate."
ingredientsNote: "Choose new potatoes or small waxy types for holding shape. Reduce herbs slightly, use fresh tarragon instead of parsley to add subtle anise notes. Dijon mustard replaces mayonnaise lowering fat and adding sharpness. Crème fraîche swapped for sour cream for a silkier texture. Pesto unaltered but you can play with sun-dried tomato versions for color splash. Lime zest only, no juice, keeps salad bright without watering. Remember to salt cooking water for seasoning from inside out. Keep herb size rustic or fine depending on bite preference. Quantity changes maintain flavor balance without overpowering potato's mildness."
instructionsNote: "Combine potatoes and herbs in salted water, boil slightly shortened for firmer bites. Rinse immediately to stop cooking, prevents sogginess. Discard herbs, don’t blend herb leaves into salad. In separate bowl whisk a mustard base with crème fraîche, pesto, and lime zest for complexity. Do not overmix potatoes or they’ll break apart. Add potatoes while warm to dressing to absorb flavor better. Serve at room temperature or after quick chilling to let herbs infuse dressing. Tweak salt and pepper last; fresh lime zest can dominate if too much. Easy to adjust herb types or add minced shallots for crunch if so desired."
tips:
- "Boil potatoes with fresh herbs in salted water to infuse flavor from inside out. Keep cooking time less than usual. Aim for potatoes firm to fork but not crunchy. Rinse quickly with cold water after draining. Stop cooking fast prevents softness turning mushy. Discard herb sprigs. Keep herb leaves separate for dressing not water flavor."
- "Mustard replaces mayo for tang, lowers fat and adds sharpness. Whisk together Dijon, crème fraîche, and pesto before potatoes go in. Add lime zest, salt, pepper next. Zest only, no juice or salad can get watery, brightness stays concentrated. Mixing warm potatoes helps them absorb dressing better. Fold gently, don’t mash."
- "Herb choices matter. Use fresh tarragon for subtle anise over parsley, lighter load keeps balance. Mix with chives and dill to layer herb notes without overpowering. Chop herbs coarse or fine based on mouthfeel. Rustic chunks for texture. Fine for smooth herbal notes. Keep herbs out of cooking water after boiling, discard sprigs, add fresh to dressing."
- "Cut potatoes into halves or quarters depending on size. Larger pieces catch dressing better, prevent breakdown. Avoid overmixing or salad turns gluey. Serve warm or chilled. Room temp works too, salad settles and flavors meld without becoming heavy. Rest in fridge 15 mins for herbs infuse dressing deeper. Adjust salt/pepper at end, lime zest can dominate if too much."
- "Use waxy new potatoes or similar small sizes for consistency. Avoid starchy kinds that fall apart when boiled. Shorter cook time keeps firm texture. Rinse drains heat quickly, prevents carryover cooking. Crème fraîche gives silkier texture than sour cream alternative. Basil pesto unchanged here but swapping sun-dried tomato version adds color and pungency if wanted."
faq:
- "q: Can I use regular mustard instead of Dijon? a: Regular works but flavor less sharp. Dijon sharper, tangier, more balanced. Could muddle herbs. Add less to start then adjust. Different mustard styles vary, test small batch first for taste."
- "q: Why rinse potatoes after boiling? a: Stops cooking immediately. Keeps potatoes from getting mushy. Drains away excess starch so texture firm. Prevents salad soggy. Quick cold rinse cools fast. If skipped, residual heat softens spuds more than wanted."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Keeps 2-3 days best. Dressing thickens when cold but warms fine. Can add splash water or extra crème fraîche before serving. Avoid freezing - potatoes texture ruins. Serve chilled or room temp."
- "q: Can I swap herbs or add extras? a: Yes, flexible herbs choice. Tarragon key for subtle anise. Parsley swap common. Chives dill also good. Shallots or green onions add crunch if mixed in. Try sun-dried tomato pesto for variation. Herbs fresh, no cooked herbs in final mix for bright flavor."
