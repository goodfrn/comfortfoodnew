ingredients:
- "270 ml (1 1/8 cup) almond meal"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) quick cooking oatmeal flakes"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) packed brown sugar"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) whole wheat flour"
- "7 ml (1 1/2 tsp) baking powder"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) baking soda"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) salt"
- "2 large eggs"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) plain Greek yogurt"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) peeled and grated apple (around 1 medium apple)"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) fresh or frozen blueberries"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) chopped walnuts (optional replacement for sliced almonds)"
instructions:
- "Position oven rack mid-level. Preheat oven to 175 °C (347 °F). Line 12 muffin cups with liners or grease well."
- "In large bowl, whisk together almond meal, oats, brown sugar, whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside."
- "In separate bowl, beat eggs with Greek yogurt. Stir in grated apple."
- "Add wet mixture to dry ingredients. Mix gently until just combined; do not overmix."
- "Carefully fold in blueberries, keeping batter lumpy but uniform."
- "Divide batter evenly into muffin cups. Sprinkle tops with chopped walnuts for texture."
- "Bake 28 to 30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean with few crumbs attached."
- "Cool in pan 10 minutes before transferring to rack."
- "Store muffins in airtight container in cool, dry place up to 2 days. Texture best day of baking."
introduction: "Almond meal, oats, and whole wheat flour. Nutty base, filling texture. Brown sugar adds sweetness with a slight molasses kick. Eggs and Greek yogurt combine, thick apple grated in. Blueberries fresh or frozen, popping bursts. Walnuts swapped for sliced almonds. Crunch on top. Mixing careful — don’t over beat. Muffin tops cracked and golden. Oven waits, timer set to just under half hour. Muffins cool then eaten fast. Keep sealed, day two still okay but fading."
ingredientsNote: "Almond meal replaces traditional white flour for more texture and healthy fats. Quick oats give chewiness but won’t make muffins dense. Brown sugar mellows tart fruits like blueberries. Whole wheat flour adds fiber, some earthiness. Baking powder and soda for lift. Greek yogurt for moisture and slight tang. Apple grated without peeling to keep nutrients and texture; peeled can be used for milder texture. Blueberries fresh or frozen works, frozen should be thawed and drained. Topping nuts optional — here swapped sliced almonds for chopped walnuts providing crunch and nuttiness without overpowering. Adjust sugar slightly if fruits too tart."
instructionsNote: "Heat oven well in advance, racks placed middle. Use liners or grease well to prevent sticking. Mix dry ingredients thoroughly before adding wet. Then add wet to dry only until no dry spots remain, do not over stir or muffins toughen. Folding blueberries in carefully preserves shape, color, and prevents bleeding into batter. Measure batter evenly for uniform baking. Sprinkle nuts on top before baking for texture contrast. Oven times vary with altitude and oven type so check at 28 minutes. Toothpick method helps avoid under or over baking. Cool in pan first to stabilize structure, then to wire rack to cool completely. Store in airtight container, avoid refrigeration which dries muffins out."
tips:
- "Oven preheat crucial before mixing. Temperature steady at 175 °C. Muffin liners or grease spots? Liner safer. Prevents sticking, easier clean. Greasing? Use oil or butter lightly only."
- "Mix dry ingredients first: almond meal, oats, whole wheat, sugar, baking agents, salt. Whisk for even rise. No lumps. Avoid overmixing after wet added - stops tough muffins."
- "Wet mix next: eggs and Greek yogurt beaten smooth before adding grated apple. Apple peeled or not? Affects texture and nutrition. Grate fine for moisture, uneven chunks create uneven cooking."
- "Fold blueberries in last. Frozen should be thawed to prevent color bleed. Blueberries delicate; overfolding crushes berries, turns batter purple and flat. Lumpy batter fine - keeps muffin tender."
- "Topping nuts optional. Sliced almonds swapped for walnuts here. Chop walnuts small, sprinkle just before baking to keep crunch. Nut oils toast slightly adding aroma. Can skip topping but loses crunch."
faq:
- "q: Can frozen blueberries be used? a: Yes frozen work but drain thawed berries well. Avoid water in batter, or muffins soggy. Fold gently to keep berries intact. Fresh preferable but frozen fine."
- "q: What if muffins are too dense? a: Likely over mixing. Mix wet and dry until just combined. Over beating develops gluten in whole wheat flour, tough texture. Check baking powder freshness, too."
- "q: How store muffins best? a: Airtight container room temp ideal. Avoid fridge, dries muffins fast. Two days max usually without texture loss. Freeze individually wrapped if longer storage needed."
- "q: Can I replace walnuts with another nut? a: Yes chopped pecans or almonds. Toast nuts lightly before sprinkling for better aroma. Omit if allergies present or nuts not at hand."
