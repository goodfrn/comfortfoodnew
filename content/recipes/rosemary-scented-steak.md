ingredients:
- "bifteck d’aloyau (T-Bone) about 3 cm thick, room temp 20 minutes"
- "7 ml fleur de sel (1 ½ tsp)"
- "8 fresh rosemary branches"
- "10 ml olive oil"
- "6 small thyme sprigs"
instructions:
- "Set grill to high heat. Oil grill bars lightly."
- "Tie rosemary and thyme into 3 small bundles. Brush bundles with oil, sprinkle lightly with fleur de sel."
- "Season steak on both sides using fleur de sel only. Do not add oil or black pepper."
- "Place steak on grill. Cook 6 minutes each side or to preferred doneness slightly adjusted (+1 min each side)."
- "Add herb bundles to grill during last minute of steak cooking time. Grill 20 seconds each side till leaves brighten."
- "Remove steak, place on serving plate over 2 herb bundles. Rub top steak surface with final herb bundle for flavor."
- "Let rest loosely covered 8 minutes before slicing and serving."
introduction: "Steak thick cut. Some time at room temp—less than usual to keep freshness. No black pepper anywhere here, just salt. Fresh rosemary bundles. Thyme toss in for twist, subtle but noticeable. Grilling both meat and herbs together. Smoke hits herbs, oils out, aroma transfers. Herb bundles tied tight, not loose. Only two herbs changed. Olive oil instead of none — light glaze, not greasy. Timing tweaked a little - more grill on meat, less on herbs by seconds. Steak rubbed after with last herb bundle, instead of during cooking. Resting shorter. Keeps juice, not dry."
ingredientsNote: "Use sirloin or rib-eye 3 cm thick or slightly less. Let warm up fewer minutes so it doesn’t sweat or get too soft. Fleur de sel remains best salt for robust flavor without bitterness. Rosemary pairs with thyme now, thyme works better grilled with rosemary dark tang. Olive oil brushes herb bundles, light coating for grilling and prevents burning. No oil on meat, stays natural with only salt seasoning. Amounts reduced about a third to keep proportions in balance with thinner steak and shorter resting. Bundles fewer, smaller. Ideal for open grill or barbecue. No pepper to avoid bitter burnt taste on the fat with herbs."
instructionsNote: "High heat on grill essential for good crust. Oil grill bars so steak won’t stick, no oil on meat itself. Season with fleur de sel before grilling on both sides, only salt keeps flavors sharp. Tie rosemary and thyme tight into 3 small bunches, brush lightly with olive oil and sprinkle salt so they crisp quickly but don’t burn. Steak cooks 6 minutes each side for medium rare, plus one minute more each side than original. Herb bundles grilled at steak end, twenty seconds tops each side. Remove steak and place on two herb bundles for infusion as it rests. Final bundle rubbed over steak instead of just placing on top, gives extra surface aroma. Rest 8 minutes loosely tented to keep temperature and juice. Slicing after resting keeps meat tender and juicy."
tips:
- "Use thick steak cut, around 3 cm. Let it warm slightly. Fresh, room temperature is essential. Don’t let it sweat or soften. Dry is better for grilling."
- "Adjust cooking times based on thickness. 6 minutes per side for medium rare—add a minute if needed. Essential for good crust. Use high heat always."
- "Grill the herb bundles briefly—20 seconds each side is enough. Crisp leaves, then take off. Rosemary and thyme work well together. Use fleur de sel."
- "Olive oil should not touch meat. It changes flavor. Just salt enhanced by grilling. Focus on that smoky aroma from the herbs. Key to the dish."
- "Resting time matters. Let steak rest loosely covered. This keeps juices from escaping. 8 minutes is ideal. Cut after resting to maintain tenderness."

- "q: What type of steak is best? a: Sirloin or rib-eye works. Thickness is key. Aim for 3 cm or less. Tender cuts help with grilling."
- "q: How to achieve perfect doneness? a: Time each side carefully. Adjust for personal preferences. Use thermometer for precision. 130°F for rare."
- "q: Can I use other herbs? a: Yes, but rosemary and thyme are ideal. They complement beef well. Consider sage or parsley too, but flavors vary."
- "q: What about leftovers? a: Store in airtight container. Refrigerate within two hours. Last for 3-4 days. Reheat gently to avoid drying out."
