slug: "turkey-pineapple-roast"
description: "A 2.5 kg turkey breast roast brined and stuffed with a savory-sweet mixture featuring sausage, cranberries, pistachios and pineapple. The meat is butterfly-cut, stuffed around a hollowed pineapple filled with flavored stuffing, then roasted low and slow for a juicy, aromatic finish. Brining with cinnamon and brown sugar adds complexity, while the pineapple’s acidity cuts fat and keeps things moist. Cooking is done with foil protection and a cheesecloth to shield the tender pineapple crown from burning. Resting is essential to lock in juices. A rich pan sauce built from the drippings accompanies the slices. Ideal for group dinners, with a twist on classic fruit-stuffed poultry recipes."

ingredients:
- "2.25 kg turkey breast roast with skin, untrussed (about two half-breasts)"
- "=== BRINE ==="
- "1.25 liter cold water"
- "1.5 tbsp kosher salt"
- "1 tbsp dark brown sugar"
- "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "400 ml pineapple juice"
- "=== STUFFING ==="
- "100 ml dried cranberries"
- "150 ml boiling water"
- "1 medium shallot, finely chopped"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "1 tbsp butter"
- "45 ml chicken broth"
- "200 g mild Italian sausage meat (approx 2 sausages)"
- "100 ml toasted rustic bread cubes"
- "50 ml chopped roasted pistachios"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "1 fresh pineapple"
- "2 tbsp avocado oil"
- "Butcher's twine"
- "1 damp cotton cheesecloth (4 layers)"
- "Aluminum foil"
instructions:
- "=== BRINING ==="
- "Combine salt, brown sugar, cinnamon and 200 ml water in a small pot. Bring to a gentle boil, stirring until salt and sugar dissolve. Cool completely with 1 liter cold water and pineapple juice. Place turkey breast in a non-reactive container and submerge with brine. Refrigerate at least 20 hours (24 optimum). Don’t skip the brine; it balances dryness."
- "=== STUFFING ==="
- "Soak cranberries in boiling water for 7 minutes, drain well. Meanwhile, melt butter in skillet, sauté shallot and garlic until translucent and fragrant but not browned. Deglaze pan with chicken broth, reduce slightly. Combine sautéed aromatics, cranberries, sausage meat, bread cubes and pistachios in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper. The mix should hold shape but not be stiff; add broth for moisture if needed. Chill until ready."
- "=== PREPARE PINEAPPLE ==="
- "Peel pineapple leaving foliage intact. Using a long, sharp knife the length of pineapple, slice around core to preserve about 2.5 cm of flesh all around. Carefully slice beneath the core at base of crown to free it; expect slight splits and cracks. Fill hollow with most of the stuffing mix; if pineapple cracks, press gently back into shape and secure with toothpicks if stubborn. Keep remaining stuffing cold."
- "=== ASSEMBLE ROAST ==="
- "Preheat oven to 230°C (450°F) with rack in lowest third. Remove turkey from brine, rinse and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Lay skin-side down on work surface. Butterfly each half breast lengthwise to double surface area; a sharp knife and steady hand crucial here. Slip butcher’s twine under and between halves to create a flat rectangle, tuped ends of twine long for tying later. Season all over with salt and pepper. Spread remaining stuffing evenly over meat. Position stuffed pineapple in center, foliage end sticking out. Fold meat around pineapple and tie securely with twine in several places. The twine keeps stuffing and pineapple in place, making carving easier afterward."
- "Brush pineapple foliage lightly with avocado oil to prevent scorching."
- "Place roast on rack in roasting pan. Cover pineapple crown with damp cheesecloth to keep it moist. Then loosely tent with foil."
- "=== ROASTING ==="
- "Roast uncovered for 12 minutes until skin begins crisping and juices start running clear from edges. Reduce heat to 165°C (330°F). Re-cover if surface getting too brown. Continue roasting 2 to 2.5 hours, checking after 1 hour by inserting a meat thermometer in stuffing at pineapple core — target 73-74°C (163-165°F). If thermometer reading delayed, rely on juices running clear and firmness to touch: meat should spring back when pressed with finger. The foil tent may be removed last 15 min for extra browning if desired."
- "Remove from oven. Tent loosely with foil and rest at least 12 minutes before slicing. Rest locks juices; impatient carving equals dry meat every time."
- "=== TO SERVE ==="
- "Cut twine carefully, slice roast crosswise revealing layers of meat, stuffing, pineapple. Spoon pan juices over to moisten. Serve with bold sides — crystalline Parmesan potato rosettes work great. Leftovers reheat well wrapped in foil while retaining moisture."
- "=== NOTES & TIPS ==="
- "If pineapple crown carbonizes despite shielding, add extra layers of damp cheesecloth or tent foil early. Avoid opening oven too often—it causes drying. Use weight or fork to test pineapple softness; ready when tender but still holding shape."
- "Sausage meat could be replaced with ground chicken spiced with fennel and smoked paprika for a different dimension. Pistachios swap well for chopped toasted pecans or walnuts. Cranberries can be interchanged with currants or dried cherries for varied tartness."
- "If brine not possible, a dry rub of salt, sugar, cinnamon, and paprika rubbed under skin and on meat works, but expect juiciness loss."
introduction: "Starting out with turkey breast, the kind that’s unwieldy but promises juicy flesh if treated right. Brine first—big must for tender flesh. The cinnamon in brine tricks your nose, gives a subtle whisper of spice amid sweet pineapple juice. Cranberries recharge in hot water, plumping, tart and soft. Dicing pineapple just right, keeping that core intact is a puzzle; slice long with a slim knife and don't rush or the fruit splits more than it must. Stuffy fix? Sausage meets pistachio crunch, soaked bread for soft filler. Roasting’s a dance in heat—high heat start, to crackling skin, then low and slow so fibers relax, juice redistributes. Watch the color, feel the firmness; no thermometer? Press the roast gently—springy means done, floppy means raw inside. Resting after roast is non-negotiable; lets muscles relax and juices settle. Finish with sharp pan juice spooned on slices, a salty sweet nectar against the meaty earthiness. Tried this with pecans years ago, swapped out pine nuts for green pistachios, adds chew and a nutty pop unexpected. Don’t skip the cheesecloth wrap on pineapple tip—charred green leaves aren’t lovely. This farewell oven magic isn’t quick, but patience is your sous-chef. Work smart: prep squash or potatoes while rooster bakes; feed waiters and growl with smells penetrating house. Each pull from oven tells a story, steam rising, skin crackling. Slicing reveals hidden pineapple pocket—surprise tastes always appreciated at table."
ingredientsNote: "Ingredients tweaked for balance; downscaled turkey by 10% — household ovens vary, less mass speeds cook. Brine switched to kosher salt for better dissolve, brown sugar halved to blur not sweeten. Pineapple juice reduced slightly, to avoid watery brine but keep acidity fresh. Replaced onion with shallot—more subtle, avoids overpowering garlic, also cut 1 tbsp butter instead of 2 and used avocado oil instead of olive—more neutral flavor, higher smoke point protects pineapple greens later. Swapped Toulouse sausage for milder Italian variety—easier to find, less gamey but still flavorful. Bread cubes toasted for crunch, pistachios down 20%, better texture with evenly spread nuts. Cranberries reduced in volume, soaking longer for plumper fruit. Salt and pepper remain to season, but careful not to over-salt brine and stuffing because meat will uptake. Cheesecloth dampened; cotton absorbs some steam, keeps pineapple foliage fresh. Twine tied loosely but tight enough to hold stuffing and pineapple in. Foil tent essential to avoid brutal oven drying, especially on pineapple leaves. If fresh pineapple absent, canned can be used but naturally flavor loss and texture is softer. Fresh always preferred here—the core integrity critical. The brine step can be skipped, but expect less juicy breast; dry rub alternative with sugar and spices beneath skin is fallback."
instructionsNote: "Start by prepping brine well in advance—cinnamon MUST be gentle, no burning or bitter notes. Cool fully before submerging meat, else partial cooking starts and texture risks damage. All brining done in fridge, and use non-reactive containers (glass or stainless). While turkey brines, move to cranberries soaking—timing is precise here to avoid mush. Saute aromatics on medium heat, careful to not brown too much; burnt bits spoil filling flavor. Bread cubes toast separately for crunch, too wet stuffing causes soggy bird. Butterfly turkey with a sharp boning knife or chef's knife; open like a book. Skin must be down for stability, helps hold stuffing and pineapple in place. Twine under and over meat halves prevents shift in roast during cooking. Stuffing spread evenly, pineapple centered for even cooking, foliage sticks out for aesthetic but protected by cloth soak—wet cloth steams leaves, stops harsh drying and bitter charring. Roasting starts hot to brown skin fast, seals juices inside. Lower oven after 12 minutes to 165°C to avoid burning but maintain slow, even cooking. Insert thermometer in stuffing center near pineapple to measure doneness, but rely on combination with visual cues—juices clear, meat shrinks slightly from bone. Remove foil last 15 min if surface pale, else skin remains tender and moist. Rest is crucial—without it, juices run out on slicing, dry meat guaranteed. Use cooking drippings for jus—skim off excess fat, deglaze with a splash of broth or wine if needed, reduce to slightly thicken. Slice carefully, removing twine piece by piece to keep slices intact. Serve immediately. Leftovers store well wrapped, reheat gently covered in oven or steam pan to avoid drying. Inexperience may cause pineapple to break; bind gently with toothpicks to hold shape. Keep kitchen cool while prepping—the brining odors and roasted fruit scents can be intense and lingering."
tips:
- "Brining is a must to avoid dried out breast meat; cold water with kosher salt dissolves better, cinnamon needs gentle heat, no burning or bitter notes—cool fully before turkey goes in. Timing critical, 20 to 24 hours fridge. Skip or shorten brine and expect tougher flesh, dry bites."
- "When butterfly cutting, skin down holds meat stable, use sharp boning knife; steady hand to avoid shredding. Twine placement under and between halves creates neat rectangle for stuffing. Keep twine ends long for secure tying but don’t twist tight—stuffing needs room to stay moist not squished."
- "Watch roasting closely for color changes—start hot to crisp skin but reduce quickly to 165C. Tent foil if edges too brown mid-roast. Thermometer best in stuffing at pineapple core, 73 to 74°C. No thermometer? Press meat with finger; springy means done, floppy raw. Final 15 minutes foil off if wanting more brown crust."
- "Cheesecloth wrapped wet keeps pineapple crown from charring, critical for appearance and flavor—dry leaves turn bitter fast in oven heat. Add extra layers if char appears. Foil tent covers pineapple and slow cooks meat gently, preventing those brutal dry edges ovens wreak on large joints."
- "Stuffing balance matters; sausage for fat, pistachios for crunch, soaked bread soft filler. Cranberries rehydrated for acidity and tart pop. Use avocado oil on pineapple foliage, higher smoke point than olive oil; prevents leaf scorch. Butter sauté aromatics only till translucent, no browning to avoid bitter flavors."
faq:
- "q: Can I skip brining? a: Possible but expect drier meat. Brine hits tenderness and flavor depth. Dry rub alternative works but loses juiciness. Cooling brine before submerge avoids partial cooking. Short brine less effective—risks uneven seasoning."
- "q: What if pineapple breaks while prepping? a: Gently press back in place; toothpicks can hold stubborn cracks. Use sharp knife slicing lengthwise. Pineapple core intact crucial for stability and juice balance. If canned pineapple, softer texture, less core strength."
- "q: How to tell roast is done without thermometer? a: Press finger on meat edge; springy bounce means cooked through, floppy or jelly-like means raw inside. Juices clear runs from meat edges, not pink or blood-tinged. Meat shrinks slightly away from bone. Look for crisp skin start and subtle shrinking mid-roast."
- "q: How best to store leftovers? a: Wrap slices tightly in foil or airtight container. Refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat gently in oven wrapped again to keep moisture, or steam pan covered. Adding pan gravy back helps moistness. Avoid microwave unless wrapped, can dry quickly."
