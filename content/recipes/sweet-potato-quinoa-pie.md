- "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "FOR GARNISH"
- "1 large carrot sliced on bias thin"
- "1 leek white and pale green parts finely sliced"
- "1 1/2 cups broccolini blanched (sub broccoli rabe)"
- "1 1/2 cups Brussels sprouts leaves blanched, chopped"
- "1/3 cup toasted walnuts (instead of pecans, deeper flavor)"

- "1 tsp lemon juice"
instructions:
- "=== Pie ==="
- "Center oven rack before preheating to 205°C (400°F). Grease removable 23 cm (9 inch) tart pan well; olive oil or sunflower oil works fine."
- "Pierce raw sweet potato with fork multiple times; microwave 7-9 minutes turning halfway, watch skin blister and soft spot tested with fork. Let sit 5 minutes post cook. Scoop flesh and lightly mash with fork; need about 3/4 cup mashed sweet potato. Keep warm. Avoid wateriness, drain excess liquid if needed."
- "Pulse onion and garlic in food processor until finely minced but not pureed, retains texture. Add mashed sweet potato to processor and blend until combined but still coarse. Transfer to mixing bowl."
- "Add dry quinoa, flour, cinnamon, allspice and smoked paprika; salt and pepper generously. These spices replace cayenne with smoky warmth, less bite. Mix well. The flour binds moisture and quinoa cooks fully in oven. No eggs needed here."
- "Spread mixture evenly in tart pan, dampen fingers and smooth top firmly. Oil surface all over with pastry brush to promote browning and prevent crust dryness."
- "Bake in oven for 35-40 minutes till golden brown with slightly firm springy touch; edges should caramelize slightly and crust lifts cleanly from pan sides. Don’t open oven repeatedly, watch color through window."
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "Meanwhile heat 1 tbsp olive oil in large non-stick skillet over medium. Add carrot and leek, cover, stir occasionally for 4-5 minutes until softened but still with some snap. Add broccolini and Brussels sprouts leaves, warm 2-3 minutes. Salt and pepper well, toss in walnut pieces and lemon juice last two minutes to preserve zing and crunch."
- "=== Yogurt sauce ==="
- "Mix Greek yogurt with chopped fresh herbs and lemon juice in small bowl, season with salt and pepper. Herbs add brightness and a touch of anise flavor from tarragon. Refrigerate until ready."
- "Remove pie carefully from pan onto serving plate; the crust should hold firmly solid but soft enough for slicing. Spread yogurt sauce on top; pile vegetable garnish generously."
- "Serve semi-warm or room temp. Leftovers reheat well in oven to restore crust crispness."
- "=== Notes ==="
- "Use cooked quinoa if pressed for time; reduce oven to 180°C (350°F) and watch crust drying closely."
- "If no food processor, finely mince onion and garlic by hand and mix thoroughly. Texture slightly different but flavor intact."
- "Replace walnuts with toasted hazelnuts or almonds if preferred; pecans omitted for deeper flavor contrast."
- "If sweet potato too wet: bake longer unpeeled to dry flesh, or mash and drain excess moisture on paper towel before mixing."
- "Flour essential to bind, but whole wheat or spelt add nuttiness and fiber."
- "For vegan tweak: swap Greek yogurt with coconut yogurt or cashew-based spread; add a splash of apple cider vinegar for sharpness."
introduction: "Sweet potato base offers natural sweetness and moisture. Quinoa lends chew, protein, subtle nuttiness. Tried heavy egg binders; always felt stiff, dense. Leaving them out, relying on flour and starch from sweet potato helps crust stay tender but firm enough. Smoky paprika swapped for cayenne; less fire but deep flavor. Roasted walnuts give satisfying crunch and a bitter edge to counter sweetness. Leek and carrot softened just until tender, still some bite remains. Yogurt sauce with tarragon herbs cuts richness, adds tangy lift. Familiar flavors, but layered and unexpected with textured crust and fresh vegetable contrast. Not your run-of-the-mill veggie pie. Try to avoid sogginess mid-pie — drain or bake sweet potato carefully, watch crust browning closely."
ingredientsNote: "Quantities adjusted for 10 servings; sweet potato mashed quantity crucial — too wet sabotages crust. Whole wheat flour used for more robust flavor and fiber, spelt workable substitute. Smoked paprika replaces cayenne to control heat but preserve warmth. Walnuts replace pecans for deeper roasted aroma and sharper crunch. Broccolini in place of broccoli is tender, slightly sweet, with thinner stalks so they heat more evenly. Herb mix tarragon forward adds anise notes; parsley and chives add freshness. Juice of lemon added both to veggies and yogurt sauce for brightness and to prevent oxidization and dullness. Use olive oil for combo of flavor and moisture retention; avoid butter which can make dough greasy and dense. Fresh herbs chopped finely for even integration in cool yogurt dip. No eggs needed — relies on flour and sweet potato starch."
instructionsNote: "Starting from center rack lets crust bake evenly. Poking sweet potato to soften is faster than baking whole; watch carefully so not to steam soggy. Mashing coarse keeps bite and texture evident in filling. Food processor pulses onion and garlic quickly release flavor without puree stage. Using fingers wet with water smooths out topping but prevents sticking, makes crust tidy. Oil brush on surface before baking helps Maillard browning, gives lightly shiny crust finish. Timing ranges are approximate; watch for visual cues — golden color, firm resilience to touch. Vegetables cooked just long enough to soften but still retain snap and texture contrast. Lemon juice added last to maintain brightness and crisp texture. Fresh herbs mixed last in yogurt sauce preserve color, flavor. Spoon yogurt over pie after baking, preventing sauce from curdling and soaking into crust prematurely. Allow tart to cool 5 minutes before slicing to set structure, easier cutting."
tips:
- "Poke sweet potato several times before microwaving; skin blistered signals softness; mash coarse never puree, keeps bite. Drain any excess water before mixing. Moisture ruins crust set. Keep mashed potato warm, easier to blend with dry stuff. Flour choice matters whole wheat or spelt bind starchy fibres, give more structure. Unexpected but crucial is oil brushed on surface before baking prevents crust drying, boosts browning too. Watch crust edges for caramel color; first sign crust lifts clean is post-bake readiness."
- "Pulse onion and garlic in bursts; too fine pureed changes texture and flavor release. Onion still contains fibrous bits, adds subtle crunch under creamy sweet potato. Add spices last to pulse mix; smoked paprika replaces cayenne for mild warmth, no burn but deep tone. Mix quinoa dry, flour and spices thoroughly so crust cooks through evenly. Salt well; undersalting means flat in center. Use damp fingers to smooth crust top; wetness prevents sticking but don’t soak dough, just light damp. No eggs, rely on sweet potato starch and flour combo for binding."
- "Sauté carrot and leek on medium covered pan; soften but keep slight snap; timing critical 4-5 mins max before veggies fade out. Add broccolini and Brussels leaves last; quick toss 2-3 mins warm only, preserve texture and freshness. Salt early, pepper later; lemon juice last two minutes to avoid bitterness but add brightness. Toasted walnuts instead pecans bring roast crunch and slight bitterness contrast. Alternative nuts swap easy hazelnuts or almonds work fine but pecans excluded here for sharper edge."
- "Yogurt sauce—combine Greek yogurt with fresh herbs chopped fine; tarragon strong anise note sharpens flavors, parsley and chives add freshness. Lemon juice adds tangy lift but mix last so sauce doesn’t weep. Keep cold, add salt and pepper just before serving to preserve brightness. Spoon yogurt on pie only after cooling 5 mins, stops sauce breaking curdling or soaking into crust prematurely. Keeps crust crisp, sauce fresh."
- "Baking: center rack for even heat, 205°C or 400°F good range. Avoid opening oven repeatedly; watch through window for golden edges, slight caramelization. Crust should lift clean off pan sides, springy to touch means done but not dry. If using cooked quinoa shortcut reduce oven heat to 180°C, watch crust drying. Too wet sweet potato: bake longer unpeeled or drain on paper towel. Texture changes if food processor not used—hand chopped onion and garlic work but less uniform. Sub dairy yogurt with coconut or cashew for vegan; add splash apple cider vinegar for acidity."
faq:
- "q: Why no eggs here? a: Flour and sweet potato starch bind. Eggs stiffen, make crust dense from past tests. Coarse mash holds texture better. No need for extra moisture. Adds chew and structure instead of heaviness."
- "q: Can I use regular broccoli? a: Broccolini preferred for tenderness, thinner stalks heat evenly. Broccoli rabe also substitute but bit bitter. Timing same, but watch cooking steps to keep texture crisp, not wilted."
- "q: What if crust soggy? a: Excess moisture culprit usually. Drain sweet potato mash well. Brush oil before baking to keep surface dry. Bake longer uncovered if needed. Avoid opening oven too often or weak crust forms."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Wrap pie well, fridge up to 3 days. Reheat oven preferred to keep crust crisp; microwave makes crust soggy. Sauce can be stored separate to keep fresh, add after warming."
