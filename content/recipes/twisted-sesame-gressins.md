title: "Twisted Sesame Gressins"
slug: "twisted-sesame-gressins"
description: "Thin crunchy sticks made from a simple dough of flour, oil, and yeast. Baked until golden with a coating of black sesame and flax seeds. Vegan, nut-free, egg-free, dairy-free. Preparation involves mixing, resting, rolling into long threads, and baking. Yields about two dozen sticks. Fermentation extended slightly, dough enriched with olive and walnut oils for flavor contrast. Baking temperature higher by 10 degrees for a crisp finish. The slight twist in seeds and oil choice modifies texture and taste without complicating steps."

ingredients:
- "260 g (1 3/4 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "6 ml (1 1/4 tsp) granulated sugar"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) instant yeast"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) salt"
- "160 ml (2/3 cup) warm water"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil plus some for brushing"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) walnut oil"
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) black sesame seeds and flaxseed mix (optional)"
instructions:
- "Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a big bowl or mixer bowl with dough hook."
- "Add warm water and both oils gradually, stir to form rough dough ball."
- "Knead 6 to 7 minutes on floured surface until smooth or in mixer until supple."
- "Shape dough into ball, place in lightly oiled bowl, cover with damp cloth."
- "Let rest in warm humid spot for 2 to 2 1/2 hours until doubled."
- "Preheat oven to 210°C (410°F), position rack in center."
- "Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, brush parchment lightly with oil."
- "Dust dough with flour, turn out onto surface."
- "Roll dough out to roughly 26 x 11 cm rectangle (10 x 4.5 inches)."
- "Cut into thin strips about 1 cm wide with pizza cutter or sharp knife."
- "Roll each strip into tight 30 cm (12 inch) long rods on the counter."
- "Arrange 12 sticks per sheet, brush with oil, sprinkle with seed blend."
- "Roll sticks gently to stick seeds well."
- "Bake one sheet at a time for 14 minutes or until sticks are golden and crisp."
- "Cool on wire rack completely before storing in airtight container."
- "Keep at room temperature for up to 1 week."
introduction: "Sticks you bite. Crunchy, dry, olive oil whispers. Yeast wakes the flour, dough stretches, sleeps long, not too long. Seeds add crunch, not just looks. Black sesame and flax create contrast – nuttier, earthier. Two oils for a subtle background. Kneading hands get tired but shapes rise. Oven heats hotter than usual for a sharper crust. Rolls that snap too quick. No eggs, no dairy, nothing extra. Just texture. Store in a jar or plastic box. Gone fast. Simple snacks, small bites. Almost bread. Almost cracker. They sit between hunger and waiting, in between meals or with soup."
ingredientsNote: "Use unbleached flour, its stronger gluten develops chewiness and structure needed for long thin sticks. Sugar feeds yeast, helps rise without sweetness. Two types of oil – olive oil for flavor, walnut oil for richer aroma and subtle nuttiness. Walnut oil low smoke point but okay for dough only, not frying. Seeds: black sesame for color and earthiness, flaxseed for slight crunch and omega benefits. Adjust seed quantity or skip if allergic. Water temperature crucial – warm but not hot to activate yeast without killing it. Salt balances flavor and controls yeast activity. Measurements altered to keep hydration about 60%, a workable sticky dough but not too wet or dry."
instructionsNote: "Mix dry ingredients first to distribute yeast evenly. Add water and oils slowly, ensures no clumps. Knead well to develop gluten, dough takes shape and elasticity. Rest time extended from usual to 2–2.5 hours, dough gets more flavor and rises fully. Preparation surface dusted lightly, dough rolled gently to avoid tearing but thin enough to crisp. Cuts precise and uniform; inconsistent strips bake unevenly. Rolling strips creates a tighter crumb and crunch. Brush oil on parchment to prevent sticks sticking and promote even bottom baking. Seed mix applied as last step before baking, pressed in to avoid falling off. Hotter oven by 10 degrees speeds crust formation, shorter baking reduces dryness or burning. Cool fully on rack avoids sogginess from steam condensation. Store airtight to maintain brittle texture."
tips:
- "Mix dry ingredients first always. Gets yeast spread evenly. Add water and oils slowly, avoid clumps. Dough sticky but workable. Knead 6-7 minutes, builds gluten. Rest dough 2-2 1/2 hours, longer rest for flavor, better rise."
- "Oil for flavor and texture. Olive oil fruity, walnut oil richer aroma, subtle nuttiness. Walnut oil cooks badly hot, ok in dough only. Brush baking sheet lightly with oil, stops sticks from sticking, helps even bake on bottom."
- "Cut uniform strips about 1 cm wide. Inconsistent size means uneven baking. Roll strips gently long and tight, around 30 cm. Keeps crumb tighter, crunchier sticks. Dust surface with flour lightly, avoid tearing dough when rolling."
- "Oven temperature hotter than usual by 10 degrees, 210°C or 410°F. Speeds crust forming, crunch develops faster. Bake one tray at a time for even heat. Watch sticks closely to avoid burning or drying out."
- "Seeds pressed on last step. Mix black sesame and flax for earthiness plus crunch. Seeds add more than looks, give texture. Can adjust quantity or skip. Cool fully on wire rack to keep crunch, avoid soggy spots from steam."
faq:
- "q: How warm should water be? a: Warm not hot. Around 38-40°C is good. Too hot kills yeast, cold slows rise. Water activates yeast, starts fermentation. Just warm enough makes dough rise properly but not kill yeast cells."
- "q: Can oils be substituted? a: Yes but affects flavor. Olive oil fruity, walnut oil nutty richness. Swap walnut for more olive or mild oil but lose aroma layers. No deep frying, walnut oil has low smoke point, only use in dough mix."
- "q: Dough too sticky or dry? a: Sticky can mean too much water or insufficient kneading. Dust surface with flour to handle. Dry means less water or overkneading. Hydration about 60% aim. Adjust flour or water gradually, not all at once."
- "q: How to store gressins? a: Airtight container best but glass or plastic works. Keep at room temp, avoid humidity or fridge—makes sticks soft. Last about a week if dry and sealed. Re-crisp in oven if softened but watch time, easy burn."
