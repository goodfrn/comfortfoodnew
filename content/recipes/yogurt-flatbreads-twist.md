description: "Flatbreads made without yeast using yogurt and baking powder for lift. Subtle tang from yogurt, soft crumb, slight chew. Simple combo of flour, water, olive oil, and honey instead of sugar. Dough rests to develop texture, cooked on hot grill for char and puff. Quick mix and knead, no fuss rising. Good for impromptu gatherings or quick wraps. Versatile, handles fillings well. Skip yeast problems, no waiting to rise. Bake the same on skillet or oven with minor tweaks."

ingredients:
- "280 g (just under 2 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) honey instead of sugar"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) salt"
- "125 ml (1/2 cup) plain 2% yogurt"
- "90 ml (6 tbsp) warm water"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) olive oil"
- "4 g (1 tsp) baking powder replaces yeast"
instructions:
- "Start by combining flour, honey, salt, and baking powder in a big bowl. Make a well in the center; add yogurt, warm water, and olive oil. Use a fork to draw flour in slowly till dough just comes together. Sticky, shaggy but manageable."
- "Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead by hand around 6 minutes — more than usual. Feel the elasticity developing under your fingers. Smooth, supple dough is the goal, not tough. Use little extra flour if too sticky but don’t dry it out."
- "Cover dough with a clean towel. Let rest 45 minutes. No yeast, but resting relaxes gluten, helps aerate a bit."
- "Divide dough into 8 equal balls. Shape pebbles, smooth tops with hands. Let them sit uncovered for 12 minutes. You’ll see tiny bubbles on surface—good sign dough is waking up."
- "Preheat grill or hot cast-iron pan. Brush grate or pan lightly with olive oil. Important for sticking issues."
- "Roll each ball into 15 cm (6 inch) discs. Dust lightly with flour to keep from sticking. Thickness should be even - about 3 mm - not paper-thin. Too thin, they dry too fast."
- "Cook 4 flatbreads at a time on grill or pan. Close lid if available. After 2 minutes, watch for puffing - bubbles or small blisters forming. When puffed up, flip carefully with tongs or spatula."
- "Cook another 1 to 2 minutes on second side. Should have golden-brown spots, slight char, soft interior. Overcooked = tough, undercooked = gummy."
- "Stack flatbreads on plate, cover with clean kitchen towel. Holding moisture and warmth preserves softness."
- "Serve warm. Great for wraps or dipping into hummus, tzatziki, or veggie stews."
introduction: "Yogurt flatbreads without yeast? Yep. Tried many times over years — saves waiting, no yeast hassles, and tang from yogurt gives bite. Baking powder swaps in for leavening; be mindful not to overdo it or flatbreads get weird taste. They puff nicely on a hot grill or skillet, blister, and brown with those little black spots. Perfect texture when dough is rested properly and kneaded enough to get spring in crumb but not rubbery. Honey took over sugar role here — subtle sweetness, deeper, not just plain sweet. If kitchen’s cold, count on longer dough rest. I skip resting longer than an hour; drying starts. These flatbreads hold up to fillings or dips well — soft but sturdy. Hands-on dough, watch and feel changes, don’t rely too much on clocks. Visual cues matter — dough surface, bubble forming, golden patches on bread. No yeast, no proofing, but still magic in the heat and patience."
ingredientsNote: "Switching sugar for honey changes flavor profile — honey adds a floral touch and browns better during cooking. Baking powder replaces yeast, so dough doesn’t rise much but puffs under heat. Crucial to measure it carefully—too much, bitter aftertaste. Flour choice matters—unbleached all-purpose or even bread flour for bite. Grayish spots in dough? That’s from oil or honey clustering—not a problem. Keep water warm, not hot; too hot kills yogurt’s softness character. Olive oil is non-negotiable for texture and smell, but neutral oils like canola work in pinch. If no plain yogurt, Greek style thicker yogurt can be thinned with a bit of water. Salt is key to balance flavors — don’t skimp. Flour dust helps prevent sticking but less is better otherwise bread gets dry patches during rolling. Dough texture on kneading should be tacky but not sticky enough to cling to hands — slight stickiness disappears after rest, shows good hydration."
instructionsNote: "Mixing with fork before kneading helps bring flour in evenly without overworking. Knead thoroughly—this builds gluten despite no yeast. Resting dough lets moisture absorb fully; underrested dough tears during rolling. Cut into equal portions for uniform cooking times. The 10-minute rest after shaping lets dough relax, so rolling easier — skipping this means flatbreads snap back or stay thick. Hot grill or pan essential. If grill hot enough, dough puffs quickly and chars; too cool, flatbreads go tough. Watch for bubbles or blisters — best indication to flip. Don’t flip too often or press bread down, prevents puffing. Covering stacked flatbreads after cooking traps steam, keeps them pliable but don’t cover hot griddle directly—moisture build-up ruins crust. If you can’t grill, cast-iron pan or skillet mimics results, preheated properly. Cooking time flexible by heat; listening for sizzle, sight of bubbles, feel bread pliability more reliable than timer. These are hands-on breads—pay attention to smells (yeasty aroma even without yeast, thanks yogurt) and signs of doneness by eye and touch."
tips:
- "Knead dough longer than usual, about 6 minutes or more. Dough feels tacky, not sticky. Watch hand resistance—too little kneading, dough tears; too much, gets tough. Resting helps soften tackiness. Use extra flour sparingly to prevent drying out. Texture matters more than time."
- "Rest dough under towel for 45 mins minimum. Doesn’t rise much but gluten relaxes. If cold kitchen, add time but watch drying. Over-resting—more than 1 hour—start drying crust. Sticky surface after rest? Normal. Visualize bubbles forming later on dough balls."
- "Roll discs to about 3 mm thickness. Too thin, bread dries fast; too thick, dough stays dense. Flour dusting okay, but keep light or patches appear. Thickness uniformity impacts puffing and blistering. Watch edges puff before flipping; signals ready."
- "Cook on very hot grill or cast-iron pan. Sizzle sounds and aroma changes help timing. Bubbles and blisters pop up 2 minutes in usually. Flip when top fully puffed but not bursting. After flipping, 1-2 minutes for golden patches, slight char. No press down, keeps puff intact."
- "Honey replaces sugar adding browning and subtle sweet & floral notes. Baking powder must be measured right; too much bitter. Yogurt choice affects softness—plain 2% or thin Greek style. Olive oil crucial for dough elasticity and grilling; canola optional but less flavor."
faq:
- "q: Why rest dough if no yeast? a: Gluten needs relaxing. Rest doesn’t rise much but lets moisture absorb. Makes dough easier to shape. Underrested dough tears and snaps back when rolled. Resting also helps bubbles appear when cooking, adding texture."
- "q: Can I use other sweeteners? a: Honey brings floral browning, unique flavor. Maple syrup or agave possible but affects color and texture. Sugar works but less depth. Adjust water slightly if substituting thick syrups. Keep sweetener small quantity or bitterness from baking powder more obvious."
- "q: What if dough is too sticky? a: Add flour bit by bit but sparingly. Sticky dough improves after resting. Over-flouring leads dry flatbreads with patches. Knead longer for gluten development. Warm water helps hydration balance. Sticky dough is better than dry, but manage tackiness."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Stack and wrap in clean towel then plastic or airtight container. Refrigerate up to 2 days. Reheat on hot pan or grill for best texture. Avoid microwave unless covered, can toughen or make gummy. Freeze separated by wax paper for longer storage."
