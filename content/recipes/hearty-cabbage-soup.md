slug: "hearty-cabbage-soup"
description: "Ground beef browned till no pink remains. Onions and carrots softened with garlic paste. Seasoned with Worcestershire, paprika, Italian herbs, and more. Cabbage wilts a bit before adding broth, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, ketchup, bay leaves, and rice. Simmer mostly covered so the rice cooks through evenly, peeking only at the end. Remove bay leaves. Garnish fresh parsley. Around 50 minutes start to finish. Robust savory base with subtle tang from ketchup. Filling, warming, simple layering of flavors and textures not fussy but satisfying."

ingredients:
- "1 pound ground beef"
- "1 medium onion chopped"
- "2 medium carrots diced"
- "1 tablespoon garlic paste or minced garlic"
- "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper ground fresh if possible"
- "1 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 teaspoon onion powder"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika sub sweet paprika if unavailable"
- "1 teaspoon Italian seasoning dried"
- "1 small head green cabbage shredded"
- "4 cups beef broth"
- "1 can (14.5 ounces) petite diced tomatoes unseasoned works best"
- "1 can (8 ounces) tomato sauce"
- "2 tablespoons ketchup add a little more if you want tang pop"
- "2 bay leaves fresh or dried"
- "1/2 cup uncooked long grain white rice rinse under cold water"
- "Fresh parsley chopped to garnish"
instructions:
- "Brown ground beef in a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat. No pink, breaking it apart well. Drain off excess fat or use slotted spoon and discard grease; beef back in pot."
- "Add chopped onions, diced carrots, and garlic paste. Sauté until onions turn translucent and carrots start to soften, about 6-8 minutes. Stir often. Aromas will fill kitchen."
- "Sprinkle in Worcestershire, salt, freshly ground black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and Italian seasoning. Mix thoroughly to coat meat-veggie base. This layering builds depth."
- "Add shredded cabbage right to pot. Stir, let soften slightly—about 3 minutes. You want wilted but still with bite; cabbage releases water, so keep an eye for moisture."
- "Pour beef broth, diced tomatoes including juices, tomato sauce, and ketchup straight into pot. Toss in bay leaves and stir gently."
- "Rinse rice until water runs clear; draining excess starch keeps soup from clouding. Mix rice into soup uniformly. Give one last stir to combine everything."
- "Bring pot to a full rolling boil uncovered, then reduce heat to low. Cover tightly; simmer gently for about 30 minutes. Avoid lifting lid—rice needs steam to cook evenly."
- "After 30 minutes, remove lid cautiously and check rice texture. Should be tender but not mushy. If still firm, cover back up and cook an extra 5-7 minutes. Texture is key; no crunch allowed here."
- "Discard bay leaves before serving. Ladle hot soup in bowls. Sprinkle with fresh parsley for brightness and subtle herb aroma that cuts through richness."
- "Serve immediately. Leftovers improve flavor the next day but add fresh parsley again upon reheating."
introduction: "Ground beef bubbling in the pot, onions sweetening, and carrot edges caramelizing. Savory aromas pulse through the kitchen, that heady mix of garlic and paprika strikes first. Throwing cabbage in early softens it just enough for the broth to coat each leaf, but still with body. The rice cooks in the simmering juices, swelling into tender clouds beneath the rich tomato base, ketchup lending a sharp zing. Bay leaves deepen the flavor subtly. Noise of gentle bubbling under the lid signals the magic, don’t peek too soon. When the lid finally lifts, steam and scent rise—this is not just soup; it’s an all-in-one meal. Comes together pretty fast once you know the rhythm of timing and textures. Lessons learned—don’t rush the simmer, and rinse your rice."
ingredientsNote: "Ground beef binds the whole dish with meaty heft; extra lean works but adds dryness—don’t skip the fat drain or soup gets greasy. Onions and carrots balance sweetness with some earthy texture, garlic paste preferable for even distribution of flavor but minced fresh is fine. Worcestershire sauce punches in umami; soy sauce can approximate if missing. Smoked paprika imparts a subtle smoky warmth; regular paprika good backup but lose some depth. Italian seasoning provides herbaceous notes; dried oregano and basil if you have no mix. Shredded cabbage releases liquid that softens texture but don’t overcook or it’s mush. Beef broth should be low sodium or risk an overly salty soup because ketchup and canned tomatoes contribute salt too. Petite diced tomatoes preferred for uniform size, diced fresh tomatoes can work but may lengthen simmer time. Tomato sauce adds body; ketchup is twist for tang and slight sweetness—don’t skip. Bay leaves give a background earthiness but remove before eating! Rinse rice carefully to avoid cloudy starchy broth; long grain white rice cooks in 30-35 minutes submerged in broth perfectly. Parsley adds a fresh herbal brightness needed to cut richness and round off tangy corners. Substitute ground turkey or pork for beef if preferred but fat content adjustments warranted."
instructionsNote: "Start with browning beef well—this seals in flavor and adds Maillard notes; don’t rush or crowd pan or meat steams. Drain fat thoroughly; greasy soup is mostly disappointment. Softening onions and carrots with garlic until translucent builds foundational sweetness and aroma; stirring pastes in distributes flavor bits uniformly. Seasoning meat and veggies before adding liquids ensures spice hits all depths. Toss cabbage in last before liquids so it wilts gently rather than stews into sludge—tactile test is slight give but still a crisp snap when bitten. Adding broth and canned tomato elements creates complex tang and body; ketchup adds unexpected zing to accent. Bay leaves steep in background, must remove or taste turns odd and bitter. Rinse rice before dropping into soup to prevent gummy results; even distribution keeps cooking even. Bring to rolling boil uncovered to activate starches, then reduce and cover to trap steam. Resist temptation to peek; rice needs steady moist heat and lifting lid releases it. Use spoon to gauge rice softness near end—should be plump, tender but intact. Leftovers thicken; reheat gently with more broth if needed. Garnishing with parsley brightens aroma and color, making servings visually inviting."
tips:
- "Brown ground beef thoroughly; key to texture. Avoid crowding pan or meat steams instead of caramelizes. Drain fat well; too much leaves greasy mouthfeel. Use slotted spoon to remove if needed. Layering spices after veggies soften locks in flavors. Keep stirring to avoid burning paprika or garlic powder."
- "Add cabbage last before liquids. It needs just a couple minutes to soften but not turn to mush. Watch water release; too much dilutes broth. Cabbage texture should have some bite, not limp or slimy. Stir gently but quickly; prolonged stirring breaks leaves apart."
- "Rinse rice under cold water until clear; removes surface starch. Prevents cloudy, gummy broth. Rice cooks fully submerged. If broth is low, add a splash of water or broth to avoid sticking. Longer grain white rice best choice; brown rice needs different cook time and more liquid."
- "Simmer covered to trap steam. Don't lift lid repeatedly; heat escapes, rice cooks unevenly. Sounds change when simmering properly—gentle bubbling without roaring boil. Near end, listen for softer bubbling and less aggressive foam. Check rice last 5 minutes, add time if firm. Texture crucial."
- "Bay leaves add earthiness but must remove before serving; flavor turns bitter otherwise. Fresh parsley brightens aroma just before serving and on leftovers reheat. Tomato sauce and ketchup bring body and subtle sweet-tang complexity; don't skip ketchup unless no alternatives. Worcestershire sauce can be swapped with soy sauce for umami."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap ground beef? a: Sure. Ground turkey or pork work but expect different fat content. Lean turkey dries out easier, so watch cooking times. Pork adds richness. Adjust salt and fat drains accordingly."
- "q: How to prevent mushy cabbage? a: Add cabbage late, 2 to 3 mins max before liquids. Keep it crisp-tender. Watch wilt signs not overcooked. Overstirring breaks leaves down. Don’t leave cabbage too long in hot broth off heat."
- "q: Rice still firm after suggested simmer? a: Cover pot tightly, simmer low heat. If rice hard, add small amount hot broth and continue cooking few mins. Avoid stirring hard once simmering. Check with spoon near end, be patient."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, refrigerate in airtight container up to 3 days. Soup thickens; add broth or water when reheating. Freezing works, but texture changes slightly. Add parsley fresh at serving for brightness."
