ingredients:
- "470 g (about 1 lb) parsnips peeled and cut into chunks"
- "3 medium onions roughly chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves whole, unpeeled"
- "1 small white leek sliced into 1-cm rings"
- "1 Pink Lady apple unpeeled cored and diced"
- "50 ml (3.5 tbsp) olive oil plus extra for drizzling"
- "1.2 litres (5 cups) warm chicken or vegetable stock"
- "2 slices country style bread"
- "80 g (3/4 cup) sharp aged cheddar grated"
- "2 tbsp chopped fresh chives"
- "1 tsp ground cumin (replaces black pepper twist)"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 210°C (410°F). Rack in middle position. Use parchment or nonstick tray."
- "Toss parsnips, onions, leek rings, and apple with 3 tbsp olive oil, salt, and 1 tsp ground cumin. Spread evenly so veggies roast not steam."
- "Add unpeeled garlic cloves on tray edges for gentle roasting. Roast 40 to 50 minutes until golden brown edges and fragrant. Watch carefully after 40 min; browned spots, slightly shriveled edges, tender inside tell doneness."
- "Remove garlic cloves; squeeze softened garlic pulp out, discard skins."
- "Transfer roasted veggies and garlic pulp to blender. Add warm stock gradually. Pulse until very smooth and creamy without lumps. Taste and adjust salt and cumin if needed. Soup texture thicker than pure water, lean toward velvety consistency."
- "Wipe or lightly oil same baking tray. Lay bread slices, sprinkle cheese generously. Bake 5 to 7 minutes until cheese bubbles and toasty brown spots appear."
- "Cut cheesy toasts into cubes."
- "Serve hot soup in bowls, drizzle with olive oil, top with croûtons, scatter chives."
- "Enjoy rich roasted aroma, contrast creamy soup, crispy cheesy bites. Talk about layers of flavor from humble roots."
introduction: "Roasting changes everything. Parsnips become caramel sweetness, onions develop rich karamell. Garlic softens, leeks add slight onion twist but subtler. Apple? Bright acid, subtle fruitiness cutting heaviness. This one’s about coaxing hidden flavor. Skipped cream on purpose; satisfy with roasted depth and cheese topping. I pick Pink Lady over Cortland—sharper bite, cleaner finish. Cumin sneaks in warmth, less obvious spice than black pepper, holds its ground during roasting. This soup isn’t fancy. It’s kitchen wisdom distilled, good for quiet dinner nights when you want more than plain broth. Texture creamy but not gummy, topped with crunchy toasts that melt cheddar. You hear the crackle, smell the roasting—the real deal."
ingredientsNote: "Parsnips—peel only if skin is dirty or thick. If really fresh, the skin is thin and adds earthiness. Substitute with carrots if out of luck, though sweetness shifts. Onions must brown well; yellow or sweet onions work better here than red, which can be too sharp raw. Leek adds background texture—clean thoroughly. Apple choice matters: Pink Lady or Granny Smith for tartness, Cortland is softer so less pungent in soup. Olive oil is key; don’t skimp. For broth, chicken gives warmth, but veg stock supports vegan needs. Cheese? Sharp aged cheddar is non-negotiable to counter the sweet layers. Bread: rustic country loaf, no sandwich bread. Stale bread for toasts holds up better, absorbs cheese without soggy mess. Cumin replaces typical pepper—try it for depth. Optional garnishes like thyme or sage if feeling adventurous."
instructionsNote: "Oven temp high but don’t burn veggies—watch closely last 10 minutes. Visual cues trump times. If veggies shrivel nicely with charred bits, you’re set. Garlic needs softening, not burning—check after 35-40 minutes. Extract pulp by pressing while warm. Avoid blending cold stock or cold veggies; temperature helps emulsify textures. Blend in batches if large quantity. Salt after blending, never before roasting—salt draws water, preventing browning. Crisp croûtons on same tray save time and flavor boost but check so cheese doesn't burn—5 minutes minimum, up to 7 max depending on oven. Cut while hot for best texture. Drizzling olive oil over soup right before serving adds silkiness and aroma—don’t skip. Fresh chives add color and slight onion zing. Avoid overblending or soup turns gluey; pulse slowly."
tips:
- "Roast parsnips and onions until chestnut-brown edges appear. Not burnt, hints of caramel. Watch last 10 minutes intensely. Shriveling edges mean good roasting. Garlic whole cloves soften gently if placed on tray edges, check around 40 min. Pungency mellows here."
- "Salt only after blending. Salt draws moisture, stops browning raw. Wait till veggies fully roasted. Blend warm stock gradually with roasted veggies. Cold stock ruins creamy texture, makes soup gluey. Pulse blend - avoid overmixing. Texture should feel velvety, not gummy or watery."
- "Use Pink Lady apple for bright acid bite. Cortland softer, less pungent in soup. If out of apples, replace with a tart pear for complexity or Granny Smith for sharpness. Leeks add subtle onion texture but clean thoroughly. Dirt hides in layers, no shortcuts here."
- "Cheddar crostini on stale rustic country bread. Sandwich bread soggy, ruins crunch. Sprinkle cheese liberally, bake on tray with light oil wipe. 5-7 minutes oven time hot enough to bubble cheese in spots. Cut while hot into cubes so cheese cracks, prevents sogginess."
- "Cumin replaces standard pepper for warm undertone. Adds twist but mild, holding aroma under roasting heat. Can experiment with smoked paprika or coriander seeds ground fresh instead. Olive oil drizzle on soup just before serving adds silkiness and aroma, never skip this final step."
faq:
- "q: Can I use veggie stock instead of chicken? a: Yes, definitely. Veg stock works well. Flavor shifts mild but keeps warm base. Use homemade or good quality. Chicken stock gives richer note, but veg holds here fine."
- "q: How to know when parsnips and onions are done roasting? a: Look for golden brown edges, chestnut color, slight shriveling on surface. Smell garlic aroma softening. Touch veggies for tender bite without collapse. If burnt dark spots, scrap them off or reduce time next round."
- "q: My soup turned gluey. What went wrong? a: Usually overblending or adding cold stock. Blend in short pulses. Warm stock essential. Also salt after blending not before roasting because salt traps moisture, preventing roast caramelization. Try again with these tweaks."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly. Keeps 3-4 days in fridge in airtight. Reheat gently, add splash warm stock or water if too thick. Freezing works but texture may weaken slightly. Thaw overnight in fridge, stir well before warming."
