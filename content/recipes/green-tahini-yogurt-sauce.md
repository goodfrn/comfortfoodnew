ingredients:
- "12 g (1/3 cup) flat-leaf parsley, chopped"
- "12 g (1/3 cup) fresh mint leaves, chopped"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) tahini"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) lemon juice"
- "1 small clove garlic, minced"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) plain Greek yogurt"
- "90 ml (3/8 cup) plain Greek yogurt"
- "Salt to taste"
instructions:
- "Place parsley, mint, olive oil, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic into a small food processor or blender."
- "Add half the Greek yogurt, about 180 ml, to the mixture."
- "Pulse until mixture is well combined but still has some texture, around 7 to 8 minutes blending intermittently."
- "Transfer blended mix into a bowl."
- "Gently fold in the remaining yogurt until fully incorporated."
- "Season with salt generously, stir to combine."
- "Let sit for 5 minutes to let flavors meld before serving."
introduction: "Herbs and cream. Quick mix. Parsley changed to mint for fresh zing. Lemon juice upped slightly. Yogurt divided, blended half first then folded in. No fuss. Chopped garlic only just to lift. Olive oil smooths edges. Whizz for about 7 minutes, no more. All fresh. Simple. Served cold. Use as dip, spread, or drizzle. Great with roasted veggies or grilled bread. Also good for smoky dishes. No nuts, gluten, or eggs, tags still apply. No overcomplicated. Just herbs, oil, tahini, lemon, garlic, yogurt. That's it. Tweak salt later."
ingredientsNote: "Parsley is traditional but swapping half for fresh mint brings fresh, cool notes. The tahini remains the same to keep that rich, nutty creaminess but adding a bit more lemon juice brightens the flavor. Olive oil quality important—extra virgin works best, adds a grassy richness that balances tahini's earthiness. Garlic kept minimal, finely minced so it blends but doesn't overpower. Yogurt split into two parts to control the texture and blending—half pureed with herbs, half folded for creaminess and subtle body. Salt added last to avoid toughening herbs."
instructionsNote: "Combine fresh herbs and flavorings in blender or food processor first. Let blade pulse for about 7 to 8 minutes intermittently, enough to break down leaves but keep a bit of bite—no total puree. Half yogurt goes in early for a creamy base; blending avoids lumps but keeps texture. Transfer to bowl, and fold remaining yogurt to add a softer texture without overmixing. Season with salt to taste—generously, but adjust to personal preference. Let the sauce rest for five minutes—helps meld flavors. Chill if desired before serving. Use as sauce, dip, or salad dressing. No cooking required, just raw freshness."
tips:
- "Use fresh herbs for best flavor—go for flat-leaf parsley, mint is great too. A good olive oil changes everything; extra virgin is top choice. Blend herbs first, get texture right. Pulse for short bursts, don't overdo it. Mix yogurt in halves. First part blending for smooth, then fold in the rest for body. Adjust salt last; herbs need care."
- "Try variations; add a pinch of chili for heat. Swap in different herbs like cilantro if wanted, even dill works well. Lemon juice brightens the flavor; small changes bring big results. Experiment with ratios: more yogurt for creaminess, less for zing. Always taste before serving. This sauce can be a base for more. Use it boldly."
- "Pair with roasted veggies for contrast, or drizzle on grilled meats. Great for sandwiches. Keep it cold! This is a fresh, raw sauce. No cooking needed. Perfect make-ahead. Can last a few days in fridge, flavor improves slightly. Use within week. Storage? Airtight containers only. Avoid exposure."
- "Chill sauce before serving. Perfect for BBQs or casual dinners. Add to salads, grilled options. It adds brightness. Serve with pita or fresh bread for dipping. Versatile and adaptable; never boring. Don't forget, salt enhances all flavors. Adjust during prep. At the end always check it."
- "Pay attention to blending times; 7 minutes is enough. Keep some herb texture. Overblending ruins it. Watch consistency; aim for creaminess without puree. After mixing, let it rest. Flavors meld better. Five minutes is enough. If too thick? Add olive oil little by little and mix again. Don't rush—taste as you go."
