description: "Dry ingredient layers for a brownie mix in a 750 ml jar. Vegetarian, nut-free, egg-free. Adjusted quantities with cacao swapped for carob powder and black chocolate replaced by dried cranberries for a tart twist. Simple layering creates visual appeal. Mix wet ingredients at home before baking. Storing the jar allows gift-giving-ready mix. Watch for quick baking cues: cracks, moist centers, not a toothpick drenched. Common issues? Flour lumps, sugar clumps. Fix by sifting or shaking the jar. Swap cassonade for coconut sugar if needed. Sensorial: chocolaty aroma, subtle tart bursts from cranberries. Not too sweet, bitter notes balanced. Short bake time with visual checks beats timers."

ingredients:
- "200 ml (7/8 cup) flour all purpose unbleached"
- "1.5 ml (1/3 tsp) salt"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) carob powder"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) light brown sugar"
- "115 ml (1/2 cup) granulated sugar"
- "100 g (3.5 oz) dried cranberries chopped"
instructions:
- "Choose a clean, dry 750 ml jar. Pour flour first, level it, tap gently to settle."
- "Add salt evenly, don’t rush. Layer carob powder next, gently shake sides to avoid clumps."
- "Follow with brown sugar, press lightly. Then granulated sugar layer, smooth surface."
- "Top with chopped dried cranberries instead of chocolate. Close tightly."
- "To bake: preheat oven 175°C (350°F). Mix jar contents with 125 ml melted butter and 60 ml water until just combined — avoid overmix."
- "Pour in a greased 20 cm square pan, spread evenly. Bake 12 ±2 minutes. Edges firm, middle moist but not wobbly."
- "Remove, cool slightly, cracks on top show readiness. Do the toothpick test — moist crumbs, not a soaked tip."
- "Slice once cool. Store airtight. Add chopped nuts or chocolate chips last minute if you want crunch or richness."
- "Trouble with sinking bits? Toss dried fruit in a spoonful of flour before layering. Prevents sinking during baking."
- "If top burns but inside raw, lower oven or cover with foil midway."
introduction: "Brownies in a jar. Giftable, layered dry ingredients sectioned in a glass container. Makes a neat present. I revamped the usual recipe, swapped bitter cacao for carob — milder, no caffeine buzz. Switched chocolate chunks for tart cranberries, adds dimension, surprise bite. No eggs, no nuts here. Shaky jars, layered sugar and flour — takes some patience but creates a nice visual effect. Mixing wet before baking speeds things up. Watch bake time, they go fast. Brownies crack when done, moist feel underneath. Learned to trust textures, not clocks. If browning too fast, drop temp. Common mistake: clumpy cocoa ruins layers; sift or tap jar. This mix brings kitchen aromas without fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Flour - I use unbleached for flavor and structure. Sifting is ideal but shaking suffices. Salt balances sweetness; never skip. Carob powder replaces cacao — less bitter, lighter. Brown sugar adds moisture and depth, granulated sugar sharp sweetness. Coconut sugar works as a swap for a caramel hint. Dried cranberries instead of chocolate bits for chew and tart contrast — if unavailable, raisins or dried cherries. Regular chocolate can be used but adds mess. For nuts, add just before baking or layer on top, keeps texture intact. Store in dry place, sealed tight to prevent moisture ruining the powder layers."
instructionsNote: "Layering order matters for clean strata in jar — flour first, salt dispersed, powders next, sugars, then fruit last. Press each gently to reduce air. Don’t shake violently or ingredients mix prematurely. When ready to bake, mix wet separately, then combine quickly to avoid gluten overdevelopment — no chewy brownies here. Baking time varies—listen for oven sounds, watch for cracks. Edges firm but center jiggles slightly; that’s the sweet spot. If edges brown too soon, foil covers work wonders. Let cool in pan for texture reset. Slice with sharp knife, wipe between cuts. Practical tip — label jars with expiry, ingredients, and directions inside the lid."
tips:
- "Layer ingredients carefully, flour first to avoid lumps, tap jar gently. Salt evenly scattered to balance sugar harshness later. Powder layers go next, shake sides lightly to prevent clumping but don’t mix. Brown sugar pressed but not packed tight, granulated sugar smooth on top. Cranberries dry, chopped and last, keep layers visible. Avoid violent shaking, crust forms better with settled dry strata."
- "Mix wet ingredients separately, butter melted and water joined quickly. Combine with dry mix fast, minimal stirring only. Overmix leads to dense or chewy texture, hard to reverse afterward. Patience to mix just until blended, then straight to pan. Greased 20 cm square, pour, spread evenly but gently to keep air bubbles in check. Bake 175°C; 10–14 minutes range, edges should firm, not browned too dark."
- "Watch cracks on top not as flaws but doneness signals. Moist center feels soft, jiggle when prodded lightly. Toothpick test tricky — avoid soaked tip, crumbs better. Burned top but raw inside means temp off or uneven heat; cover with foil midway helps control. Dry mix with lumps? Use sifter or rapid gentle shakes in jar before layering. Clumped sugar caused by humidity or static; break apart carefully to save layers."
- "Dried fruit sinking happens if layer not prepared well. Toss dried cranberries with small spoonful flour before adding layer for suspension during baking. Prevents fruit from falling to bottom crust. Swap cassonade for coconut sugar if caramel notes wanted, brown sugar keeps moisture. For crunch, nuts or chocolate chips added last minute to batter, not jar, prevents sogginess or soggy texture layers. Store airtight, keep dry to maintain visual appeal and freshness."
- "Jar label with expiration, ingredient listing, and baking directions under lid is practical. Frozen brownies freeze well about 2 weeks, thaw fully before slicing. Substitutions like almond or oat flour for gluten-free, liquid adjustments reductions needed. Coconut oil added to wet mix boosts moist density if mix feels dry. Smell test, sharp carob aroma with fruity cranberry notes letting you know freshness intact. Too sweet? Reduce sugars marginally, dried fruit adds natural sugar."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid flour lumps layering? a: Sifting best but shaking jar helps. Gentle tapping after flour poured then quick gentle shake with salt next layers. Clumps stall smooth stacking so break with spoon if needed. Humidity plays a role too, dry environment preferred."
- "q: Can I substitute cacao with carob easily? a: Carob much milder, less bitter, no caffeine. If swapping dry powders use equal amounts, flavor lighter but sweeter. Some notice woody tones, pairs well with brown sugar or coconut sugar. Chocolate chunk swap works if want richness not tartness of cranberries."
- "q: What if brownies crack too soon or burn? a: Lower oven temp, cover top with foil halfway bake. Cracks early sometimes signal hot oven or dry batter. Moist center jiggle indicator, burnt edges means uneven heat. Using a pan with even heat distribution helps; watch baking, don’t rely solely on timer."
- "q: How to store unopened and baked jar mixes? a: Dry sealed jar stored cool, no moisture, lasts weeks. Once baked, airtight container or wrap tight. Refrigerate prolongs freshness but humidity risk. Freeze sliced brownies for 2 weeks max; thaw before cutting. Label jars to avoid confusion, keep directions handy."
