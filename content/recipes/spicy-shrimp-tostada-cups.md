description: "Tostada cups formed from corn tortillas give that irresistible crunch. Guacamole mashed with sour cream adds creaminess without heavy richness. Shrimp tossed with smoked paprika—my swap for chili powder—hits just right, with a quick pan-sear to pink and curl. Lime juice is key both in guac and at the end to brighten everything. Small tweaks on baking time and temps keep tortillas from burning or flopping. The crunch, the tang, the smoke of paprika all play off each other. Serve on shredded lettuce for a crisp bed. 12 to 14 cups, finger food ready, best eaten immediately."

ingredients:
- "12 corn tortillas"
- "2 ripe avocados"
- "2 tablespoons sour cream"
- "2 medium plum tomatoes diced"
- "1⁄3 cup finely chopped red onion"
- "1 tablespoon hot sauce (your choice; I use Cholula or Valentina)"
- "2 tablespoons fresh lime juice plus extra wedges"
- "1⁄4 teaspoon fine sea salt"
- "1 tablespoon vegetable oil"
- "24 medium peeled and deveined shrimp"
- "1 tablespoon smoked paprika (substitute for chili powder)"
- "1 cup shredded iceberg or romaine lettuce"
- "optional garnish Maldon sea salt or chile powder"
instructions:
- "=== Tostada Cups ==="
- "Oven to 345°F—slightly lower keeps tortillas from over-browning before crisping. Lightly oil each well plus spray scent-free oil on bottom of a second cupcake tin to weight them down."
- "Wrap 6 tortillas in damp paper towels. Microwave 12 seconds tops to loosen pliability—the tortillas should bend, not crack."
- "Cut a slit halfway through each to let edges overlap snug into muffin cups. Press and fold carefully, no rips; fold one outside edge under if needed for perfect cup shape. Set next 6 and repeat."
- "Cover gently with second oiled cupcake tin to stop tortilla springing back during baking."
- "Bake 13 to 18 minutes; watch for toasty edges, slight golden blush on surfaces. Crisp but not burnt—tortillas darken fast after this stage."
- "Remove, let cool in tins to keep shape. If soggy, toast quickly in dry pan or oven later for crunch revival."
- "=== Guacamole Mix ==="
- "Halve avocados, scoop, mash coarse with sour cream—no blender, keep texture. Sour cream tames avocado oiliness and adds tang. Perfect substitute: Greek yogurt."
- "Fold in diced tomatoes, chopped onion, hot sauce, 2 tablespoons lime juice and salt. Taste for balance—a bit more lime if too bland; more hot sauce if mild."
- "Set aside but refrigerate only briefly to avoid browning."
- "=== Spicy Shrimp Sear ==="
- "Heat oil in skillet over medium heat—oil shimmering but not smoking."
- "Toss shrimp with smoked paprika (why smoked? It’s richer, earthy, better for shrimp’s sweetness). Season lightly with salt."
- "Add shrimp; hear that immediate sizzle? Stir often to cook evenly."
- "Shrimp will turn pink and curl—key visual cue—about 4-6 minutes depending on size. Overcook and it’s rubber city. Under cook and it’s mushy. Use smell too: shrimp smell sharp and briny when close."
- "Remove and drain on paper towels."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Put a handful shredded lettuce in each cup—bed for moisture and crunch contrast."
- "Dollop guacamole, spreading gently but keep thickness for creaminess layers."
- "Add 2 shrimp per cup, nestle carefully so cups don’t collapse."
- "Spritz with fresh lime juice from wedge and dust lightly with chile powder or flaky sea salt."
- "Eat immediately; cups hold shape and crunch best fresh. Leftover stored will soften."
- "=== Notes ==="
- "Microwaving tortillas just before shaping makes all the difference in neat cups; cold or dry will crack."
- "If you don’t have muffin tins, gently fold tortillas in foil cups to bake but shape less precise."
- "Sour cream swap: plain yogurt or crema if available for milder tang."
- "Hot sauce: any favorite will work, just adjust intensity."
- "Shrimp: peeled and deveined frozen works too, thawed fully, pat dry for proper sear."
- "Watch shrimp carefully—they go from perfect to tough fast."
- "Paprika smoked or sweet, chili powder, cayenne all valid but play with intensity. My experience? Smoked paprika nails complexity without too much heat."
- "Oven times vary; always check early."
- "Cups can be prepped early but assembly right before serving."
- "Leftovers soggy? Toast cups alone for few minutes to resurrect crunch but guac best made fresh."
introduction: "Crunchy tortilla cups. Tried rigid tortillas folded into muffin tins before—brittle mess, kitchen cursed. Learned microwave softens, folds cleanly. Didn’t guess sour cream in guacamole would tame fat, add subtle tang till I tried Greek yogurt as swap. Shrimp—never plain chili powder again. Smoked paprika adds that toasty aroma, deeper flavor, punches shrimp’s natural sweetness. Heat medium, watch for color, curl signaling done—chewy shrimp ruins vibe. Lime juice wakes dull moments, in guacamole and on top. Lettuce bed optional but gives fresh snap. Ultimate finger food. Get crisp edges, creamy center, spice bite, zingy lime. Leftovers yes but best fresh—soft cups lose charm fast."
ingredientsNote: "Corn tortillas must be fresh enough to bend without cracking; stale ones snap, fold awkward. Microwave in damp paper towel, short bursts—overheat makes them tough. Sour cream in guacamole cuts richness; you can sub Greek yogurt or Mexican crema for different tang, prevents browning slightly. Tomatoes diced small prevent watery guacamole. Onion finely chopped to blend but adds crunch in every bite. Hot sauce—choose your poison. I like Cholula for balanced heat. Lime juice crucial; adds bite and preserves color a bit. Smoked paprika swaps nicely for chili powder—adds smoky layer without harsh heat. Oil for shrimp should be neutral—vegetable or avocado. Shrimp size matters; medium are easy to cook evenly but can use large. Pat dry shrimp to avoid steaming and soggy cups. Lettuce adds crunch and helps soak up avocado oils. Maldon sea salt flakes finish with texture and subtle ocean burst."
instructionsNote: "Temperature control vital; ovens vary wildly—watch tortillas closely from 10 minutes. Lift and peek after 12 minutes; edges golden, center still flexible. Press lightly to test crispness; too soft means longer bake. Second cupcake tin pressure shapes without popping up edges. Guacamole mix done by hand, no blender. Avoid overmashing—chunky better for texture. Shrimp cook fast—must hear sizzle on hit. Overcrowding pan prevents proper browning. Stir shrimp gently; too much flipping breaks them. Color is main guide—bright pink, opaque, curled. Remove to paper towels immediately; holding shrimp in hot pan keeps cooking and toughens. Assembly last minute keeps tortillas crisp. Lettuce placed first absorbs some moisture, keeps bottom dry. Dollop guacamole thickly; thin spreading leaks outside cups. Garnish lime spritz at end balances fat and heat. Leftovers must separate components for crispness on reheating; tostada cups alone revive well in toaster oven or pan."
tips:
- "Microwave tortillas wrapped in damp paper towels briefly. Too long and they get stiff, crack when folding. Too short and cups won’t shape right. Watch that pliability like a hawk. Fold sharply but gentle enough to avoid rips. If the edges don’t overlap snugly, cups lose form and leak ingredients later."
- "Use sour cream in the guacamole mix to tame avocado oiliness without drowning flavor. Greek yogurt or crema work well too but shift the tang. Keep guac chunky, no blender. Texture adds bite and keeps moisture from making tortillas soggy too fast when assembled."
- "For shrimp, dry thoroughly before seasoning. Water on surface prevents crisp sear, ends in steam, chewy texture. Heat oil until shimmer but avoid actual smoke point. Smoked paprika adds a nuttier warmth than chili powder; doesn’t overpower shrimp sweetness. Stir often but gently to avoid breaking the flesh."
- "Oven temp matters. 345°F is lower than usual but helps avoid burnt spots on tortillas. Use second cupcake tin on top to weight shells, stop them popping edges up. Start checking crispness around 12 minutes. Press center lightly; soft means longer bake. Toast soggy cups later in dry pan or oven for crunch revival."
- "Assemble quickly. Lettuce bed soaks excess avocado oil, keeps bottom crisp. Dollop guacamole thick, don’t spread thin or it leaks out. Shrimp nests on top careful, two per cup. Fresh lime juice spritz brightens, balances fat. Dust with chile powder or flaky Maldon sea salt for texture contrast. Eat fast; leftover cups soften quickly."
faq:
- "q: Can I use plain yogurt instead of sour cream? a: Yes but tang shifts a bit sharper. Creaminess drop too. Greek yogurt or crema smoother. Adjust lime juice if tang feels off. Refrigerate briefly to keep bright green; goes brown fast otherwise."
- "q: Best way to tell shrimp is done? a: Pink, curled tight but not too tight. Smell sharp, briny smell. Firm flesh springs back on poke. Avoid overcooking–shrimp turn rubbery quick. Stir often but gently helps even cook, stops browning spots."
- "q: What if tortillas crack when folding? a: Usually too dry or cold. Re-microwave wrapped briefly or cover with damp towel while working. Stale tortillas snap no matter length. Fresh needed for clean fold. Foil cups okay but shape less defined."
- "q: How to store leftovers without soggy shells? a: Keep components separate if possible. Tostada cups alone toasted briefly revive crisp. Guac best fresh but refrigerate tight-lid short term. Lettuce wilts fast, add fresh if leftovers planned."
