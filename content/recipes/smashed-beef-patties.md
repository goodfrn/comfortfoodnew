slug: "smashed-beef-patties"
description: "Frozen medium-lean beef patties browned then simmered in a thick mushroom sauce. Butter used for richness but swap with olive oil if dairy is iffy. Mushrooms sautéed till golden with flour dusted to thicken the broth with reduced-sodium beef stock and Worcestershire for umami. Covered finish cooks through the patties evenly. Great with mashed corn-potatoes and spicy butter, if you want some kick. Timing flexible; rely on browned edges and sauce thickening cues. A classic, tweaked with oyster mushrooms for earthiness. Quick midweek meal, little fuss, big taste."

ingredients:
- "4 frozen medium-lean beef patties about 160 g 5.5 oz each"
- "50 g 3 tablespoons butter unsalted"
- "225 g ½ lb oyster mushrooms halved (sub white button if needed)"
- "25 ml 1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour"
- "450 ml 1¾ cups low-sodium beef broth (homemade or store-bought)"
- "15 ml 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Pat dry frozen patties with paper towel if they feel damp. Use half the butter 25 g in a heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place patties; listen for sizzle. Brown one side till deep mahogany, about 5-6 minutes. Flip carefully, same on the other side. Salt and pepper during cooking. Once well-browned, remove onto plate. Don't overcook here or patties toughen. Wipe pan with paper towel to remove excess fat."
- "Add remaining butter to hot pan. Toss in mushrooms, stir frequently, they’ll loosen moisture then start browning. Around 6 minutes, sprinkle flour evenly, stirring so no lumps; smell toasted flour but don’t burn. Gradually pour beef broth while whisking to avoid clumps. Splash Worcestershire in; sauce should bubble and thicken within 3 minutes. Taste sauce—adjust salt or pepper now."
- "Nestle patties back in sauce. Reduce heat to low-medium; cover pan. End gently cooking for 7-8 minutes. Thickness of patties means internal temp should hit 160 F 71 C or juices run clear; poke with fork to check; no pink juices. Sauce thickened to nice coating stage, not gluey. Remove cover; let simmer 1 extra minute uncovered if sauce not thick enough."
- "Serve patties hot, spoon mushroom sauce over. Goes well with creamy mashed corn-potatoes to cut richness. Add harissa butter or plain butter to mash for extra depth. If mushrooms run scarce, dried porcini soaked briefly rehydrate well or combo with fresh. For no-dairy swap butter with oil but expect missing richness; add a splash of cream or non-dairy milk at end if tolerated."
- "Know pan types: Thin pans burn sauce edges – use heavy-bottom skillet for even heat. Do not stir patties while browning; flipping too soon tears crust. Thicken sauce to nappe consistency coats spoon cleanly; if too thin, cook uncovered few mins longer, too thick add broth splash. Feel free to increase mushrooms for a meatier sauce or add chopped fresh thyme during cooking."
introduction: "Frozen beef patties, sometimes overlooked but convenient. I learned that browning them right, crisp edges before simmer, locks flavor and juices. Mushrooms add juicy texture and earthy aroma—oyster mushrooms especially good here, not the bland button ones. Butter carries flavor but olive oil works if dairy's no-go. That flour sprinkle is a must: not just thickening, it builds a velvety coating you want clinging to the meat. These cook quick, 40 minutes tops but you gauge doneness by color and firmness. I always check the juices instead of timer alone; it saves dry meat disasters. Sauce bubbles thickly before patties rejoin, no lumps, no raw flour taste. Served over creamy corn-infused mashed potatoes with a spicy butter kick—comfort food elevated by simple swaps and cooking smarts."
ingredientsNote: "Patties: frozen, not fresh. It’s about firmness and handling. Thawing creates water; pat dry or seasoning will dilute. Butter is traditional but olive oil or ghee can replace; expect flavor shift and lower creaminess. Mushrooms: oyster bring woody, meaty notes; swapping button mushrooms is fine but less pronounced flavor. Flour needed for thickening; whole wheat flour adds earthiness but watch color - burns quicker. Beef broth preferably low-sodium – high salt makes sauce flat fast. Worcestershire adds tang and depth, no replacement equates to less umami; soy sauce is a backup but salt levels differ. Salt & pepper added during browning, not just at the end—layered seasoning’s key."
instructionsNote: "Browning frozen patties needs patience—don’t flip too soon or crust tears, listen for sizzle and watch edges darken. Half butter first, saves it from burning later. After patties rest, wiping pan prevents scorched bits ruining sauce. Mushroom sauté medium heat: avoid overcrowding pan for even browning; stirring often helps moisture evaporate. Flour sprinkled last clears raw starch away, cook 60 seconds max or risk flour flavor. Pour broth gradually, whisking constantly stops clumps building. Sauce bubbles then thickens; if not thick enough, reduce heat and simmer uncovered. Adding patties back, cover and cook gently so meat finishes cooking in sauce steam, locking moisture. Poke patties to test, cut if unsure; juices should be clear not pink for safe eating. Serve immediately or sauce thickens further."
tips:
- "Pat patties dry always when frozen. Moisture steals sear. Half butter first to avoid burning. Listen for sizzle. Brown deep mahogany edges before flipping. Don’t rush or crust tears, starts breaking flavors."
- "After patties rest wipe pan fat off. Helps sauce clean not greasy. Mushrooms cook medium heat only. Crowding traps water, no browning, mushy texture. Stir often but gently for even color and moisture loss."
- "Flour sprinkle—dust evenly. Stir fast to avoid lumps. Toast smell comes early then watch color. Too dark means bitter flour taste. Pour broth slowly, whisk constantly to keep sauce smooth. Should bubble thick after 3 minutes."
- "Nestle patties gently back. Cover pan cooks through steam, locks juice. Don’t stir patties now or crust breaks. Internal temp 160 F necessary. Check by poking juices clear, no pink. Sauce coats spoon nappe style at end."
- "If sauce too thin simmer uncovered one-two minutes more. Too thick add broth splash only. Switching butter for oil works but expect less creamy mouthfeel. Add cream or non-dairy milk end if needed. Mushrooms scarce? Porcini soak quick for depth."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid soggy patties? a: Pat dry well frozen or thawed. Moisture kills sear. Half butter first browning side only. Don’t flip early. Listen for sizzle, dark edges show ready."
- "q: Can I swap oyster mushrooms? a: Button mushrooms ok but less flavor. Porcini soaked rehydrates well adds earthiness. Mixed mushrooms also fine for texture mix but shrinks faster usually."
- "q: Sauce lumps form how fix? a: Whisk flour with mushrooms fast after sprinkling. Add broth slow, whisk constantly. If lumps appear simmer longer stirring gently or strain if needed."
- "q: What about leftovers storage? a: Refrigerate in sealed container 3 days max. Reheat gently low heat keeps sauce texture. Freeze possible but sauce may separate slightly. Stir well when reheating."
