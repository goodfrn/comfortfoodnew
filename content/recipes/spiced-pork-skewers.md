- "=== Marinade ==="
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) lemon juice"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "1 ml (1/2 tsp) ground cumin"
- "Pinch saffron threads"
- "Pinch crushed red pepper flakes"

- "Salt and black pepper"
- "4 wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes"
instructions:
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "Combine oil, lemon, paprika, cumin, saffron, and chili flakes in a bowl or sealable bag. Toss pork cubes in marinade until well coated. Cover or seal and refrigerate at least 10 hours."
- "Heat grill to medium, brush grate with oil to prevent sticking."
- "Thread pork onto soaked skewers evenly. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Grill skewers about 4 to 5 minutes per side for medium doneness or adjust to preference."
- "Serve immediately alongside grilled vegetables or salad."
introduction: "Pork with heat, smoky notes, zing of lemon. Spanish spices but tweaked. Saffron adds color, cumin replaces coriander for earthier tone. Chili flakes for kick. Olive oil keeps it juicy. Marinate long, at least 10 hours, overnight better. Grilling on medium means char outside, pink inside. Wood skewers soak to prevent burning. Meat cubes bite-sized, easy to cook evenly. Quick cook time but worth the wait. Easy to pair with veggies. No dairy, nuts, gluten, eggs here. Simple proteins, bold taste. Chunky, juicy, spicy. Get grill ready, heat steady, oil the rack. Meat sizzles. Turn often. Serve hot."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil chosen for its fruity richness and high smoke point, helping keep pork tender and keeping marinade well bound. Lemon juice brightens, cuts fat. Switched coriander for cumin; cumin's nuttier, more earthy, modifies original's fresh herbiness. Reduced paprika slightly for balance, keeping smoky base but less intense. Saffron pinches in, not overpowering but subtle amber tint and aroma. Red pepper flakes instead of paprika heat variants to add crackle of spice. Pork tenderloin cubed ensures quick, uniform cooking; marinate in sealed bag prevents air drying, maximizing flavor absorption. Soaking skewers avoids burning on grill. Salt and pepper last step, sealing flavor on the grill, not drawing out moisture prematurely."
instructionsNote: "Start marinade mixing oil, citrus, spices. Coat pork fully, press marinade in, seal tight to avoid spilling smells in fridge. 10 hours minimum, longer for depth. Medium heat on grill essential; too hot chars outside, undercooks inside. Oil grill grate well to prevent stick, keeps grill marks clean. Meat threaded evenly on skewers—care not to crowd to allow even heat. Season final with salt, pepper to finish. Grill 4-5 minutes each side offers juicy pink center, adjust by thickness. Quick turn cycles keep grill marks and prevent overcooking. Serve immediately to preserve juiciness. Vegetables on skewers can mirror spice profile or balance heat with freshness. Timing is key: preheat grill before skewering meat, marinade done, so skewers go on hot rack promptly."
tips:
- "Use high-quality olive oil. It’s key. Fruitiness contrasts the spices. Smoke point is essential. Keeps pork juicy. Marinade binds well too. Citrus bright. Combine spices. Adjust for heat. Pinches equilibrium. Keep saffron subtle, a hint. Balance between richness and zing. Timing is crucial."
- "Grill at medium heat, do not rush. Too hot? Outside chars, inside raw. Monitor closely. Oil grill grate generously. Prevents sticking. Sweeping turns ensure consistent cook, marks are key. Skewers aligned uniformly. Crowding is enemy. Make sure meat is spaced well. Cook times vary based on thickness."
- "Resting is vital after grilling. Juices redistribute. Waiting minutes makes a difference. Marinade longer if time allows. Depth of flavor increases. Chill skewers, allow to cool before serving. Side dishes can mirror spices. Pair with fresh veggies for contrast. Adjust serving temperature."
- "Keep ingredients ready. Marinade preparation must be straightforward. Check all items before starting. Assembly line to speed things up. Skewering should be efficient and even. Salt after grilling. Enhances taste. Prevents moisture loss while cooking. Timing balances out flavors. Quick cook, then serve."
- "Use soaked wooden skewers to avoid burning. Important step. Water keeps material stable. Not charred or splitting. Make sure they're submerged ahead. File skewer ends for easier threading. Cut meat into uniform cubes. Ensures even cooking after marinating. Consistency is key in results."
faq:
- "q: What is the best way to marinate pork? a: Combine oil, acids like lemon. Add spices in proportions. Coat meat well, seal tightly to preserve aromas. Refrigerate minimum 10 hours. Longer increases flavor absorption."
- "q: Can I use a different cut of pork? a: Yes, options include loin or shoulder. Such cuts add different textures. But consider fat content and cook times vary based on the choice. Leaner cuts may dry out faster."
- "q: How should I store leftover skewers? a: Refrigerate promptly if not consumed. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or place in container. Ensure tight seal. Consume within 3 days for best taste. Reheat gently, avoid drying."
- "q: What if I don't have a grill? a: Oven broiling is good. Preheat, place skewers on broiler pan. Rotate often to cook evenly. Also, grilling pan or skillet works. Adjust cooking time based on thickness."
