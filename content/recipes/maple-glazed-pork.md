ingredients:
- "125 ml vegetable broth"
- "50 ml maple syrup"
- "5 ml apple cider vinegar"
- "5 ml Dijon mustard"
- "5 ml tomato paste"
- "5 ml arrowroot starch"
- "1 pork tenderloin approx 400 g"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "1 small shallot, finely chopped"
- "fresh thyme sprigs (optional)"
instructions:
- "1. Whisk vegetable broth, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, tomato paste, and arrowroot starch in a bowl until smooth. Set aside. Note the gloss—arrowroot lends clarity to the sauce."
- "2. Trim pork tenderloin of silver skin. Cut into medallions about 1.5 cm thick. Pat dry firmly with paper towels. Moisture kills the sear, so don’t rush."
- "3. Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in heavy skillet. Once shimmering and fragrant, add half the medallions spaced out. Don’t crowd. Listen for that satisfying sizzle."
- "4. Sear pork about 2 minutes each side. Flip when golden brown crust forms. Medallions should spring back but still tender. Transfer to plate. Repeat with rest, adding a touch more oil if pan dry."
- "5. Reduce heat to medium. Toss in shallots, stirring 1-2 minutes until soft and translucent—not browned. Smell opens up here."
- "6. Pour in broth mixture, stir. Sauce will bubble and thicken. Throw in thyme sprigs if using. Return pork to pan, nestling into sauce."
- "7. Simmer gently 3-4 minutes, turning medallions once. Sauce should thicken to glossy coat consistency—sticks lightly to back of spoon."
- "8. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and cracked black pepper. Remove thyme before serving."
- "Serve with mashed sweet potatoes or roasted root vegetables. Perfect for clearing leftovers from fridge the next day; sauce reheats well, thickens more."
introduction: "Mid-cooking, smell hits—sweet yet sharp, marrying maple and tangy vinegar with pork seared crust. Pork medallions cook fast; timing is everything. Too long and it dries, too short leaves raw cut inside. Maple syrup gets swapped for less sugar impact; apple cider vinegar cuts the sweetness and layers acidity. Using arrowroot starch instead of cornstarch yields translucent, shinier sauce without cloudiness. The shallot, not onion, adds subtle sweetness without overpowering. Makes a great quick dinner weekday favorite. Easy adjustments let you adapt to what’s in the pantry. Fresh thyme brings earthiness, optional but elevates flavor balance. Visual doneness and textural cues guide your cooking, not clock alone. Techniques refined over years of searing and rescues after dried chops. Flattened pork tenderloin gives medallions that perfect thickness to capture heat evenly."
ingredientsNote: "Broth swap important if no chicken broth: vegetable broth works well, mild flavor, less salt. Maple syrup quantity reduced slightly to avoid overly sweet finish—adjust to taste depending on your syrup’s intensity. Arrowroot starch preferred for a clearer glaze; it thickens better at lower temps and doesn’t turn gummy like cornstarch can if overheated. Tomato paste replaces ketchup to cut excess sugar and adds depth. Apple cider vinegar offers bright acidity, balance, and tenderizing effect. Olive oil used instead of butter for cleaner sear without burning risk, but butter can be added at end for richness if tolerated. Shallots over onions: milder, less bite, they dissolve better and give a refined onion note. Pork selection: tenderloin trimmed and patted dry introduces best surface for caramelization. Don’t skip drying meat—wet surfaces steam not sear."
instructionsNote: "Start whisking sauce mix early to ensure starch is fully dispersed, no lumps. Timing and heat control key stepping stones here. The sizzle upon hitting hot oil means the pan is ready; if quiet it’s too cool, meat will stew. Don’t flip too early—wait for crust formation. Medallions springing back when poked signals doneness; squishy means undercooked. Shallots must sweat not brown, their sweetness unlocking aroma without bitterness. Pour sauce mix into rested pan to deglaze and pick up fond flavor chunks. Stir constantly until sauce thickens and turns glossy—sign that arrowroot kicked in. Simmer gently not boil hard or arrowroot breaks down, liquid becomes thin again. Nestle pork back carefully into sauce for even coating and warming. Taste several steps, salt gradually; maple and vinegar already add flavor complexity. Serve straight away or keep warm in low oven. Clean the pan with a sticky sauce by soaking promptly to avoid dried sugar residue."
tips:
- "Dry pork medallions thoroughly before searing. Water ruins the crust. Pat with paper towels, press firmly. Listen for that sharp sizzle when oil hits pan. If oil shimmers but no sizzle, pan’s not hot enough. Flip only after crust forms; it’ll spring back when ready. Medallions around 1.5 cm thick cook in roughly 4-5 minutes total. Thickness matters for even cooking. Too thick? Longer cook, risk dry edges. Thin won’t have crust. Timing and thickness play hand in hand."
- "Use arrowroot starch cold whisked into liquids. Clumps kill the gloss. Pour starch mix in slowly after shallots sweat – no browning there, just translucent softness. Stir constantly, bubble to thicken. Arrowroot breaks down with aggressive boiling; simmer gently. Thickened sauce clings lightly to spoon back, glossy and translucent. Avoid cornstarch for cloudier glaze and gummy texture. This starch works at lower heat, stays clear even after cooling. Good for recipes where sauce clarity matters."
- "Swap chicken broth with vegetable broth for milder, cleaner flavor. Works well here; pork and maple dominate anyway. Adjust salt since veg broth usually less salty. Maple syrup quantity depends on syrup intensity and sweetness level preferred. Less than expected better for tang balance; cider vinegar cuts it sharp, balances sweetness, and tenderizes meat too. Tomato paste adds umami depth, avoids ketchup sweetness and thickens slightly. Measured small amounts keep sauce tight, not sloppy."
- "Olive oil preferred for sear’s clean brown flavor and higher smoke point than butter. Butter can be added at end if tolerated for richness, but risk burning during sear is higher. Start hot, medium-high heat. Add medallions spaced out, no crowding or steaming occurs. Listen for sizzle; pan silence means cool or too crowded. Add more oil mid-cook if dryness felt.Cooking on high too long burns edges; flip when crust golden, not black. Medallions will spring back slightly when touched, firm but with some give."
- "Shallots over onions prevent harsh bite. Sweat gently 1-2 minutes, just soft translucent, no browning. Browning changes flavor profile, can overpower sauce’s subtle balance. Pour sauce mix into pan after shallots soften to deglaze fond, picking up caramelized bits. Nestle pork back carefully in sauce for even heat, coating each piece. Simmer gently 3-4 min, turning medallions once to ensure glaze thickens around. Remove thyme before serving to avoid woody bits. Salt and pepper last - taste as you go since broth, vinegar, and tomato paste contribute their own layers."
faq:
- "q: Can I use cornstarch instead of arrowroot? a: Cornstarch works but expect cloudy sauce. Arrowroot gives clear glossy finish and won’t gum up or break down quickly. If cooking over high heat or boiling hard, cornstarch can turn gluey. Use arrowroot for gentle simmer finish. Keep starch slurry cold and whisk well to avoid lumps before adding to pan."
- "q: How do I know when pork medallions are cooked? a: Look for golden brown crust, sizzle sound fading. Medallions spring back when poked with finger or spatula, not squishy. Cut one to check pink center if unsure. Thickness affects time—about 2 min per side for 1.5 cm thick. Too short means raw inside. Longer cooks dry out edges. Visual and texture cues beat just watching clock."
- "q: What if I don’t have shallots? a: Small sweet onion works but expect stronger aroma and bite. Cook lower and slow longer to soften and lessen harshness. Shallots dissolve better, add subtle sweetness without bitterness. Avoid yellow onions raw; they overpower sauce balance. Alternatively skip or use garlic sparingly, but flavor shifts. Shallot’s mildness key here."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, transfer to airtight container. Refrigerate up to 2 days safely. Reheat gently in pan with splash of broth or water to loosen glaze. Microwave OK but glaze texture changes, can thicken oddly. Freeze only if you plan quick rescues; glaze may separate but stirs back after warming. Avoid reheating glaze at high temp or it thins out again."
