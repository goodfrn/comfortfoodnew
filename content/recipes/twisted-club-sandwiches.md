ingredients:
- "16 slices of bacon (around 400 g / 14 oz)"
- "12 eggs slightly beaten"
- "175 ml (just under 3/4 cup) garlic mayonnaise (use garlic aioli instead of plain mayo for a punch)"
- "Salt and pepper"
- "18 slices square white sandwich bread"
- "18 slices ripe tomato"
- "12 Boston lettuce leaves"
- "Toothpicks"
instructions:
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "Position oven rack slightly below center. Preheat oven to 215 °C (425 °F). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Also, line a 38 x 25 cm (15 x 10 in) baking dish with parchment, letting paper hang over edges. Lightly oil parchment and sides—important for loaf release."
- "Arrange bacon on lined baking sheet in single layer, no overlap. Pop into oven. You'll hear sizzle, see fat render. 10 to 13 minutes is your window—watch for golden edges, not burnt black. Flip the slices halfway to get even crispness. Drain bacon on paper towels, leave fat behind to avoid greasy sandwich."
- "=== Eggs and Assembly ==="
- "In a bowl, whisk eggs with 55 ml (a bit over 1/4 cup) garlic mayo. Salt and pepper well; mayo adds moisture and richness that pulls eggs together without turning rubbery. Pour into prepared baking dish. Bake 9 to 11 minutes until set but still moist. Dry edges mean overcooked. Cut the baked egg slab into six squares. Leave these cooling a bit."
- "Switch oven off and tuck bacon back inside to stay warm and keep crisp."
- "Toast bread until golden and slightly firm. Slather each piece evenly with the remaining garlic mayo before building the layers."
- "To build each sandwich: bottom slice, layer egg piece, three bacon slices. Second slice of bread goes on top. Then three tomato slices, followed by two Boston lettuce leaves. Crown with the last bread slice pressed gently into place. Insert toothpicks at four corners to stabilize the stack, then slice diagonally into neat triangles. Repeat for all sandwiches."
introduction: "Big breakfasts demand a sturdy sandwich to hold up under all that bacon and eggs. Started out using plain mayo once, ended up with dry eggs and floppy bread. Garlic aioli changed the game; moisture locked in the eggs, and the hint of garlic punched up layers without overpowering. Oven crisped bacon frees up stovetop, cuts smoke. Toasted bread not just texture—it’s the foundation that grips all the juicy layers. Cutting sandwiches into triangles makes them easier to manage, toothpicks hold it all together without piercing lips. Watching bacon go from fatty and lumpy to thin, crackling strips sealed the deal. This is a heft you can sink into. Not just food, but a brash morning ritual."
ingredientsNote: "Bacon weight adjusted down a bit to avoid overcrowding and soggy grease pools. Garlic mayo is a simple swap—adds depth and binds the egg without extra dairy, perfect for lactose intolerant pals. If you can’t find Boston lettuce, Romaine works but it’s less tender, crushes the vibe; iceberg is too watery. Toast the bread evenly but don’t overly dry; just enough crunch to keep the sandwich from collapsing. For eggs, baking in mayo is a neat trick, keeps them tender but almost firm enough to slice neatly. If short on time, eggs can be pan cooked gently, but watch that moist texture. Leftover mixtures can turn gummy if overbaked or under seasoned—salt and pepper balance is key. If you want a smoky twist, a pinch of smoked paprika in eggs replaces extra bacon fat."
instructionsNote: "Oven temp variations need sensory adjustments—listen for bacon crackle, watch edges darken but not char. Turning bacon halfway prevents curling; uneven bacon ruins stack. Egg batter needs checking—edges firm, center jiggly but not wet. Overcooked eggs crumble, undercooked means sloppy sandwiches. Leftover bacon fat can crisp the bread edges on stove for bonus crunch. Dipping bread in bacon fat before toasting is tempting but risky—can cause uneven crisping and greasy bites. Mayo spread acts like glue; leave no bare spots or layers separate in first bites. Toothpicks can stab your teeth if inserted sloppily; push just enough to hold. Slicing sandwiches cold improves triangle hold but warm feels better in mouth. Keeping sandwiches warm in turned-off oven is a good trick—avoids wilting lettuce and keeps bacon crunchy."
tips:
- "Oven rack placement matters—slightly below center traps heat just right for bacon crisp. Watch bacon edges, golden not black; last minute smell tells. Flip halfway, veins uniform. Don’t overcrowd sheet; fat pools make soggy bacon. Drain bacon on towels, but don’t press or you lose crunch."
- "Baking eggs in garlic mayo keeps texture slightly springy, moisture locked. Pour batter thin in oiled dish, low bubbles preferred. Salt properly—undermining flavor ruins mouth feel. Watch edges firm while center jiggles gently. Overbake? Crumbly mess. Underbake? Eggs slip, hard to slice neat squares."
- "Toast bread until color shifts, light crackle but soft core remains. Spread garlic mayo in generous layer to bind multiple fillings. Mayo isn’t just flavor–it glues layers, stops sandwich from sliding apart first bites. Spread evenly; bare spots mean collapse."
- "Use Boston lettuce for tender crispness; Romaine fallback but toughness trips bite. Iceberg too watery, kills texture balance. Tomato slices should be ripe but not mushy, freshness key. Layer evenly, avoid stacking too thick; bite struggles increase."
- "Sandwich assembly order critical: bottom bread, egg square, three bacon slices laid flat before next bread. Add tomato and lettuce carefully. Final bread top pressed gently but firmly seals stack. Toothpicks at corners stabilize sandwich. Slice cold or warm—cold aids clean triangle, warm feels better inside mouth."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other kinds of lettuce? a: Yeah, Romaine works but tougher—bite gets rougher. Iceberg is watery, ends soggy sandwich faster. Boston ideal if found. Texture matters here, crunchy hold against soft egg and mayo."
- "q: What if I don’t have garlic mayo? a: Use plain mayo but add garlic powder or crushed garlic finely minced. Aioli works too. The garlic presence lifts egg flavor, moistens better. Skip mayo? Eggs dry up, bread soggy faster."
- "q: How to keep bacon crisp after baking? a: Drain well on paper towels, avoid stacking while hot or steam traps moisture. Keep warm in turned-off oven briefly—won’t soften. Reheat strips in pan for crunch restore if cooled too long."
- "q: Storage tips for leftovers? a: Wrap sandwiches tight in foil or container. Fridge best but sandwich softens overnight. Re-toast bread edges or press on griddle before eating to recover crisp. Avoid micro if can; dries egg, heats uneven. Eat within 24 hours for best hold."
