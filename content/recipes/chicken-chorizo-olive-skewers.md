ingredients:
- "700 g (about 1 ⅓ lb) boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cubed (~34 cubes)"
- "35 ml (2 ½ tbsp) olive oil"
- "3 ml (⅗ tsp) crushed fennel seeds"
- "3 ml (⅗ tsp) cracked black peppercorns"
- "3 ml (⅗ tsp) curry powder"
- "1.5 ml (½ tsp) kosher salt"
- "32 slices chorizo sausage, roughly 1 cm (½ in) thick"
- "32 green olives, pitted and rinsed"
- "8 metal or soaked wooden skewers"
- "1 lemon, quartered (optional garnish)"
- "Tzatziki sauce, as desired (optional)"
- "Hummus, as desired (optional)"
instructions:
- "Mix chicken cubes with olive oil, spices including fennel seeds, cracked pepper, curry powder, and kosher salt in a bowl. Toss gently to coat all pieces evenly. Let rest 10 minutes if you have time, but no more."
- "Thread skewers alternating chunks of chicken (~4 per skewer), slices of chorizo (6 per skewer), and green olives (6 per skewer). The order matters little; I stagger them randomly for even heat and color."
- "Preheat grill to high, oil grates well to avoid sticking. Lay skewers over direct heat; listen for sizzle—sudden, sharp, not soft hissing."
- "Grill 3-4 minutes per side, watch color turn from pale pink to opaque ivory with seared edges. Avoid charring; burnt bits smell bitter, kill those bites."
- "Shift skewers to cooler spot (indirect heat zone). Close lid, continue cooking 10-12 minutes. Test doneness by gently pressing chicken pieces: firm yet springy. Internal temp around 74°C (165°F) if you insist on thermometers."
- "Remove skewers, allow rest 5 minutes on warm platter. Meat juices redistribute, keeps bites juicy."
- "Serve with lemon wedges, sprinkle juice over hot skewers. Offer tzatziki or hummus on the side. Creamy sauces cut through the spice and salt nicely."
- "Cleanup tip: If using wooden skewers, soak at least 30 minutes before to prevent burning."
introduction: "Always had trouble balancing smoky chorizo with juicy chicken. Tried thighs, breasts, mix — thighs hold moisture better under fire but breasts curl up more. Now, a combo works best; cubes stay plump. The key is grilling fast-hot first for the sear, auditory cues like crackle and aroma that shift from raw funk to warm spice fizz. Moving to indirect heat after forms crust, lets the cook gently finish without drying out. Olives add salty bursts, offsetting the fatty chorizo slices. I usually toss a bit more curry powder than recipes suggest — reflects my spice tolerance. Lemon juice at the end? Essential to brighten everything, cuts through richness, wakes taste buds. Trust the textures — firm, resilient chicken signals done, no stab needed. Sauce? Always creamy, never just mustard or ketchup. Tzatziki’s fresh coolness is a redemption arc for grilled meats, hummus adds a rustic charm. Both optional but highly recommended."
ingredientsNote: "Switched out salt from fine table to kosher — less dense, easier to manage, avoids over-salting. Curry powder quantity nudged upward 20% by feel — curry ties fennel’s anise notes and pepper’s heat neatly with chorizo’s smokiness. Fennel seeds you want cracked, not ground into dust; texture in bites adds surprise. If no chorizo, try smoked sausage like andouille, or spiced kielbasa for a different depth but keep texture variations. Green olives best pitted and rinsed: rinsing tempers briny punch, otherwise can overwhelm. Wooden skewers need soaking — don’t skip; avoid that burnt wood flavor sneaking in. Olive oil is favorite fat here, neutral enough yet aromatically suited for Mediterranean themes. Could substitute grapeseed oil but lose subtle fruity notes. Chicken thighs vs breasts? Thighs usually win for juiciness but breasts cook faster; mix gives balance for timing during grilling, especially if you want to feed a crowd. Chill chicken before marinating for a fresher flavor; room temp chicken tends to dry out when thrown on hot grills quickly. Timing for marinate minimal; spices cling better fresh. If pressed, dry rub with spices only moments before threading skewers. Helps texture — wet marinate can sometimes turn meat mushy if overdone."
instructionsNote: "Layering skewers demands patience; cram too much and heat won’t penetrate evenly, raw spots risk. Alternate protein and fat-heavy slices with olives to keep heat circulation and juices moving. Watch grill carefully; direct heat cooks fast, smell is key—no burnt bits allowed. If heat too high, outside chars before inside cooks. Adjust by raising quad heat to indirect zone earlier or lowering flames. Press meat gently with tongs; springs back when fibers close, signifies doneness. If still plump and squishy, wait longer, avoid stabbing with fork — juice loss. Finish over indirect heat preserves tenderness, mimics oven slow roast effect. Crucial step; skip it and chicken dries instantly. Resting is not optional even for small pieces; meat fibers relax, juices settle. Lemon wedges squirted on after resting provide sharp contrast, enhances all aromatics you just coaxed out on grill. Serving cold yogurt sauces adds texture contrast and cool relief. Clean grill grates post-cook while hot—scraper and brush, avoids buildup, helps next session. Wooden skewers? Use tongs to turn; piercing meat multiple times creates escape routes for juices, dry patches. Remember this when threading, only pierce once per piece if possible."
tips:
- "Layer skewers with chunks of chicken and slices of chorizo, alternate with olives. Don’t cram pieces tightly; heat needs to circulate or raw bits sneak in. Use metal or soaked wooden skewers; dry wood burns, bitter taste sneaks in smoke. Thread gently, avoid piercing meat multiple times to keep juices sealed in. Watch grill sounds; sizzling sharp, then softer means move to indirect heat. Time over flames varies—feel fibers firm up, spring back to touch. Colors shift pale pink to ivory, edges seared lightly."
- "Resting meat after grilling is crucial. Let skewers sit five minutes, juices redistribute. Skip resting and you lose moisture when cutting or biting. Use warm platter, cover loosely if needed. This quiet time changes bite—firmer but juicier. Skewers get more forgiving if you rushed initial cooking or your fire flamed unpredictably. Skewers cool quickly under fan or window, avoid chilling immediately. Rest room temp, no heat traps but not cold either."
- "Spices matter; cracked fennel seeds add crunch and anise aroma lost if powdered. Curry powder quantity nudged up on purpose; helps curry tie fennel, pepper, chorizo smoke. Use kosher salt, coarser grain; easier to control saltiness on meat chunks. If no chorizo, try smoked andouille or kielbasa for robust flavor variations. Each sausage type shifts overall spice balance; adjust curry/pepper accordingly. Olive oil is neutral base, could swap for grapeseed but lose subtle fruity hints."
- "Grill prep is key—clean grates, oil well to avoid sticking. Preheat high for sear, listen for telltale sizzles. Move skewers quickly once sear forms, avoid flames licking meat. High heat sears outsides; indirect zone slowly finishes cooking without drying. Use tongs gently, press chicken pieces to check doneness; feels firm yet with natural spring. If too soft or squishy, still raw. Thermometer reading 74°C (165°F) good backup but mostly rely on feel and sight."
- "Skewer handling tips: soak wooden skewers at least 30 minutes or burn risk and bitter smoke. Turn skewers with tongs, don’t stab meat repeatedly; juices escape through holes causing dryness. Alternate protein and fat slices to keep heat circulation balanced. Don’t overbunch olives or slices; too dense blocks heat, undercooks interior. Lemon wedges aren’t just garnish; squirt juice over hot meat after resting to brighten and cut fat. Serve creamy tzatziki or hummus on side for texture contrast and temperature balance."
faq:
- "q: How to know when chicken cubes are done? a: Press with tongs, springy but firm. Color changes pale pink to opaque ivory. If still soft, wait longer. Thermometer reads 74°C but don’t rely only on gadget. Sizzle and smell give clues too."
- "q: Can I use other sausages instead of chorizo? a: Yes, smoked andouille or kielbasa works. Different spices, adjust curry and pepper. Texture changes. Avoid too fine sausages that turn mushy on grill. Keep slices about half-inch thick for sear time."
- "q: What if skewers catch fire on grill? a: Move them immediately to indirect heat zone. Keep soaked skewers to prevent flare-ups. Oil grates well beforehand. Avoid heavy sugar-based marinades that drip and burn. Control flames with grill lid and flame height."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, fridge in airtight container. Reheat gently to avoid dryness, oven low temp or covered pan on stove. Skewers can be frozen but lose some texture on thaw. Use within 2-3 days for best texture. Avoid microwave for juicy bite."
