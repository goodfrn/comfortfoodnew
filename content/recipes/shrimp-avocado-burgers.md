ingredients:
- "175 g (⅜ lb) Nordic shrimp, thawed and roughly chopped"
- "1 small roasted red pepper, finely diced"
- "20 ml (1 ½ tbsp) light mayonnaise"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) harissa paste"
- "1 ripe avocado, diced"
- "4 brioche hamburger buns"
- "4 leaves of crisp romaine lettuce"
- "Mayonnaise for spreading"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat while prepping."
- "In a bowl, gently fold chopped shrimp with roasted red pepper, mayo, and harissa until almost combined but chunks remain visible; avoid overmixing — keeps texture intact."
- "Add diced avocado last; fold lightly to prevent browning. Season with salt and pepper just before assembling to avoid watering down."
- "Split buns and toast on skillet, both sides, until golden spots appear and edges crisp — about 2–3 minutes per side. Listen for the slight sizzle sound, signaling good caramelization."
- "Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise inside each bun to create a moisture barrier. Helps prevent soggy bread from the creamy filling."
- "Layer the bottom bun with a leaf of romaine lettuce; it acts as a crunch buffer and water trap."
- "Spoon generous amount of shrimp-avocado mixture over the lettuce, mound slightly, then top with the bun."
- "Serve immediately to preserve crunch; if waiting, wrap loosely in foil but expect slight bun softening."
- "Optional twist: add a squeeze of lemon or lime for brightness, or sprinkle smoked paprika on shrimp mix for a smoky kick."
introduction: "Shrimp burgers with avocado. Not your usual lands-and-burger situation. I learned fast that mixing stuff too vigorously muddies the texture — shrimp gotta stay chunky, juicy with a hint of sweet brine. Tossed the usual green bell pepper for roasted red pepper this time — deeper flavor, subtle sweetness. Mayonnaise and harissa bring creamy heat, but balance is everything; too much harissa overwhelms the delicate shrimp. Toasting buns? Mandatory. Skip it, and you get mushy disappointment. Crisp edges, tiny crackles when biting in — that’s how you know it’s done. Lettuce leaf under the shrimp mix stops bread from sucking up moisture — rookie mistake fixed. Don’t underestimate the avocado—adds creaminess but fragile too. Too early folding, avocado browns. Timing, guys. I add it last. Real talk, these burgers don’t need elaborate dressing. Simple, fresh, fast to assemble and faster to disappear when hungry guests show up."
ingredientsNote: "Shrimp: use thawed Nordic or other cold water shrimp to avoid rubbery chew. Rough chop them for texture; finely minced shrimp get pasty. Roasted red pepper swapped from green bell pepper for complex flavor and moisture control — fresh green bell works but shifts the profile. Mayo: light mayo keeps the fat in check, but any mayo works. Harissa: scale quantity to your spice tolerance or try smoked paprika for different heat. Avocado should be ripe yet firm — mushy avocado turns the whole mix into guacamole, which lacks structure. Buns: brioche recommended for buttery crispness; any sturdy sesame or potato roll works. Lettuce: crispy romaine guards the bread from sogginess and adds nice crunch; butter lettuce or iceberg could replace but watch water content. Salt and pepper last to avoid drawing out greens and avocado moisture too soon."
instructionsNote: "Heating the skillet before toasting ensures even golden crust without burning. Toast buns both sides until you hear slight crunch and see color spots, flipping carefully. Mayonnaise on the bun interior sets a moisture barrier preventing burger sogginess — learn from kitchen misfires. Mixing shrimp with mayo and harissa quickly but gently avoids mush. Add avocado diced last and fold in lightly — timing prevents unwanted browning and textural loss. Layer lettuce under shrimp for crunch and to keep bun dry. Assemble just before serving to keep textures intact. If prepping ahead, toast buns shortly before serving. Experiment with a squeeze of citrus or fresh herbs for added dimension. Overcooked shrimp becomes rubbery — barely warm through for best bite. Watch and listen: shrimp turns opaque, slightly firm but still tender. Don’t skip the crispy bun stage, it changes the whole experience."
tips:
- "Chop shrimp rough, not mushy. Keeps bite. Don’t mince or you’ll lose texture. Harissa paste quantity? Adjust by heat level. Too much clobbers shrimp delicate taste. Fold gently; overmix break chunks. Add avocado last. Browning’s instant with early mixing. Timing crucial for freshness and color."
- "Toast buns on skillet preheated medium. Listen for subtle sizzle, tiny crackles on surface. Golden spots appear randomly. Both sides, 2 to 3 minutes each. Crisp exterior stops moisture soak from filling. Apply mayo thin layer inside bun acts as moisture barrier; avoid soggy bread ruins crunch and bite."
- "Layer lettuce leaf on bottom bun to keep moisture away. Crunch buffer, extra water trap. Romaine preferred but butter or iceberg works if watching water content. Spread shrimp-avocado topping in a mound; don’t flatten. Keeps texture noticeable. Serve immediately for crunch retention or wrap loosely in foil if serving later."
- "Shrimp cooks fast. Watch for opaque color shift, slight firmness but no rubbery chew. Overcook and texture tanks. Use fresh or properly thawed frozen Nordic shrimp for best mouthfeel. Make sure heat isn’t too high or outside cooks too fast leaving cold center. Medium heat steady is key for even cooking."
- "Variations: Swap harissa with smoked paprika for milder smoky flavor. Green bell pepper works instead of roasted red pepper but changes moisture and flavor depth. Brioche buns preferred for buttery crunch, but sesame or potato rolls can replace. Fresh squeeze of lemon or lime brightens and adds acidity at serving."
faq:
- "q: Why fold shrimp gently? a: Keeps shrimp texture chunky. Overmixing breaks down pieces. Shrimp tastes better with chunks. Browning avocado happens fast if mixed early. Timing affects color and texture too."
- "q: How to avoid soggy buns? a: Toast buns first, both sides until crisp. Mayonnaise spread inside creates a moisture barrier. Lettuce leaf under shrimp mix adds protection from wet filling. Otherwise bread soaks excess sauce, ends mushy."
- "q: Can I prep burgers ahead? a: Toast buns and keep separate. Keep shrimp mix refrigerated, add avocado last right before assembling. Wrap buns loosely if needed but expect slight softening. Assemble close to serving time for best texture."
- "q: What if no harissa paste on hand? a: Use smoked paprika or a small amount of chili paste. Adjust quantity for heat preference. Mayonnaise still key for creamy texture. Avoid overpowering delicate shrimp with too much spice."
