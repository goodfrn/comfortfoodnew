slug: "asparagus-romesco-twist"
description: "Roasted red pepper romesco sauce paired with oven-roasted asparagus and scallions. Almonds replaced with hazelnuts for earthier crunch. Bread crumbs swapped for toasted quinoa for nuttiness and crunch. Touch of smoked chili flakes adds heat depth. Oven roasted peppers loose their skin easy when enclosed in warm airtight container immediately. Sauce blended until partly chunky keeps rustic texture alive. Asparagus roasted to tender but still firm, tossed mid roast for even caramelization. Simple salad dressing finish on scallions keeps brightness. Sauce doubles as dip or glaze."

ingredients:
- "=== Romesco Sauce ==="
- "2 red bell peppers, halved and seeded"
- "1 hot cherry pepper"
- "1/4 cup olive oil plus 1 tablespoon"
- "1 medium plum tomato, chopped"
- "1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts"
- "1 garlic clove, peeled"
- "1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1/8 teaspoon ground cumin"
- "3 tablespoons toasted quinoa"
- "2 teaspoons sherry vinegar"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
- "Small pinch smoked chili flakes (optional for more heat)"
- "=== Asparagus and Scallions ==="
- "1 1/2 pounds asparagus, trimmed"
- "1 bunch scallions, trimmed"
- "1 tablespoon olive oil"
- "Salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Romesco Sauce ==="
- "1 Preheat oven to 225 C (440 F) with rack in middle. Line baking sheet with parchment paper."
- "2 Place bell pepper halves skin side up and whole hot pepper on sheet. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, toss to coat. Roast about 30 minutes, peeling skin will bubble and start to char. Watch closely last 5 minutes, skin should blister black spots but not burn."
- "3 Transfer hot veggies to airtight container or bowl covered tightly with foil. Let sit 10-15 minutes. Steam loosens skins, easy peeling separates flesh from seeds and pepper membranes. Peel skins off carefully with fingers or paring knife."
- "4 In blender or food processor, roughly blend peppers, tomato, hazelnuts, garlic, smoked paprika, cumin, toasted quinoa, sherry vinegar, and remaining olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, optional chili flakes. Blend to semi-smooth but keep some texture. Sauce should look rustic, not puree."
- "=== Asparagus and Scallions ==="
- "5 On same baking sheet (wipe if needed), toss asparagus and scallions with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread evenly in one layer."
- "6 Roast 12-18 minutes turning halfway or when tips start to caramelize. Should be tender yet have snap when sliced. If thin spears watch closer."
- "7 Transfer asparagus and scallions to platter lined with half the romesco sauce. Arrange veggies on top, drizzle with remaining sauce on the side or spoon over."
- "Serve warm or room temp with grilled meats or as standalone starter."
introduction: "Charred red peppers releasing that smoky scent fill the kitchen, signals sauce soul forming. Swapped raw almonds with toasted hazelnuts last fall, added earthiness and woodsy crunch. Toasted quinoa swapped for stale bread crumbs, brings nutty crispness instead of pasty texture. Smoked chili flakes bring subtle heat, punch without overwhelm. Asparagus tricky, turn limp mush if unattended. Toss midway roasting, coax even caramelization, avoid grill scorch. Scallions roast sweet, still crisp edges; oil and salt unlock flavor. Sauce rustic, velvety, textured retains essence. Use leftovers as spread or dip. Steam peel peppers right after oven—key step for easy skin removal. Timing depends on oven quirks and pepper sweetness; sensory cues rule kitchen here."
ingredientsNote: "Choose firm red bell peppers; low moisture versions roast better, less watery sauce later. Hot pepper can be swapped for fresno or serrano if you crave different heat levels; adjust cautiously. Swap hazelnuts with walnuts or pecans, but hazelnuts offer a unique woodsy flavor worth trying. Toast quinoa dry until fragrant; critical step to achieve crunch without sog. Roma or plum tomatoes preferred — dense, sweet, less water content. Smoked paprika must be mild and flavorful to avoid bitterness. Cumin is subtle background earth; a pinch is enough. Sherry vinegar brings tang with a touch of sweetness; white vinegar too sharp, lemon juice too bright. Asparagus thickness dictates roast time — thin spears cook quicker. Scallions add freshness and sweetness; can swap for leeks or chives but texture changes. Olive oil preferably cold-pressed for flavor and smoke point balance."
instructionsNote: "Aim for blistered, blackened skin spots, not charred masses. Once roasted, enclose peppers in airtight container or foil to loosen skin — crucial step, makes peeling effortless. Peel carefully to avoid pith bitterness. Pulse blender ingredients gently to maintain rustic texture — over processing kills character. Toast quinoa before blending; crisp contrast essential. For asparagus, evenly spread out on sheet pan; overcrowding causes steaming, not roasting. Turn halfway through roasting to ensure even browning and softness. Salt timing affects texture; pre-salting draws moisture, which softens stalks prematurely. Serve sauce room temperature or chilled; warms flavor but preserves freshness. Sauce thickens in fridge — thin with olive oil or water when reusing. No microwave reheats; ruins aromatic oils. Learned patience from overcooked batches — lets ingredients sing naturally. Timing flexible, trust appearance and texture."
tips:
- "Roast peppers skin side up till blistered with black spots not burnt. Last 5 minutes watch close. Immediately enclosure traps steam to loosen skin. Peel carefully, pith bitterness if forced."
- "Toast quinoa dry on pan before blending. Adds crunch, avoids soggy sauce. Bread crumbs clump if damp; quinoa crisp bright contrast boosts texture."
- "Use firm, thick asparagus spears spread evenly on sheet pan. Crowding traps steam, makes limp veggies. Toss halfway to brown all sides evenly, avoid burnt tips."
- "Substitute hazelnuts with walnuts or pecans but expect altered flavor. Hazelnuts bring woodsy earthiness unique to sauce character. Smoked paprika mild preferred, avoids bitterness."
- "Scallions roast sweet but remain crisp on edges. Salt timing matters; pre-salting draws moisture, softens stalk. Finish with salt after roasting suits texture better."
faq:
- "q: How to peel peppers easily? a: Roast till skins blister then immediately cover airtight. Hot steam inside loosens skins fast. Peel gently with fingers or knife. Force peeling leads to bitter pith in sauce."
- "q: Can I swap hazelnuts for other nuts? a: Yes but flavor shifts. Walnuts or pecans work but lose woodsy notes. Toast nuts golden then cool before blending. Raw nuts flatten taste and texture."
- "q: What if asparagus gets mushy? a: Likely crowded pan or overcooked. Spread spears single layer. Roast 12-18 minutes max. Thin spears need less time. Toss halfway to brown evenly."
- "q: How to store leftover sauce? a: Fridge is best, thickens. Thin later with splash olive oil or water. Avoid microwaving; kills aroma and texture. Serve cold or room temp. Use within few days."
