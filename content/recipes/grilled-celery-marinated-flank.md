slug: "grilled-celery-marinated-flank"
description: "Beef flank marinated in a tangy, spicy mix with celery seeds, grilled alongside celery brushed with oil and balsamic. The marinade includes vegetable cocktail juice, soy sauce, and a hit of Tabasco. Celery grilled till al dente, caramelized edges, smoky but crisp. Flank steak seared hot with marinade reduced into a glossy sauce thickened by corn starch. Resting meat retains juices. Can swap cocktail juice for tomato juice or diluted V8. Perfectly charred celery holding firm, steak sliced thin, sauced generously. Robust, layered flavors, simple but clever. No nuts, no dairy, ideal for allergy-conscious with bold tastes."

ingredients:
- "=== Marinade ==="
- "170 ml (3/4 cup minus 1 tbsp) vegetable cocktail juice (or 1 small 150 ml can)"
- "28 ml (nearly 2 tbsp) soy sauce"
- "14 ml (just under 1 tbsp) Worcestershire sauce"
- "14 ml (1 tbsp) freshly squeezed lemon juice"
- "14 ml (1 tbsp) Tabasco or other hot sauce"
- "3 ml (scant 1/2 tsp) celery seeds"
- "=== Grilled Celery ==="
- "11 to 13 stalks celery (about 1 foot, check thickness)"
- "28 ml (2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "14 ml (1 tbsp) balsamic vinegar"
- "Salt and freshly cracked pepper"
- "=== Flank Steak ==="
- "650 g (1.4 lb) flank steak or bavette de boeuf"
- "8 ml (1.5 tsp) corn starch"
instructions:
- "=== Marinade ==="
- "1. Mix all marinade ingredients in a glass container or zip-top bag. Stir or shake to combine. Add beef, turning to coat thoroughly. Cover or seal; refrigerate at least 5 hours or overnight for best flavor penetration. Turn meat every now and then to redistribute marinade. The acidity and salt in the marinade soften fibers slowly, flavor seeps deep."
- "=== Grilled Celery ==="
- "2. Fire up the grill medium heat. Clean and oil grates well to prevent sticking — nobody likes shredded celery. While warming, coat celery stalks in a wide baking dish with olive oil and balsamic, season with salt and pepper. Let marinade help soften slightly while grill heats."
- "3. Grill celery around 14-18 minutes, flipping every 4-5 minutes. Look for slightly browned edges and firm but tender stalks, not mushy. Celery should retain crunch with sweet smoky char spots. Resist temptation to rush flipping – even color is key."
- "4. Remove celery to warm plate or sheet. Cover loosely with foil so it stays softening in residual heat without stewing."
- "=== Flank Steak ==="
- "5. Drain beef from marinade, reserve liquid for sauce. Pat meat dry to get a good sear — wet surface steams, no caramel. Toss corn starch on both sides to help sauce cling and thicken later. When grill is hot (high heat setting, grates glowing), lay steak down. You want that instant sizzle."
- "6. Cook meat about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, depending on thickness. Edges darken quickly, crust forms. Press lightly to test firmness; soft squeeze means rare, firmer means medium. Don’t poke with fork—juices escape. Remove steak, tent with foil. Rest 6 minutes minimum so juices redistribute, making each bite succulent, less bleeding on plate."
- "=== Sauce ==="
- "7. Pour reserved marinade into saucepan off the heat. Stir corn starch slurry (1 tsp in 1 tbsp cold water) into marinade. Bring to a boil, whisk steadily. Sauce will thicken quickly within 1-2 minutes. Taste it; add salt or pepper if marinade tastes flat or overspiced. The sauce holds marinade’s heat, acidity, salt, focusing flavors into a glossy coating."
- "8. Slice steak across the grain very thin. This matters — cross-grain cuts break meat fibers, tenderizing each bite. Arrange on plate, drizzle thickened sauce over. Serve with warm grilled celery alongside."
- "9. Serve immediately. If sauce thickens too much, stir in a splash of water or vegetable cocktail to loosen. Leftover marinade must be boiled due to raw beef contact, no shortcuts."
introduction: "Celery grilled, yes grilled. Not just an afterthought but the partner here. Crunchy, smoky, lightly tart with balsamic. Feel that snap when you bite in, the juice bursts. Meat, marinated thick with veggies, heat, acid. Not just dumped into a bag, but gently massaged, given time to mingle flavors overnight if you can. Then flash-seared hot, once, no flipping frenzy, to lock in juices and that crust that sings under your knife. Sauce made from marinade thickened gently, this is old-school flavor thinking — nothing wasted, all transformed. I’ve burned this sauce, watered down others, but with corn starch slurry and steady whisk, you get the glossy gloss that clings. The celery’s freshness cuts all that richness, balances the plate. Robust, rustic, no fuss, just smart."
ingredientsNote: "I often swap cocktail juice for tomato juice or watered down V8 when the former’s not on hand. Adds a subtle vegetal sweetness, sometimes a sour punch depending on brand. Celery seeds—tiny burst of anisey bitterness—can use ground celery salt as backup but flavor dims. Flank steak can be substituted for flank, skirt, even flat iron with similar results but adjust cooking times—thinner steak cooks faster. Corn starch is king here—don’t skip or sauce stays thin or gritty. Olive oil must be good, fruity. For balsamic, use aged but not syrupy cheap glaze; if missing, a squeeze lemon juice or splash red wine vinegar helps acidity. Adjust Tabasco to heat tolerance; sometimes smoked hot sauce gives a nice twist. Salt and pepper fresh ground—too early seasoning on meat wastes moisture, better to season after marinating."
instructionsNote: "Marinate overnight if possible. Long marinating makes meat tender, flavors richer. If short on time, even 4 hours helps but flavor less developed. When grilling celery, patience counts—flip slowly, hear the sizzle, see slight char—don’t rush or stalks shrivel. Dry beef very well before grilling; wetness kills crust and invites flare-ups. Corn starch on steak before grilling absorbs surface marinade and prevents burning. After grilling, always rest your meat; cutting too soon leaks juices and leaves dry, disappointing bites. Sauce needs constant whisking while boiling or lumps. If sauce starts too thick, dilute early; too thin, add tiny more starch slurry but remember it thickens as it cools. Slice steak very thin, across the grain. Presentation matters for texture and ease of eating—chunky cuts feel tough, thin ribbons melt with each chew. Hot plate, warm celery, glossy meat sauce—everything must arrive synchronized, so start marinade early and know your grill’s heat pattern. If no grill, skillet with cast iron and brush celery with oil works too but less char."
tips:
- "Marinate meat in glass or zip bag overnight if time lets. Acid in juice breaks fibers but slowly. Turn occasionally to spread flavor evenly. Pat meat dry before grilling to avoid steaming and soft crust. Corn starch dusted on steak locks sauce better when reheated."
- "Heat grill to high, oil grates well or celery sticks will tear apart on flip. Watch celery closley while grilling. Look for subtle browning and firm stalks that retain crunch. Slow flip every 4-5 minutes keeps even heat. Avoid rush, mushy celery kills texture contrast."
- "Use vegetable cocktail juice or tomato juice diluted to balance acidity. Switch balsamic vinegar with lemon juice or red wine vinegar if glaze unavailable; acidity helps caramelize celery without syrupy finish. Tabasco can be swapped for smoked hot sauce to add depth but adjust heat levels carefully."
- "Rest steak under foil minimum 6 minutes after grilling. Juices redistribute, texture compresses for less bleed on cutting board. Slicing thin and across grain crucial to break fibers. Chunky slices always tougher, chew fatigue sets in fast."
- "Sauce made by whisking cornstarch slurry into cooled marinade off-heat then boiling gently until thick. Too thick? Add water or more cocktail juice to loosen at serving. Constant whisking stops lumps. Cooling thickens sauce further, so err on thinner side before plating."
faq:
- "q: Can I shorten marinating time? a: Four hours workable but flavor and tenderizing less intense. Overnight recommended for better fiber break down. Acid needs time to work through meat layers. Skipping turns might lead to uneven taste."
- "q: Substitute for cocktail juice? a: Tomato juice diluted or watered down V8. Celery flavor dims a bit but acidity preserved. Lemon juice or vinegar addition balances missing vegetal note. Watch salt levels because juice varies in sodium content widely."
- "q: How to keep celery crisp? a: Oil grates, grill medium heat slow flips. Avoid crowding so air circulates. Brown edges are sign celery is roasting, not burning. Let celery rest on warm plate covered loosely so residual heat softens stalk without stewing."
- "q: What causes sauce lumps? a: Corn starch slurry not mixed well or liquid too hot when slurry added causes clumping. Cool marinade before whisking slurry in. Constant stirring during boil smooths sauce. Add slurry slowly if unsure. Too thick—thin with water or juice carefully."
