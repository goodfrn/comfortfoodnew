ingredients:
- "1 bunch rapinis about 370 g (13 oz), trimmed"
- "1 can 425 ml (15 oz) red kidney beans, rinsed and drained"
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) lemon juice"
- "40 ml (2 2/3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "4 chicken cutlets boneless skinless, sliced thinner halves"
- "4 ml (3/4 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "4 ml (3/4 tsp) fennel seeds crushed"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) crushed red pepper flakes"
- "3 medium Roma tomatoes quartered"
- "1 medium red onion sliced thin wedges"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "Small ball fresh mozzarella—optional replacement: crumbled feta"
instructions:
- "Bring salted water to a boil. Blanch rapinis for about 3 minutes until just tender-crisp. Immediately plunge into ice water bowl to stop cooking. Drain well, chop into 2-3 cm pieces."
- "In a salad bowl, toss chopped rapinis with kidney beans, 25 ml lemon juice, and 25 ml olive oil. Salt and pepper lightly. Set aside."
- "Preheat grill or grill pan on high heat. Brush grill with oil to avoid sticking."
- "In a separate bowl, mix chicken pieces thoroughly with remaining lemon juice (15 ml), olive oil (15 ml), smoked paprika, crushed fennel seeds, and red chili flakes. Salt and pepper. Let marinate for 7-10 minutes."
- "Toss tomatoes and onions with a brush of olive oil on a large plate, enough to coat but not drenched."
- "Grill chicken for about 5 minutes per side, until grill marks appear and juices run clear. Grill tomatoes and onions for 7-8 minutes, turning for slight charring and tenderness."
- "Add grilled tomatoes and onions to the rapini-bean mixture. Toss gently to combine flavors. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper."
- "Serve salad on a large platter accompanied by chicken grilled pieces. Add torn bocconcini or feta if using. Eat warm or at room temperature."
introduction: "Rapinis. Bitter, green, sturdy. Cut, blanched shortly — keep crunch. Beans mingle—red kidney, canned, quick rinse, drain. Chicken cut thin, sauced in smoky bites—paprika and fennel nuggets, spice flakes float in oil and lemon. Charred tomatoes and onions rounded out, softened in quick sizzle and heat. Salad held bright with citrus and olive oil coat. Optional cheese—bocconcini or feta, creamy contrast in mouthful. No gluten, no nuts, no eggs, only pure layered savory textures blending. Ready fast but mimics slow roasting feel. Practical. Packed with punch. Easy to grill and toss. Summer warmth in a plate. Flavors punchy, rustic, bold, fresh."
ingredientsNote: "Replace a full pound rapinis with about three-quarters pound — rapinis vary widely in bitterness and size so adjust amounts. Kidney beans down to 15 ounces to reduce heaviness. Swap bocconcini for crumbled feta for sharper dairy bite and saltiness also adding textural crumble. Paprika uses smoked to add deeper flavor notes distinct from the original's sweet. Reduce chili flakes slightly to keep heat fiery but approachable. Tomatoes and onions less in quantity but grilled longer for caramelization. Olive oil and lemon juice halved within the mixing components for balance so no single flavor dominates. Season carefully, rapinis can turn bitter if overcooked. Recipe now more compact, with bolder grilled and spice notes, keeping essentials while adding sharp tang and smoky fennel bite."
instructionsNote: "Start by blanching rapinis precisely 3 minutes — no mush, maintain bite. Ice bath crucial here to stop cooking fast. Beans rinse thoroughly to remove canned liquid taste and thicken salad texture. Mix beans and rapinis vigorously with citrus and oil but reserve some oil and lemon for chicken marinade. Preheat grill very hot, oil grid to reduce sticking. Coat chicken evenly with spices and marinade compound, then rest 7-10 minutes enough for absorption without slipping marinade off. Tomatoes and onions do well tossed with light oil only, grilled to soften and char 7-8 minutes, flip often to avoid burning but coax caramel sweetness. Grill chicken 5 minutes each side, watch carefully for doneness not dryness. Combine all salad components carefully to avoid crushing beans; seasoning adjusted last. Serve with soft cheese or omit, depends on mood. Temperature can be room or warm after grilling."
tips:
- "Blanch rapinis exactly 3 minutes—too long means bitter mush, too short remains tough. Ice bath stops cooking instantly—crucial to keep crunch and green color. Drain thoroughly so dressing doesn’t get watery. Size chop about 2-3 centimeters pieces for balance with beans and other salad bits."
- "Marinate chicken just 7 to 10 minutes tops—longer and texture shifts, meat gets mushy or dries out faster on grill. Mix smoked paprika, crushed fennel seeds, chili flakes evenly, coat every piece. Lemon juice and olive oil split from salad portion; keep flavors bright but not soaked. Grill hot, oil grill surface well to prevent sticking."
- "Grill tomatoes and onions till just tender with char marks, 7 to 8 minutes flipping often to prevent burning but coax caramelization. Using Roma tomatoes limits wateriness, thicker skins hold shape. Onions sliced thin wedges so soften fast, still present slight bite. Toss with only a brush of oil before grilling to avoid steaming."
- "Combine grilled veggies carefully with beans and rapinis to not crush kidney beans. Beans rinse well to lose canned flavor, add body not sogginess. Season lightly first then adjust last—rapinis can go bitter if oversalted or overcooked. Use remaining lemon juice and oil reserved from salad mix for marinade and final toss—keeps layers distinct."
- "Cheese optional — bocconcini for creamy softness or feta for tang and slight crumble. Add torn or crumbled on top just before serving to avoid melting or watering salad. Serve warm or room temperature; letting sit changes texture and melds flavors without losing crispness in greens. No gluten, nuts, eggs keeps this allergy-friendly and simple."
faq:
- "q: How to keep rapinis crisp in salad? a: Blanch for exactly three minutes. Ice bath right after. Drain well. Don’t over boil. Cuts bitterness. Chop after draining. Adds crunch not bitterness or mush."
- "q: Can I substitute chicken with another protein? a: Yes, grilled turkey cutlets or firm tofu work. Keep marinade same for flavor. Adjust grill time accordingly. Fish less suitable due to smokiness balance. Beans add heft so protein combos can vary."
- "q: Why are my grilled tomatoes soggy not charred? a: Oil coating too thick, grill too low heat, or not flipping enough. Roma tomatoes better for grilling. Pat dry before oil. High heat helps char without stewing. Flip often but carefully to keep shape."
- "q: How to store leftovers and reheat? a: Refrigerate in sealed container. Rapinis lose crunch cold, but salad still tasty. Reheat chicken and veggies separately on stove or grill pan, toss back just before serving. Avoid microwave; changes texture. Cheese best added fresh each time."
