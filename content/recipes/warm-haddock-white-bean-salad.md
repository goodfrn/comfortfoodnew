introduction: "Cold beans meets warm fish, no fuss. Haddock — flaky, mild — air fried. Brushed with lime oil, light, bright. Anchovies ground down, sharpness hidden in smooth beans. Shallots give a bit of crunch, garlic punches through. Smoked paprika twists smoky into the mix, sweet yet deep. Boston lettuce torn, crisp and fresh. Herbs chopped, mingling with mint replaced by tarragon — subtle anise. Citrus laces everything, lemon wedges squeezed at the table. Quick, clean, packed with protein and fibre. No gluten, lactose, eggs, nuts. Just air fryer and a bowl. Simple layers, textural pockets. Fork in. Fish flakes, beans smooth, lettuce crisp. Each bite different. Warm-white beans, zingy oil, herbal freshness. No leftovers here."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil and lime juice make the bright base. Using lime instead of lemon adds a zestier citrus note that pairs well with smoked paprika. Replace anchovy fillets with 12 ml anchovy paste — easier to dissolve evenly into the dressing. Smoked paprika takes the place of sweet paprika to add subtle smokiness and complexity. Boston lettuce stays for crunch and color, but swap mint for tarragon for a more aromatic herbal touch — tarragon’s anise flavor contrasts the fish smoothly. Shallots add mild sharpness and crunch; garlic boosts pungency with raw garlic providing a punch. Use canned white beans (navy or cannellini) drained well to soak the dressing. Measure herbs finely chopped and keep lemon wedges on hand so diners brighten the plate to taste."
instructionsNote: "Start by mixing the olive oil and lime juice, this citrus-oil base brightens both fish and beans. Reserve most of it for marinating the beans later. Brush the fish lightly with half this dressing, season simply with salt and pepper. Then cook in a preheated air fryer at a slightly higher 205°C for around 7 to 9 minutes, adjusting time for the thickness of your fillets. Flake the fish gently when done, keeping chunks intact for texture. Meanwhile, to the remaining dressing add minced anchovy paste (or chopped anchovy fillets), garlic, smoked paprika, shallots, and white beans. This blend marinates while the fish cooks, allowing flavors to marry. Build the salad bowls with torn Boston lettuce first — a base of fresh crunch. Spoon on the bean mixture, then add flaked haddock on top. Scatter the mixed herbs last for freshness and aroma. Serve with lemon wedges for optional acidity. Timing overlaps well — marinate beans as fish cooks to save time. Forks in."
tips:
- "Season the fish properly. Salt and pepper are basic, yes, but they elevate the flavor. Brush on the lime oil well. That helps too. Marinating beans adds plenty of flavor. Just time it right for the best taste. Smoked paprika gives depth. Heavy dose brings warmth to the dish."
- "Chop tarragon finely. It has a strong flavor. Too much can overpower. Mix it well with other herbs. Balance is key. Shallots and garlic add nice contrast. Shallots are milder. Garlic brings punch. Use both. Keep texture in mind. Crisp lettuce balances soft fish. Fresh contrasts."
- "Use canned beans for convenience. Rinse them well. Avoid too much liquid. You want a nice, absorbing texture. Flaked fish should stay chunky. Don’t tear too small. It needs to stand out in the salad. Layer ingredients thoughtfully. First the lettuce, then beans, fish on top."
- "A good vinaigrette improves the dish. Olive oil and lime juice are bright. Adjust ratios to taste. Preference matters here. Lemon wedges are optional at serving. Fresh squeeze can enhance flavors directly. Keep in mind acidity is vital. Balance it with the beans."
- "Timing is essential. Marinate beans while fish cooks. Saves on prep. Cook fish just enough. Don’t overdo it. Aim for flakiness. Timing overlaps perfectly."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen haddock? a: Yes frozen works fine too. Thaw first. Cook slightly longer though. Adjust air fryer time accordingly. Just ensure it flakes easily."
- "q: What if I don’t have lime? a: Substitute with lemon juice. Slightly different flavor but still good. Orange juice can work too. More sweetness though. Experiment and see what you like."
- "q: Can I make this ahead of time? a: Yes, partially prep. Beans can marinate earlier. Store separately. Fresh lettuce stays crisp longer if added just before eating. Keep fish for last."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Store in an airtight container in the fridge. Best within a day or two. Freshness fades quickly. Beans stay good longer than fish."
