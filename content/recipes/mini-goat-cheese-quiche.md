ingredients:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "1 1⁄4 cups all-purpose flour"
- "8 tablespoons cold unsalted butter cubed"
- "2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese"
- "3 tablespoons ice cold water divided"
- "=== Filling ==="
- "4 ounces goat cheese softened"
- "3 large eggs lightly beaten"
- "3 tablespoons pine nuts"
- "3 tablespoons sun dried tomatoes chopped"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
- "Chives chopped for garnish"
instructions:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "1. In stand mixer bowl fitted with paddle attachment beat flour and cold butter on low until coarse crumbs form. Add Parmesan then 2 tablespoons cold water. Mix briefly to bring dough together. Should feel dry not sticky. Add remaining tablespoon water only if too crumbly to hold."
- "2. Dump dough onto well floured counter. Shape quickly into ball then gently pat into ¾-inch thick disc, don’t overwork or warm it up. Some crumbling expected but patch as needed. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap. Chill 15 minutes minimum to firm up."
- "3. Divide dough into six equal parts. Roll each out in flour to about 2mm thickness, rough circles large enough to line mini tart pans or custard cups. Press dough into form using fingers, pushing into ridges to avoid air pockets. Trim excess dough around edges. Use scraps to patch holes. Dock bottoms with fork three times to prevent bubbles."
- "4. Pop lined shells in freezer 15 minutes to set shape. Preheat oven to 345F (175C) meanwhile."
- "5. Arrange chilled shells on baking sheet. Bake 12 minutes or until edges turn lightly golden and crust feels firm to touch but not brown. Thin crust means watch closely to avoid burning. Remove and cool slightly."
- "=== Filling ==="
- "6. In clean bowl, whip softened goat cheese with paddle or hand mixer until creamy and lumps mostly gone. Slowly mix in beaten eggs until just combined, slightly gloppy texture okay."
- "7. Spoon pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes evenly into each shell bottom. Ladle goat cheese mixture over the fillings filling shells to rim."
- "8. Sprinkle salt and pepper sparingly on top. Too much salt will overpower the delicate goat cheese. Less is more here."
- "9. Bake at 345F (175C) for 17-18 minutes. Look for filling to become spongy and set with slight jiggle in center. Edges may puff and crack slightly when done. Overbaking leads to dry crumbly filling."
- "10. Let quiches rest 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped chives and an extra sun dried tomato slice if desired. Serve warm not piping hot to avoid drying out fillings."
introduction: "Butter cold and firm beats warm butter every time when working pastry. Learned that the hard way—too soft and dough too greasy. Cheese in crust brings salt but sets texture to a crumbly base that won’t shrink too much. Pine nuts add a sweet crunch that contrasts the tang of goat cheese filling. Sun dried tomatoes packed with chewy umami fatigue after acidity when biting in. Rolling thin enough to crisp but not tear. Practice makes perfect—don’t panic if dough cracks patch with scraps. Timing is guidelines. Watch crust turn pale gold. Filling jiggle tells all. Chives always add that oniony brightness. Quiche not pretty at first, but flavor wins."
ingredientsNote: "Parmesan cheese gives crust natural saltiness and nutty depth. Could swap for Asiago, sharp cheddar, or omit for less intense. If goat cheese unavailable, feta or cream cheese mix works but changes texture and tang. Pine nuts can be replaced by toasted walnuts or pecans for earthier bite. Sun dried tomatoes in oil preferred for pliability but dry pack works after soaking. Butter must be cold to prevent greasy crumbly dough; chilling dough ensures easier rolling and less shrinkage. Flour type affects elasticity; all-purpose balanced for crispiness and handling. Eggs richness binds filling but too many make custard rubbery."
instructionsNote: "Mix flour and butter just until peas form—over mixing toughens crust. Adding cheese to dough adds flavor but watch moisture levels, that’s why water added sparingly—add more only if dough looks powdery and won’t hold together. Docking crust keeps bubbles from ruining surface. Freezing shells before baking sets shape, prevents slump. Bake till crust feels firm and edges lightly golden; the thinness means seconds matter. Goat cheese whipped with eggs slowly to avoid lumps. Filling texture should be custardy not runny or stiff. Pine nuts and tomatoes preloaded for texture contrast. Salt and pepper top but be light-handed; quiche can get salty fast. Look for slightly puffed surface, jiggle when shaken gently—perfect doneness signal. Resting after baking firms custard and melds flavors. Garnishes freshen and brighten the finished tarts."
tips:
- "Butter must be cold, firm. Soft butter ruins crumbly texture slightly greasy. Learned throwing away batches too warm. Chill dough after mixing; easier roll and less shrinkage. Roll thin but not paper thin 2mm ideal. Dust flour but not too much or tough crust. Dock bottoms with fork stops air bubbles, watch freeze shells before baking to hold form."
- "Whip goat cheese slow until creamy lumps mostly gone. Mixing beaten eggs too fast or all at once leads to runny or rubbery filling. Pine nuts toast lightly first for aroma but watch burn fast. Sun dried tomatoes: oil-packed better texture soak dry ones for chewiness. Salt lightly. Over salting kills subtle tang."
- "Crust baking time short 12 min at 345F until just golden edges firm. Thin crust browns fast watch closely. If edges brown early, tent foil shield center. Rest quiches 5 min after bake filling firms up, flavors meld. Serve warm never hot or chills fat and dries filling. Refrigerate leftovers tightly wrapped."
- "Prep shells day before, freeze wrapped freeze prevents dry crust. Roll dough between parchment to avoid sticking and tearing but less flaky. Handle dough fast, don’t overwork tough crust. If dough cracks patch with scraps squeezed gently. Rolling thickness vital; thick means under crisp, thin means fragile."
- "Baking temp steady 345F best for even bake; too hot crust burns edges raw center. Look for slight puff and jiggle center as done. Filling should be custard texture soft spongy not stiff or runny. Taste test: salt pepper sparing is key. Chives chopped fresh add bright onion note last step."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid crumbly crust? a: Cold butter key. Cut block butter small cubes freeze briefly. Don’t over mix flour and butter. Add water sparingly only if dough too dry. Chill dough minimum 15 minutes. Roll quickly, patch cracks with scraps. Dough texture slightly pea-size crumbs before water."
- "q: Can I replace goat cheese? a: Feta or cream cheese mix works but changes texture and tang. Feta saltier crumbly. Cream cheese smoother but less tang. Adjust salt in filling. Hard cheeses no good. Keep ratios or custard flips consistency."
- "q: Why filling cracks or sinks? a: Overbaking culprit mostly. Filling dries out cracks or shrinks. Bake 17-18 min at 345F watch jiggle center gently wobbles means done. Let rest to set. Underbake no good either runny. Bake time varies oven. Use visual clues not timer only."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Wrap airtight fridge up to 3 days. Reheat low oven 300F wrapped foil prevents drying. Can freeze fully cooled quiches tighten wrap slice thaw overnight fridge before reheating. Avoid microwave reheating toughens crust and filling rubbery."
