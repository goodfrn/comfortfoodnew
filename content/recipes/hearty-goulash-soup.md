ingredients:
- "2 pounds ground beef"
- "1 medium yellow onion diced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "6 cups beef stock"
- "1 can diced tomatoes 28 ounces, undrained"
- "1 can tomato puree 15 ounces"
- "1 tablespoon tomato paste"
- "1 cup frozen corn drained"
- "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "2 teaspoons smoked paprika"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt plus more"
- "½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper plus more"
- "1 ½ cups elbow macaroni"
- "1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese optional"
instructions:
- "Brown ground beef with onions in a large pot over medium heat until no pink remains; onions soften and smell sweet, about 6–7 minutes. Drain fat thoroughly to avoid greasy soup; too much oil makes broth slick and dulls flavor. Return beef and onions to pot over medium heat."
- "Add garlic, stir constantly. Listen for that sizzle and smell the garlic start to bloom in the fat—about 45 seconds to a minute only, no browning or it turns bitter."
- "Pour in beef stock. Stir to deglaze pot; scrape up browned bits stuck to the bottom—they carry depth. Add diced tomatoes with juice, tomato puree, and tomato paste. Stir to combine; tomato paste melds acidity, thickens broth subtly."
- "Toss in drained corn for bursts of sweet crunch that cut richness. Splash Worcestershire sauce—balances savory notes, adds umami that deepens slowly."
- "Add smoked paprika; gives smoky warmth, more aromatic than plain. Season with salt and pepper cautiously now—you can adjust later."
- "Bring soup to a rolling boil. Watch for big bubbles breaking the surface, swirling the pot for even heat distribution."
- "After boiling, stir in macaroni. Lower heat to a moderate simmer—you want gentle bubbles, not a furious boil which splatters and ruins pasta texture."
- "Cook uncovered for about 12 minutes; test the pasta texture often after 8 minutes. It should be tender with a bit of bite, no mush. Memorable bite means you’re done."
- "Taste broth—add salt and pepper bit by bit, adjusting depth. If too acidic, a pinch of sugar or honey calms it."
- "Serve hot, ladled into bowls, topped with cheddar if you want creamy dairy richness melding with spice. Fresh cracked pepper over cheese adds great contrast."
introduction: "Start thinking of goulash as more than just a one-pot beef stew. This version’s all about soup that hugs the soul and sticks to ribs without weighing you down. Ground beef browned with diced onions releases that familiar smell that shifts your kitchen vibe instantly. Garlic sizzle signals flavor coming alive. I’ve always added frozen corn—tried canned but lost texture—sweet pops are welcome. Worcestershire sauce not traditional but lifts the broth to another level, hint of tang and oakiness. Smoked paprika, not plain, because why not? The smoky aroma hits you early, tells you this ain’t your grandma’s bland goulash. Using tomato puree instead of the thicker sauce I find smoother consistency, better meld with stock. Pasta is all about timing; overcook and it disappears, undercook it feels raw. Trust your eyes and bite, not the clock. Adding cheddar cheese on top? Game changer in cold weather meals. Practical, hearty, familiar yet fresh shifts in flavor and texture. I keep a pinch of sugar handy to tame acidity whenever needed. Soup simmering on stove, house smells like my childhood in Budapest—invest in these moments, flavor develops in the smell."
ingredientsNote: "Ground beef can swap for ground turkey or chicken if you prefer lighter meat, but brown well for flavor. Yellow onions add sweetness; white onions okay but harsher taste. Fresh garlic preferred over powder—instant depth when it hits hot oil. Beef stock best homemade or low sodium boxed to control salt. Use canned diced tomatoes with juice to avoid watery broth; if too thin, drain half the liquid to concentrate flavor. Tomato puree is easier to stir in and mellows acid compared to tomato sauce. Frozen corn preferred—drain completely; canned corn makes broth cloudy and less fresh. Worcestershire sauce can be replaced by a little soy sauce plus a splash vinegar if unavailable—keeps umami in. Smoked paprika, not just regular—adds firewood aroma, subtle spice. Salt and pepper are entries, fine tune at end to avoid over-seasoning early. Elbow macaroni classic; can swap smaller pasta like ditalini, adjust cook time accordingly. Sharp cheddar cheese optional but adds creamy texture on finish—try other cheeses for twist like smoked gouda or pepper jack for heat."
instructionsNote: "Start by browning meat with onions—don’t rush or crowd pot; browning creates layers of flavor from Maillard reaction, more char more taste. Drain fat completely to avoid greasy final soup—too much ruins texture. Garlic must be added after meat browns to avoid burning; burning garlic tastes acrid and kills dish. Adding liquids and canned products after garlic cooks lets flavors knock together instead of stewing each separately. Bring to firm boil before adding pasta—this activates starches properly and prevents clumping. Lower heat to simmer once pasta in; too hot breaks pasta, makes it gluey and broth murky. Pasta done when tender but still toothsome—don’t trust time alone, taste test often. Stir occasionally to prevent pasta sticking bottom but not so much that you break pasta. Final seasoning step critical since flavors concentrate during simmering—adding salt too early can over-salt as broth reduces. Cheese on top melts gradually, adding richness and cooling spice right off the heat. If broth too thick after cooking, thin with splash of stock or water, then reintegrate heat briefly."
tips:
- "Brown beef and onions without rush. Don’t crowd pot; moisture traps steam. Wait for sizzle, smell that sweet softened onion. Drain fat fully or broth gets slick and dull. Fat sticks to surface and dull taste."
- "Add garlic after meat browns. Stir fast—burnt garlic equals acrid bitterness, kills whole dish. Listen for sizzle sound, watch color—not brown but blooming in fat, about 45 seconds."
- "Deglaze pot with beef stock; scrape browned bits stuck bottom. Those bits carry flavor depth. Add tomato products soon after to meld acidity with stock. Tomato paste thickens broth, use sparingly or broth gets gummy."
- "Drain frozen corn well to avoid watering down soup. Pops of sweet corn pop texture against rich beef. Using canned corn? Drain multiple times or broth comes cloudy, dulls freshness."
- "Bring soup to strong boil before adding pasta; starch activates under heat. Then simmer gently, too hot breaks pasta; gluey broth follows. Stir occasionally to stop sticking but not too much or pasta breaks."
faq:
- "q: Can ground turkey replace beef? a: Yes, swap easily. Brown well or meat stays bland. Turkey less fat so add oil or broth might dry. Flavor changes but good lean option, adjust seasoning."
- "q: How to fix soup if too watery? a: Reduce by simmer. Or drain some canned tomatoes first before adding. Can thicken with tomato paste slowly. Add less stock at start next time. Corn drains help too."
- "q: What if pasta overcooks? a: Stop cooking immediately. Drain and rinse with cold water to halt cooking. Add back to soup or serve separately. Use smaller pasta shapes and watch time closely to avoid mush."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Soup thickens overnight; add stock or water when reheating. Freeze in portions, thaw slowly. Cheese on top best added fresh per serving."
