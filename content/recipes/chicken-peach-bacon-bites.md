ingredients:
- "Marinade"
- "25 ml (1.5 tbsp) red wine vinegar"
- "20 ml (1.5 tbsp) olive oil"
- "25 ml (1.5 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "1 shallot, finely chopped"
- "Mini skewers"
- "5 boneless skinless chicken thighs, each cut into 5 pieces"
- "3 peaches, pitted and cut into 10 wedges each"
- "10 slices of bacon, cut in half"
- "24 large toothpicks soaked in water for 15 minutes"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Marinade"
- "Bring vinegar, oil, maple syrup, and shallot to a simmer in a small pot just until it bubbles. Remove from heat; cool slightly."
- "Skewers"
- "Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper. For each skewer, wrap a chunk of chicken and a peach wedge with half a slice of bacon. Secure with a soaked toothpick."
- "Place arranged skewers in a shallow glass baking dish. Spoon marinade over all, turning to coat. Cover and chill for 20 minutes."
- "Grill prep"
- "Preheat grill to high heat. Oil grill grates to prevent sticking."
- "Reduce heat to medium. Grill skewers about 6 minutes per side, turning carefully to brown bacon and seal in juices."
- "Move skewers to a cooler side of the grill for indirect cooking. Cover grill and cook another 15 minutes until chicken reaches safe internal temperature."
- "Remove from grill and rest a few minutes before serving."
introduction: "Chicken chunks. Peaches sliced thick. Bacon strips to wrap it all. Marinate quick in tangy red wine vinegar with sweet maple syrup and sharp shallots. Grill time. Gets smoky. Bacon crisps. Fruit softens but still firm. Chicken juicy inside. Bite-size. Crowd pleaser. Little fuss. Perfect for outdoor cookouts or casual entertaining. Skewered for easy serving. Each bite a burst. Sweet meets salty meets smoky. No gluten, dairy, eggs or nuts. A simple trio of ingredients but layered flavors."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken thighs hold moisture better than breasts, less dry after grilling. Peaches: ripe but firm, so they keep shape on skewers. Bacon -- not too thick so it wraps and crisps without burning. Marinade adjusted: swapped butter for olive oil and honey for maple syrup to deepen flavor and cut richness. White wine vinegar changed to red wine vinegar for sharper acidity. Shallots instead of green onion add subtle sweet bite. Soak toothpicks to prevent burning on grill. Less quantity adjustments to keep balance but trim excess sweetness and grease. Easy to source ingredients yet still elevate flavors with small changes."
instructionsNote: "Start with simmering marinade ingredients just briefly — too long burns off sweet notes. Marinade then cools before coating skewers to avoid cooking chicken prematurely. Wrap in bacon tight enough to stay but not smother fruit and meat; let bacon edges overlap slightly to crisp evenly. Grill on medium to avoid flare-ups from bacon fat. Flip carefully each 6 minutes until even color. Then indirect heat for slower cooking without char, ensuring chicken inside cooks fully but remains juicy. Resting after grilling lets juices redistribute. Toothpicks soaked ahead prevent burning or catching fire on grill. Serve warm to enjoy softness of peaches and smoky bacon crisp interplay."
tips:
- "Marinate chicken quickly. Don't overdo the simmering. Too long can burn off flavors. Use fresh peaches, rich but firm. Bacon must wrap tight. Overlapping edges for crispiness is key. Avoid thick bacon slices. Trim excess but don’t skimp!"
- "Grill on medium heat. Prevent flare-ups. Turn skewers carefully every 6 minutes. Get even browning and sealing of juices. Move to cooler grill for indirect cooking. Cooking slow ensures juicy chicken inside. Cover grill after moving."
- "Use soaked toothpicks. Prevent burning during grilling. Soak them for 15 minutes before starting. This matters. Can save from charred skewers. Arrange skewers in glass dish. Spoon marinade over, cover, chill."
- "Let skewers rest after grilling. Helps juices redistribute, better flavors in each bite. Serve warm. Enjoy the contrast. Crispy bacon versus soft peaches. Chicken must be juicy inside. Timing on grill matters."
- "Experiment with marinade. Adjust vinegar levels for acidity. Add herbs if desired for extra flavor. Use shallots properly. They add subtle notes. Use quality ingredients for best results. Maintain balance!"
faq:
- "q: How do I prevent bacon from burning? a: Grill on medium, not high. Flip carefully. Keep an eye on it. Move skewers away from direct flames."
- "q: Can I prepare these in advance? a: Yes! Marinate overnight. Grill the next day. Skewers last in fridge well. Just make sure to cover them up."
- "q: What if my chicken is dry after grilling? a: Check grill temp. Medium heat better. Indirect cooking ensures full inside. Let them rest!"
- "q: Can I substitute other meats? a: Yes, use pork or turkey. Adjust cooking times as needed. Just remember texture differences when grilling."
