title: "Warm Melty Chocolate Tart"
slug: "warm-melty-chocolate-tart"
description: "Rich chocolate filling on a tender, lightly sweet crust. Uses dark chocolate 65% instead of 70%, with evaporated milk replacing cream. Brown sugar swapped to coconut sugar. Slightly thinner crust and shorter bake times. Finished with a sprinkle of sea salt and a touch of chili powder for a kick. Ready in about an hour and 20 minutes. Serves 8 in a rectangular tart pan. A simple dessert, fancy enough for guests but relaxed enough for a weeknight treat."

ingredients:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "100 g all-purpose flour"
- "22 ml powdered sugar"
- "2 ml baking powder"
- "Pinch of salt"
- "75 g cold unsalted butter, cubed"
- "35 ml plain yogurt"
- "=== Chocolate Filling ==="
- "140 g chopped dark chocolate 65%"
- "130 ml evaporated milk"
- "90 g coconut sugar, lightly packed"
- "2 eggs"
- "25 ml all-purpose flour"
instructions:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "1. In a food processor, pulse together flour, powdered sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the cubed butter. Pulse until pea-sized lumps form. Drizzle in the yogurt. Pulse just until dough starts coming together. Don't overmix. Remove and press into a disc."
- "2. Flour work surface lightly. Roll dough out to about 40 x 15 cm (16 x 6 in), roughly 3 mm thick. Fit into a 35 x 10 cm (14 x 4 in) removable bottom tart pan. Trim edges. Prick the base with a fork. Chill 35 minutes."
- "3. Oven rack low. Preheat oven to 210°C (410°F)."
- "4. Bake crust for 12–17 minutes until golden and firm. Cool slightly."
- "=== Chocolate Filling ==="
- "5. Heat chopped dark chocolate and evaporated milk over a bain-marie or gently in microwave till melted and smooth. Off heat, whisk in coconut sugar until combined."
- "6. Whisk eggs into chocolate mixture until smooth, then fold in flour evenly."
- "7. Pour filling into baked crust. Bake 12–15 minutes. Edges set, center still slightly soft and wobbly."
- "8. Remove and let rest for 15 minutes. Optional sprinkle sea salt and a pinch of chili powder on top for savory twist."
- "9. Serve warm or just warmish. Goes well with bitter coffee or vanilla ice cream."
introduction: "Chocolate melting. Crispy base. Minimal fuss. Rich, slightly bitter 65% dark chocolate, smoother evaporated milk replacing thick cream. Coconut sugar swaps out for less processed sweet touch. A dash of chili powder after gives unexpected warmth. Tart rectangular shape, not round. Quick chill for dough. Shorter bake times ran, so edges firm but center jiggly. Oven hot, rack low to prevent bottom burning. Few ingredients, simple techniques, no eggs whisked separately or special tools. Just quick pulses in processor. That sugar dusted crust crumbly and just lightly sweet, contrasts softly against custardy chocolate. Makes eight slices. A quick dessert but feels special. Best served warm. Ice cream optional but maybe needed if rich. Room temperature degrades edges do. Balance of creamy, crisp, bittersweet and heat. Serve fast. Minimal leftovers. More than chocolate cake but less fussy than gateau."
ingredientsNote: "Flour measured for tender but sturdy base. Powdered sugar instead of granulated keeps texture delicate, subtle sweetness. Baking powder small pinch added to keep crust light, not dense. Butter kept cold, diced small, helps create pockets for flakiness when baked. Yogurt adds moisture but also tang, helps fold flour proteins gently. Dark chocolate 65% chosen over 70% for smoother, less intense bitterness. Evaporated milk replaces double cream; fewer calories, easier to melt, less heavy. Coconut sugar swaps brown because less processed and adds subtle caramel and smoky notes. Eggs used whole, bringing richness and structure. Flour added to filling thickens without toughening as much as cornstarch would. The chili powder and sea salt sprinkled at end deliver balance and surprise, not overpowering by any means. Adapt sugar or chocolate type as preferred but expect changes in texture and taste."
instructionsNote: "Dough pulses until it looks like coarse crumbs, no need for fully coming together. Hands form dough disc quickly to avoid warming butter too much. Roll carefully, dusting work surface to prevent stickiness, but too much flour will toughen crust. Dock (fork poke) holes prevent bubbling up. Chill important for gluten rest and easier transfer to pan. Preheat oven fully, rack position low helps bottom cook crisp. Bake crust until lightly golden but not dark brown, remove earlier if pan thinner or oven hotter. Chocolate melts gentle, do not scorch. Whisk sugar in off heat so it dissolves smoothly without grain. Eggs added slowly, mixing well to avoid scrambling. Bake after pouring filling until edges start to firm; center oscillates when jiggled but holds shape. Do not overbake or filling will be dry. Rest after bake allows filling to set further making slicing neater. Salt and chili best freshness just before serving. Serve warm, not hot or cold, flavors best then. Refrigerate leftover tightly wrapped to avoid drying crust but reheat gently to return texture."
tips:
- "Keep butter very cold and cubed small so dough pulses create pea-sized lumps. Avoid overmixing or dough gets tough. Pulse quickly. Press into disc and chill well before rolling to reduce stickiness. Don't add too much flour rolling or crust toughens. Dock base to stop bubbles. Use removable bottom pan for easy slicing and clean edges. Chill dough 35 minutes minimum for gluten rest and handling."
- "Bake crust on lower rack in hot oven at 210°C. Watch closely 12–17 minutes. Pull out when golden but not dark brown to avoid dry crust. If oven runs hot, shorten bake time. Crust should be firm enough to hold filling but not too crisp or burnt. Cooler rack position stops bottom burning. Allow slight cooling before filling pour so crust retains shape and texture."
- "Melt chocolate gently either double boiler or microwave in short bursts, stir frequently. Avoid scorching or grainy texture. Off heat, whisk sugar in slowly to dissolve coconut sugar fully. Add eggs gradually with constant mixing to prevent scrambling. Folding flour last keeps filling tender. Baking filling 12–15 minutes—edges firm, center jiggles—key for melty texture. Overbaking dries it out quickly needing watchful eye."
- "Finish tart warm or just warmish. Sprinkling fine sea salt and pinch of chili powder right before serving adds sharp contrast and unexpected warmth. Chili powder subtle not overpowering but adds depth. Salt sharpens chocolate notes. Serve with vanilla ice cream or bitter coffee to balance richness. Room temperature makes crust edges degrade texture fast; best eaten soon after resting."
- "Leftovers store wrapped tightly in fridge to maintain crust moisture without drying. Reheat gently; too hot ruins melty center and hardens edges. Avoid freezing unless sealed airtight—texture loss likely. Dough can be prepped ahead and chilled before baking. Dough integrity depends on cold butter and minimal handling. Rolling thin around 3 mm delivers tender but sturdy base lifting custardy filling."
faq:
- "q: Can I use cream instead of evaporated milk? a: Yes, cream richer, thicker; melts differently. May thicken chocolate more, change texture. Watch baking time; could need adjustment. Evaporated milk lighter but keeps melty feel. Swap changes calorie count too."
- "q: What if I don’t have coconut sugar? a: Brown sugar closest alternative; similar caramel notes but more processed. Granulated sugar possible but less flavor impact, might be sweeter. Adjust amount slightly, dissolve fully so texture smooth. Experiment but chocolate filling texture can shift."
- "q: Why is my tart crust tough or crumbly? a: Likely overmixed dough or butter warmed too much. Cold butter crucial for flaky pockets. Too much flour when rolling stiffens. Dough pulses just until holds but still crumbly. Chill dough before rolling. Don’t handle dough too long or mix beyond needed."
- "q: How to store leftovers best? a: Wrap tight with plastic or foil, refrigerate. Avoid dryness; crust vulnerable. Reheat gently in low oven or microwave short bursts to soften filling without toughening crust. Leftovers won’t keep well room temp — crust gets stale fast. Freezing not recommended for texture loss."
