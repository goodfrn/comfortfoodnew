ingredients:
- "5 hard boiled eggs"
- "45 ml mayonnaise"
- "45 ml shredded sharp cheddar cheese"
- "1 small shallot, finely chopped"
- "12 slices square white sandwich bread"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
- "=== Decoration ==="
- "100 ml mayonnaise"
- "100 ml finely chopped fresh herbs (dill, parsley, chives)"
instructions:
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "Start by roughly mashing the peeled eggs in a large bowl with a fork. Mix in the mayonnaise until creamy but still slightly chunky. Fold in shredded cheddar and chopped shallot. Season with salt and black pepper. Set aside."
- "Lay half the bread slices on a flat surface. Spread the egg mixture evenly over them. Cover with the remaining slices, pressing gently but firmly. Cut each sandwich diagonally into 4 triangles."
- "=== Garnishing ==="
- "Arrange the sandwich triangles closely on one or two serving platters. Spread the cut edges with a thin layer of mayonnaise. Press the mixed chopped herbs gently onto this surface for a fresh, bright finish."
- "Serve immediately or cover and chill for up to 2 hours before serving."
introduction: "Cold sandwiches, simple and no-fuss. Eggs mashed up creamy, mayo holding it together. Sharp cheddar swapped in, adds a bite compared to softer cheeses. Shallots bring a subtle punch versus green onion’s grassy hit. Herb mix trimmed to essentials—dill and parsley, skipping chervil for a bolder note. Quick prep, minimal tools, only a fork needed. Cut into neat points, easy for fingers, not messy. Perfect little bites. Mayonnaise spread on edges sticks herbs and adds extra moisture. Great for buffets or tea occasions. Cool, light, straightforward. Stacks of 24, enough for a party. Adapt and swap herbs as you like, always fresh is best. Bread kept square and soft, no crusts trimmed here for simplicity."
ingredientsNote: "Egg count altered down by one, mayonnaise reduced slightly for a less rich filling. Cheese swaps to sharp cheddar for a slightly tangy contrast. Shallots replace green onions—milder but more aromatic under heat. Herbs simplified to dill and parsley, green and fragrant, skipping chervil due to rarity in some kitchens. Mayonnaise used twice—to bind filling and later as a herb-adhesive for presentation. Bread uncrusted and standard white to maintain soft texture and neat cutting. Salt and pepper essential but added sparingly as cheddar and mayo already bring flavor. Herbs chopped finely, measured by volume, fresh is mandatory here or herbs will fade in dry mix. Scroll for suggested substitutions based on local availability—fennel fronds or basil can jazz it up."
instructionsNote: "Eggs must be cooked thoroughly, roughly 18 minutes boiling to firm yolks, then peeled while still warm for easier handling. Mash with fork just enough to break up but not purée into paste. Add mayo gradually to reach a creamy but slightly chunky texture, this takes about 2 minutes of mixing. Folding in cheese and shallots carefully to keep some texture contrast. Spread evenly but avoid clumping on bread; too thick makes cutting messy. Triangles cut diagonally, four points per sandwich slice for ideal finger food size. Lay out on platters before decorating. Thin layer of mayonnaise spread on cut edges holds chopped fresh herbs. Use fingertip pressure to adhere herbs firmly but don’t smudge or dislodge from fragile edges. Rest sandwiches chilled briefly if needed but serve shortly after herb application for best freshness. Timing is flexible —prepare filling first up to 3 hours ahead and assemble just before serving."
tips:
- "Eggs boiled 18 min hard. Peel warm for less shell bits. Mash with fork. Not puree. Keep chunks for texture. Add mayo slowly. Aim creamy but chunky. Takes about 2 minutes mixing. Fold in cheddar shredded fine. Shallots chopped tiny. Avoid big chunks to stop overpowering bites."
- "Spread egg mix evenly on bread. Don’t heap thick or cut will be messy. Press top bread firm but gentle. Make sure filling sticks but sandwich stays neat for slicing. Cut diagonally into 4 triangles per sandwich slice. Keeps finger food size. Use a sharp knife for clean edges, no squashing."
- "Herb coating needs fresh herbs. Dill and parsley mainly. Chop fine, volume over weight. Mix herbs into mayo well – this becomes glue for herb layer on sandwich edges. After cutting, spread mayo thin layer on exposed sides then press herbs. Don’t smear too much or herbs fall off later."
- "Chill sandwiches up to 2 hours max after garnish. Keeps fresh. Herbs lose brightness if too long. Assemble filling up to 3 hours ahead but build sandwiches last minute. Bread waits soft and moisture balanced. Too much mayo makes bread soggy when stored longer."
- "Shallots replaced green onion here. Milder, aromatic under heat but raw works for crunch and punch. Cheese goes sharp cheddar, swaps parm for bite. Herbs stripped to dill parsley for robust green pop. Swap fresh herbs with fennel fronds or basil for local twist. Bread standard white, easy to cut, no crusts trimmed for rustic look."
faq:
- "q: How long boil eggs? a: Around 18 minutes needed for firm yolks. Peel while warm less shells stuck. Cool then mash chunky. Not puree fine. Timing crucial for easy mashing."
- "q: Mayonnaise choices? a: Use regular mayo for binding and decoration. Light less rich can work, but affects creaminess. Mix mayo into eggs slowly not all at once. Mayonnaise on cut edges helps herbs stick."
- "q: Bread crusts or trimmed? a: No crust removal here. Soft white bread keeps structure. Crusts add chew but can mess neat triangles. Choose softer bread for easy cutting. Press firmly when sandwiching to avoid loose edges."
- "q: Can sandwiches be made ahead? a: Filling up to 3 hours before okay. Sandwiches better fresh for texture. Chill maximum 2 hours after garnish. Longer equals soggy bread and limp herbs. Store cold, covered to protect."
