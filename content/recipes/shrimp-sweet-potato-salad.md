ingredients:
- "400g peeled shrimp, tails removed"
- "2 medium sweet potatoes, cut into 2cm cubes"
- "1 small red onion, thinly sliced"
- "2 radishes, thinly sliced"
- "2 cups mixed salad greens"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1 teaspoon ground cumin"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "Zest and juice of 1 lemon"
- "1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Mix sweet potato cubes with 1 tablespoon olive oil, smoked paprika, cumin, salt and pepper. Spread evenly in the basket of air fryer. Set temperature to 180°C (355°F), cook for about 25-30 minutes. Shake basket every 10 minutes to brown evenly; watch edges brown and soften inside, poke with fork for tenderness."
- "While sweet potatoes cook, heat remaining olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and sauté 30 seconds until fragrant but not browned."
- "Add shrimp in a single layer, sprinkle salt and pepper. Sauté 2-3 minutes per side while stirring gently halfway. Shrimp will curl, turn pink, and deflate slightly when done—avoid overcooking or shrimps turn rubbery."
- "Combine shrimp, roasted sweet potatoes, thinly sliced red onion, radishes and salad greens in a large bowl."
- "Whisk lemon juice with lemon zest, a pinch of salt, pepper and a drizzle of olive oil to make dressing. Toss salad gently until everything is coated."
- "Add chopped parsley last for fresh herb aroma."
- "Taste and adjust vinegar or salt if dressing seems flat."
- "Serve immediately or chill slightly for 10 minutes to let flavors meld but keep potatoes crisp."
- "Leftover tip: Reheat sweet potatoes separately in toaster oven or air fryer quick burst to revive crispiness."
introduction: "Shrimp and sweet potatoes, air fried to a light crisp. I learned patience watching the sweet potatoes sizzle and brown, edges curling slightly—signals the right texture. My early tries flopped, potatoes either dry or mushy, shrimp turned tough. A little cumin, a bit of zest, and the radish crunch added dimension, not your usual bland salad. The fragrant garlic-laden shrimp frying, smelling up the kitchen. Quick changes I made: swapping sea salt for smoked paprika, swapping cucumber for radish, tossing in fresh herbs last minute, to keep zing. A light citrus dressing lifts it all rather than drowning. Less oil, more flavor. Trust your nose, your fingers. I always watch the sweet potatoes before timing. Crisp yet creamy inside."
ingredientsNote: "Sweet potatoes are rather forgiving but cut into uniform cubes for even cooking; bigger chunks mean longer in the air fryer and risk uneven browning. I replaced traditional cayenne with smoked paprika and cumin to ramp up earthiness and complexity without heat. Radishes swap cucumber—adds a peppery crunch and stress-tested well in last trial with greens ready from the day before. Garlic in the shrimp mustn’t burn; adding it first then shrimp immediately stops bitterness. Olive oil can be swapped for avocado or grapeseed oil for higher smoke points or if you want a lighter taste. Parsley is my go-to herb here over cilantro or basil since it pairs subtly but fresh. If you cannot get shrimp fresh, frozen works, thaw completely and pat dry or they steam instead of sear."
instructionsNote: "The air fryer timing is flexible; shake the basket every 10 minutes to get all sides caramelizing evenly. The sweet potato should feel tender when pierced yet have edges crisp enough to sound a slight crunch when bitten. This balance dictates doneness more than timers. Shrimp cooks very fast; overcooked shrimp chew like rubber. Watch for pink turning opaque and curling tightly. Adding garlic first flavors oil but stay alert so it doesn’t burn and ruin the pan. Toss everything swiftly while warm for the dressing to cling better; resting salad helps meld but don’t wait too long or potatoes soften. I like vinaigrettes with zest and fresh juice to brighten instead of bottled vinegar. Serve immediately or refrigerate briefly and re-crisp the potatoes by air frying for 3-4 minutes. Common fail: piling too many pieces, which steams rather than crisps the potatoes."
tips:
- "Cut sweet potatoes into uniform cubes around 2 cm. Uneven chunks cook poorly. Bigger sizes mean longer, risk mushy center or burnt edges. Shake basket often, at least twice during cooking. Look for edges crisping up to golden brown, texture checks by fork crucial. When times vary, rely on how it sounds—slight crackle signals done crisp. Don’t overload basket or steam replaces crisp; layer loosely."
- "Garlic cooks fast; add it before shrimp but watch closely. Browning ruins flavor, becomes bitter. Keep stove heat medium, swirl quickly then add shrimp immediately. Shrimp curls pink and opaque with slight give when pressed—overcook and they stiffen chewy like rubber bands. Timing 2-3 min per side, stirring midway. Dry shrimp thoroughly if thawed, moisture steams rather than sears."
- "Dressing: whisk lemon juice, zest, salt, pepper, drizzle olive oil last. Add herbs at end, parsley best for fresh punch without overpowering. Dressing sticks better if salad tossed warm, coats veggies smoother. If bland, extra pinch salt or splash vinegar tweaks brightness. Avoid bottled vinegar's industrial sharpness; fresh lemon better here. Resting salad can dull crisp potatoes, chill briefly only."
- "Substitutions: swap olive oil for avocado oil or grapeseed for higher smoke points to avoid bitter garlic flavor. Herbs can shift to cilantro or basil but parsley holds fresh aroma best. Frozen shrimp thaw fully, pat dry; prevents steaming. Sweet potatoes interchangeable with other root veg or canned chickpeas for texture shift. Radishes replace cucumber nicely for crunch and peppery edge but not watery."
- "Reheating leftovers requires care. Sweet potatoes lose crisp fast if microwaved or piled. Air fryer reheating for 3-4 min at 180°C revives crisp edges effectively without drying center. Avoid stacking pieces. Shrimp best eaten fresh; reheating tends to toughen. Salad components separate before storing if possible, redux mix and dress just before serving keeps texture longest."
faq:
- "q: How know when sweet potatoes are done? a: Crackle sound when biting. Fork pokes tender but edges crisp. Look for golden brown edges curling slight. Texture beats timer every time. Shake basket every 10 mins to brown evenly. Bigger chunks need longer, smaller crisp faster."
- "q: Can frozen shrimp be used? a: Yes but must thaw fully, pat dry well or steam instead of sear. Frozen shrimps pack moisture, browning suffers. Add them after garlic just finishes to avoid burning aroma. Stir gently, watch for pink color and firming. Overcook leads rubbery bites."
- "q: Why shrimps turn rubbery sometimes? a: Overcooking main cause. Heat too high or staying on pan too long tightens protein strands. Shrimp curls and opaqueness good doneness clues. Stir once midway for even heat. Garlic prep timing critical; burns mask shrimp flavor and ruin texture."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Separate components. Sweet potatoes air fried again quick burst avoids soggy mess. Store salad greens, onions, radishes separately fridge in airtight. Dressing can go separately too. Mix just before serving keeps crisp texture intact. Shrimp reheated tough, better cold or fresh."
