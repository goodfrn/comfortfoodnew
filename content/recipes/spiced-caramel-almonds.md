ingredients:
- "350 ml (1 1/2 cups) raw almonds unblanched"
- "175 ml (3/4 cup) brown sugar"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) coconut oil"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) ground cinnamon"
- "2 ml (1/2 tsp) chili powder"
- "100 ml (1/2 cup) sugar mixed with 2 ml (1/2 tsp) cinnamon for dusting (optional)"
instructions:
- "Heat large skillet on medium-high. Add almonds, brown sugar, maple syrup, coconut oil. Stir wooden spoon. Mix chili and 3 ml cinnamon in."
- "Cook 12-17 minutes until almonds fully coated and caramel syrup thickens. Watch closely, stir often to avoid burning."
- "Butter (or oil) foil. Pour almonds coated in caramel onto foil, spread single layer."
- "Let cool and harden about 10 minutes. Break chunks."
- "Optional: toss in cinnamon sugar mix for extra spice and sweetness."
- "Serve warm or at room temperature. Pairs well with hot black tea or herbal infusions."
introduction: "Nuts and sticky caramel meld with cinnamon heat and maple sweetness. Butter gone, coconut oil steps in. Brown sugar shadows white sugar, deeper flavor. Heat medium-high, caramel sings fast. Almonds roast, glisten sticky. Chill a bit, crack shards. Spice tang lingers from cinnamon, chili powder for subtle fire. Mix sweet and heat. Simple swap, big change."
ingredientsNote: "Almondsâ€”raw unblanched for toasty skin and crunch. Brown sugar makes caramel darker, more complex than white. Maple syrup adds woody sweetness. Coconut oil replaces butter, less dairy, slight tropical note. Cinnamon carries warmth; chili powder adds subtle heat, optional but recommended. Dusting mix: sugar and cinnamon, classic combo for final coating, optional but brings extra crunch and aroma. Quantities feathered down 30% from original. Measure carefully; caramel precise."
instructionsNote: "Skip rush. Medium-high heat, not sear. Stir often to prevent burning caramel sugars. Coconut oil melts swiftly, blends. Almonds toast inside caramel glaze. Spread quickly on oiled foil to prevent sticking, single layer helps cool evenly. Chill 10 golden minutes, caramel sets firm but not brittle. Break into uneven chunks for rustic appeal. Final dusting optional, adds texture contrast. Cooler than last version but richer flavor from swaps. Great for tea snacks or quick energy bites."
tips:
- "Use medium-high heat. Don't rush it. Caramel cooks quickly. Stir often. Burnt sugar isn't fun. Watch carefully. Almonds need attention. They toast and caramelize as you mix. Coconut oil blends fast, unlike butter. Come back to it and stir. You want a smooth, thick coat."
- "Spread caramel-coated nuts fast. Use oiled foil. Single layer is key here. Helps cool evenly. How long? About ten minutes. The texture changes. You want crunchy, not hard as brick. Break into pieces as soon as you can. But let them cool slightly first."
- "Dusting mix is optional. But sugar and cinnamon? Classic combo. Adds texture. Roll those chunks in it. Or sprinkle over top. That's an extra spice boost. Not necessary but enhances flavors. Sweetness and warm cinnamon aroma. Adds a nice crunch too."
- "Store in airtight containers. They stay fresh longer. Last for days. But keep them cool. Heat makes sticky caramel soft. Best enjoyed at room temp. Not overly cold. They lose flavor when cold. Perfect with tea, breakfast, or quick snacks."
- "Get creative with nut types. Cashews or pecans work too. Alter spices if you dare. Want more heat? Add cayenne. Prefer mild? Skip chili altogether. Balance sweetness and spice. Custom flavor fits your taste. Easy changes keep it interesting."
faq:
- "q: What if my caramel is too hard? a: Heat a bit to loosen. It can get stiff fast. Don't panic. Try adding a tiny amount of water to rehydrate. Stir well. It might take time, but it'll soften."
- "q: Can I use another oil? a: Yes, but results may vary. Olive oil changes flavor, not the best choice. Stick to mild oils for neutral taste. Grapeseed oil, sunflower oil are options."
- "q: How do I prevent sticking? a: Oil your foil well. Don't skip this. Also, use parchment paper as an alternative. It works too. But foil's nice for easy cleanup. Pop them off when cooled."
- "q: Can they last long? a: Yes, store well. They can last up to two weeks. But keep an eye on humidity. Store in a cool, dry place. Fridge? Not ideal; makes them chewy."
