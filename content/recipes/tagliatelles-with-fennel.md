ingredients:
- "90 g (1 3/4 cup) torn brioche pieces"
- "50 g (1/2 cup) chopped walnuts"
- "1 tsp fresh parmesan, grated plus extra to serve"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "2 small red shallots, thinly sliced"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "140 ml (1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp) dry white wine"
- "1 fennel bulb, thinly sliced with fronds finely chopped reserved for garnish"
- "40 g (3 tbsp) golden raisins"
- "1 tsp fennel seeds, lightly crushed"
- "1/4 tsp smoked paprika"
- "200 g tagliatelle pasta"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack center. Preheat oven 210°C (410°F). Line baking sheet with parchment."
- "Mix brioche, walnuts, parmesan, 25 ml olive oil, salt, pepper on tray. Bake 7-9 minutes or till golden but not too stiff. Remove, set aside to cool slightly."
- "Heat remaining 25 ml olive oil in large skillet medium heat. Add shallots and garlic; cook gently 3–4 minutes until soft but not brown."
- "Pour in white wine, simmer till reduced by half, about 4 minutes."
- "Add thin fennel slices, raisins, crushed fennel seeds, smoked paprika. Stir, cook 4–6 minutes till fennel is tender-crisp. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Meanwhile, boil salted water for pasta. Cook tagliatelle till al dente, about 8 minutes. Reserve 250 ml (1 cup) pasta water before draining."
- "Drain pasta, return to pot. Add fennel mixture and pasta water. Stir over low heat 1–2 minutes to coat pasta with sauce. Adjust salt and pepper."
- "Plate pasta, scatter crostini on top for crunch. Sprinkle chopped fennel fronds and extra parmesan. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Crunchy bits with soft pasta. Fennel sliced thin, smelling slightly sweet, barely softened. Raisins add occasional chewy bursts, a surprise bite. Nuts toasted, double nuttiness from walnuts. Brioche replacing regular bread gives crumbly richness, softer crunch. Wine bubbles down, vinegar tang, warming garlic and shallots slowly dancing in oil. Crackled fennel seeds deliver herbal notes. Smoked paprika adds a subtle unexpected depth against the gentle heat from chili flakes. Quick roast, not long before they brown. Fennel fronds fresh and green cut through richness. Pasta cooked just right, slippery, silky but firm. Sauce binds loosely; water from cooking adds glue without weight. Simple but with texture layers, fresh and roast, sweet and spicy moments living together. Nothing sits still, everything contrasts but works."
ingredientsNote: "Brioche chunks substitute typical rustic bread, softer, buttery crunch when toasted. Walnuts replace half the usual walnuts for texture, distinct flavor. Raisins picked golden for lighter sweetness. Smoked paprika brings warmth instead of just chili heat, balancing spice. Fennel seeds cracked in hand, not ground, maintain little bursts of aroma you catch mid-chew. Parmigiano-Reggiano is best, freshly grated makes better melt and topping. Shallots chosen over red onions for milder flavor, better blending in. White wine preferably dry and acidic to cut richness and bring depth. Olive oil split for roasting and cooking, helps texture vary between ingredients. The pasta brands best cooked al dente, usually taking 8 to 9 minutes."
instructionsNote: "Oven preheated and rack centered for even heat on crostini. Watch to prevent brioche burning; softer breads toast faster than rustic crumb. Heat oil medium, sweat shallots and garlic without color first, to gather sweetness. Wine reduced to concentration gives deeper flavor. Add fennel slices only after wine has cooked down to prevent sogginess, maintain crunch. Raisins and spices introduced together for integrated flavor. Pasta water reserved before draining helps sauce cling. Stirring pasta gently over low heat seals sauce with starch. Crostini added last, preserve crunch. Garnish with fennel fronds finely cut fresh for brightness right before serving. Timing slightly adjusted, crostini takes less time due to brioche. Combined steps keep workflow efficient, pasta timing coordinated with frying and baking."
tips:
- "Oven temp critical. Too hot, brioche burns quick. Keep an eye on color. Pull when light golden. Not too crisp, you want some softness. Adjust layers of crunch."
- "Use fresh parmesan if possible. Gives better melt and flavor. Don't skip this step. Other cheeses won't match. Grate fine, coats pasta effectively. Enhances overall taste."
- "Pasta cooking water essential. Reserve before draining. Starch from it helps sauce cling well. Add gradually, adjust thickness. Too quick drying? Keep some extra handy."
- "Manage steps wisely in cooking process. Start crostini early. Watch time closely, can dry out. Once out of oven, let cool before adding to pasta. Keep crunchy."
- "Fresh herbs matter. Fennel fronds give unique aroma. Add at end for burst of flavor. Avoid cooking them down. They lose vibrancy and texture easily. Brightness is key."
faq:
- "q: What can I swap for brioche? a: Use regular sourdough instead or crusty bread if unavailable. Keep it soft but crunch is needed. Avoid too hard types. They won’t deliver the right texture."
- "q: Can I use any pasta type? a: Tagliatelle preferred for this dish. But fettuccine or pappardelle can also work. Shapes matter; ensure they catch sauce detailing."
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Consume within two days. Reheat gently using remaining pasta water added. Might lose some texture, but better than waste."
- "q: Can I make this in advance? a: Prepare components separate. Store pasta, sauce, and crostini each sealed. Combine when ready to serve. Keeps freshness, retains critical crunch."
