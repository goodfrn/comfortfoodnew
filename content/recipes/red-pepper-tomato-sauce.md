ingredients:
- "1/3 cup finely chopped onion"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 large red bell pepper, chopped"
- "3 garlic cloves, minced"
- "1 tsp brown sugar"
- "1 tbsp sherry vinegar"
- "1 can 540 ml crushed tomatoes"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed pot. When oil shimmers, add onions. Listen for sizzle. Stir often. Brown gently until translucent and edges start to caramelize, about 7 minutes."
- "Add chopped red pepper, garlic, and brown sugar. Cook, stirring frequently, until peppers soften and the raw edge of garlic is gone. Should smell sweet and savory, not burnt, approximately 6 minutes."
- "Pour in sherry vinegar. Stir well. Let the mixture reduce almost dry, watching closely to prevent sticking. This part concentrates flavors; you want the pan nearly wiped clean before moving on."
- "Add crushed tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cover partially, lower heat. Simmer for 12 minutes until sauce thickens and deep red color sets in. Stir occasionally. Texture should be a balance between chunky and saucy."
- "Transfer mixture to a blender or use an immersion blender. Pulse until the sauce reaches a rustic purée consistency—some lumps OK, total smoothness not necessary. Return to pan and warm through. Adjust seasoning if needed."
- "Serve immediately or cool and store refrigerated in airtight container. Reheat gently. If sauce seems too acidic next day, a pinch of sugar or splash of olive oil calms it."
introduction: "Forget generic jarred sauces—the kind that drown simple tomatoes under mystery ounces of sugar and preservatives. Start with red bell peppers, plenty ripe, for a touch of sweetness that cuts the acid bite of canned tomatoes. Onions bring a base aromatics layer, garlic sharp and fragrant. Sugar ain't just sweet filler; it balances vinegar's tang. Sherry vinegar adds a complex twist over plain red wine vinegar. In my kitchen, small changes make worlds of difference—adjust quantities to match your pepper size or tomato brand. The sauce can thicken or thin per your patience; too thick? Splash water or broth on reheating. Ever scorched garlic? Reduce heat or add later, stir quickly. Small simplicity but big flavor."
ingredientsNote: "Onion should be finely diced for even softening without caramelizing too fast—impacts texture. Red peppers ripe, preferably the ones with deep red color, more sugars, no bitterness. Garlic minced finely, but timing is critical to avoid bitterness; some cooks add last minute. I prefer brown sugar; less sweet but deeper molasses notes, but white cane sugar works fine in pinch. Sherry vinegar elevates flavor depth—can substitute with apple cider vinegar but expect a mild flavor shift. Crushed tomatoes from quality cans, fewer seeds and thicker pulp yield a better sauce. Season lightly upfront as sauce thickens and flavors concentrate; adjust before serving. Olive oil must be good quality; cheap oil alters taste."
instructionsNote: "Watch the onions. Don’t rush; slow caramelization leads to natural sweetness, balances tomatoes. When tossing peppers and garlic, smell their aromas intensify—they soften and lose harshness after 5-6 minutes, key to mellow sauce. Reducing vinegar nearly dry extracts brightness without sharp bite. Stir often to avoid burning or sticking as sugars caramelize. Simmer with lid ajar lets liquid evaporate gradually but preserves sauce body. Blending is optional; rustic texture lets the sauce shine with character. If pureeing, pulse not grind to avoid thin soup. Taste and tweak—salt is king. Reheating solidifies flavors but beware scorching; use low heat and stir. Refrigerate in sealed jar up to 4 days. Freeze in portions for easy weeknight use. This is a forgiving sauce; play with timing and texture to personal taste."
tips:
- "Heat oil medium low first; listen for shimmering before onions hit pan. Stir often but gentle, edges caramelize not blacken. Smell onion sweetness shift; this is base flavor layering. Timing about 7 minutes but trust scent and color. Chopped fine helps soften evenly without drying or frying fast."
- "Add red pepper and garlic later to avoid bitter burnt notes. Garlic fine minced but can go last if heat too high. Brown sugar helps with sweet balance, melt it into softer peppers but don’t scorch. Stir frequently, peppers soften, no crunchy bits. Around 6 minutes but aromas guide you. Sweet meets savory here."
- "Pour in vinegar slowly, stir to coat evenly. Reduce almost dry. Watch pan closely to avoid stuck sugar or burn. This step sharpens brightness but mellow edges. Nearly wiping pan clean means sugars carmelize lightly, giving subtle depth. Don't skip stirring, smells shift quick. Prefer sherry vinegar but apple cider works if needed."
- "Add crushed tomatoes, salt, pepper now. Bring gentle simmer covered half way to save moisture but allow evaporation. Texture thickens, color deepens to red ruby. Stir occasionally; sauce should cling not run. Timing 12 minutes typical; watch surface for tiny bubbles and skin forming edges as cues. Rustic, chunky body preferred over soup."
- "Blend off heat; pulse not puree all. Rustic chunks add texture contrast, some lumps okay. Return to warm gently. Adjust salt last; acidity can punch hard so sugar or olive oil calms. Reheat low heat, stir. Thickens on cooling; add splash water or broth if too dense next day. Store airtight fridge up to 4 days or freeze portions."
faq:
- "q: Can I use red wine vinegar instead? a: Yes but flavor sharper, less sweet complexity. Sherry vinegar adds molasses notes. Apple cider vinegar softer alternative but expect mild flavor shift. Adjust sugar to balance."
- "q: How to avoid burnt garlic taste? a: Add minced garlic later in cooking or lower heat. Garlic burns fast, bitter if overheated. Stir quickly when added. Some add last minute after peppers soften; others use garlic powder if needed."
- "q: Sauce too acidic next day? a: Add pinch sugar or splash olive oil and reheat slowly. Sugar cuts acidity but not too much or sauce loses brightness. Olive oil adds silkiness and calms acid. Can dilute with water or broth if needed."
- "q: Storage and reheating tips? a: Keep refrigerated airtight jar up to 4 days; freeze in portions for months. Reheat low, stir often to prevent scorching. Sauce thickens as cools; add splash water or broth on reheating to loosen texture."
