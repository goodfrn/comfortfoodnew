title: "Braised Beef with Peppers and Cherry Tomatoes"
slug: "braised-beef-with-peppers"
description: "Hearty braised beef chunks simmered slowly with diced pancetta, onions, colorful bell peppers, and bursts of cherry tomatoes. Aromatics like garlic build layers. Wine and chicken broth create the braising liquid that softens meat until fork-tender. Finished with a peppery arugula garnish and served over mashed potatoes. Uses pancetta for richness; can swap with smoked bacon for a different depth. The dish stews low and slow, perfect for those patient afternoons when flavors meld and textures deepen. No gluten, dairy, nuts, or eggs here, keeping it straightforward and rustic."

ingredients:
- "1.1 kg boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 4 chunks"
- "25 ml olive oil"
- "100 g smoked bacon, diced (instead of pancetta)"
- "2 large onions, chopped"
- "2 bell peppers (red or yellow), seeded and diced"
- "8 garlic cloves, minced"
- "400 ml dry white wine"
- "400 ml chicken broth"
- "450 ml mixed red and yellow cherry tomatoes"
- "Arugula to garnish"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Arrange oven rack mid-level; preheat to 175 °C (350 °F)."
- "Heat olive oil in a heavy ovenproof pot over medium-high. Brown beef pieces well, turn till deep color forms. Season with salt and pepper. Remove meat, rest on plate."
- "Leave rendered fat. Add diced bacon; crisp until fat releases and edges turn golden. Toss in onions, peppers, and garlic. Sweat gently until onions soften, about 8 minutes. Avoid browning these too much; we want sweetness."
- "Nestle beef back in pot. Pour in wine and broth; bring liquid to a simmer on stove. Scrape bottom to lift any stuck bits—this builds flavor."
- "Cover pot tightly. Transfer to oven. Braise for approx 1 hr, check liquid occasionally. If evaporating too fast, add a splash of broth."
- "After hour one, add cherry tomatoes. Meat should start getting tender but not falling apart yet. Return covered to oven, continue braising about 55–65 minutes more. Check with fork; meat should break slightly but not turn mush."
- "Remove lid last 30 minutes. This step thickens sauce and intensifies aroma—listen for gentle boil and watch liquids reduce to velvety consistency."
- "Lift meat out; rest covered. Set pot on stove over medium heat. Reduce sauce more as needed, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Should coat spoon thickly but still pour."
- "Serve beef on creamy mashed potatoes or root veg mash. Spoon sauce over generously. Garnish with fresh arugula for bite and peppery contrast. The greens add lift to dense, braised flavors."
- "Tips: If you only have regular bacon, expect smokier notes. For wine, dry white works best—a fruity but crisp character helps balance richness here. Chicken broth can be swapped for beef stock but keep salt in check."
- "Watch meat closely near end—overcooking makes it stringy; undercooking leaves tough patches. Use fork stiffness as guide, not just time."
introduction: "Big chunks of beef. Heavy pot, hot oil. That satisfying sizzle as meat hits the pan. Brown all sides till you're nearly scared it's burning—that crust? Gold. Then pancetta—or swapped with smoky bacon lately for a twist—melting into melted onions and peppers, sweet garlic joining in. The kitchen fills with these aromas, a promise. Wine and broth splash in; bubbles rising, steam swirling. The oven waits. You do something else; stir your mind. An hour later, bright cherry tomatoes for fresh bursts in the soft stew. Another slow hour. Lid off; sauce thickens, aromas pop. Yes, the smell pulls you near. Served over creamy mash, peppered arugula adds sharpness. That texture contrast you didn't know you needed. A stew isn’t just stew. It’s seasoning patience with simple ingredients. Done right, it sings."
ingredientsNote: "Using a chuck roast cut into larger pieces helps stew evenly. Dicing meat too small risks drying out. I swapped pancetta for smoked bacon recently—adds richer background smoky notes without overpowering. For a gluten-free and diary-free meal, stick to olive oil and chicken broth; yet, if you prefer more richness, swap broth with beef stock but watch salt closely. Bell peppers bring sweetness and texture; red or yellow, your call. Cherry tomatoes are the final fresh pop—don’t substitute with canned unless desperate; the fresh burst is key late in the braise. Garlic is generous—adds that punch without bitterness when cooked slowly. Keep salt low early; you can always adjust at end. Avoid pre-seasoning the bacon or pancetta to control overall salt better. Arugula garnish isn’t optional—it adds peppery freshness and lifts the dish."
instructionsNote: "Importance of browning cannot be overstated—those Maillard reactions build the stew’s backbone. Take your time here. Too quick? Pale edges equal weak flavor. Then, onions and peppers gently sweated allow sweet notes without bitterness—don’t rush by cranking heat or drying them out. Adding liquids and bringing to simmer before placing in oven protects meat from toughening. Cover tightly to trap steam and tenderize. Midway, tomatoes go in—freshness preserving the final layer of flavor. Towards the end, removing lid concentrates liquids; watch closely as it can easily go from perfect velvety sauce to dry or scorched base. Always pull the meat when fork tender—not mushy—overcooking ruins texture. Let meat rest briefly before serving to redistribute juices. Serve over something creamy; I prefer mashed potatoes. Arugula isn’t just a garnish here; it cuts fat and adds vibrant bite, balancing the rich sauce. Always taste and tweak salt and pepper at end—never before."
tips:
- "Brown meat well. Don’t rush. That crust forms flavor base. Keep heat moderate-high, listen for steady sizzle not burning. Flip often. Rest meat before next step; retains juices."
- "Use smoked bacon not pancetta? Expect smokier notes. Crisp bacon fat well, but avoid bitter burnt bits. Render fat slowly. Toss veggies gently, sweat till soft but never brown. Sweetness depends on patient softening."
- "Don’t skip scraping pot after liquids go in. That stuck stuff at bottom—flavor booster. Stir to loosen bits before braise. Keeps sauce complex, not flat. Add broth sparingly if evaporation too quick, watch eye and nose cues."
- "Tomatoes go late in braise—fresh bursts, not mush. Wait till meat tender but intact. Lid off last half hour thickens sauce, catch gentle boil sounds; too loud means scorch risk. Stir carefully, sauce thickness should coat spoon but still pour."
- "Watch fork stiffness near end. Meat should yield with slight resistance. Overcooked equals stringy; undercooked tough. Rest covered meat after braise; redistribute juices. Arugula garnish cuts fat, brings green sharpness needed for heavy stew."
faq:
- "q: Can pancetta be swapped with bacon? a: Yes but smoky bacon changes profile. Crisp fat slower, watch salt. Pancetta softer, less smoky. More salt control needed with bacon. Try both once; different textures each."
- "q: How to know if beef is done braising? a: Fork test best. Meat breaks slightly not mush. Jiggle pieces to check softness. Time varies by chunk size, oven temp. If too tough, add broth, cover, more time. Too stringy? Overcooked easy here."
- "q: Can I use beef stock instead of chicken broth? a: Sure but beef stock more intense. Reduce added salt if stock rich. Chicken broth lighter, lets wine shine more. Beef stock adds body but hits salt faster. Taste test always after reduction."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: In airtight container fridge up to 3 days works. Sauce thickens cold, reheat gently, add splash broth to loosen. Can freeze; thaw slowly in fridge overnight. Reheat on stovetop best to preserve texture."
