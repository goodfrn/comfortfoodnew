title: "Costco Double Chocolate Muffins Remix"
slug: "costco-double-chocolate-muffins"
description: "Jumbo chocolate muffins with a thick, fudgy crumb. Cocoa powder swapped with Dutch-processed for deeper notes. Slight tweaks on sugar and butter amounts. Added cinnamon for warmth and subbed Greek yogurt for sour cream. Resting batter lets cocoa bloom, thick texture signals readiness. Baking starts hot then cools down for rise and moist centers. Muffin tops get extra chocolate chips, melty and glossy. Watch edges for just firming, toothpick with moist crumbs not raw batter. Common pitfalls: overmixing kills height; oven door flapping sinks centers. Muffins dense but airy if timing and texture observed. Slight espresso kick optional but worth it. Ideal for breakfast or snack, pairs with dark coffee or milk. Makes 6 jumbo or 9 large muffins. Experiment with chopped nuts or orange zest for extra punch."

ingredients:
- "1 3/4 cups all purpose flour"
- "1/3 cup Dutch-processed cocoa powder"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "3/4 teaspoon baking soda"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "3/4 teaspoon espresso powder, optional"
- "10 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup Greek yogurt, full fat (instead of sour cream)"
- "3/4 cup buttermilk"
- "1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (twist)"
- "extra chocolate chips for topping"
instructions:
- "===Preheat and Prep==="
- "Heat oven to 425 F. Line a 6-count jumbo muffin tray with liners or grease well. For smaller sizes, use regular muffin pan; batter yields 9 large muffins if divided differently."
- "===Combine Dry==="
- "In medium bowl, whisk flour, Dutch cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, salt, espresso powder if using, and cinnamon. Mix well to ensure even leavening and spice distribution."
- "===Mix Butter and Sugar==="
- "In large bowl, whisk melted butter with sugar until combined but still slightly grainy. Cooling butter prevents scrambling eggs next."
- "===Add Wet Ingredients==="
- "Crack in eggs one by one, whisking thoroughly after each. Stir in vanilla. Fold in Greek yogurt and buttermilk—adds tang and moisture unlike sour cream’s thicker texture. Whisk until uniform but not aerated too much."
- "===Fold in Dry and Chips==="
- "Gently fold dry ingredients into wet. Avoid overmixing or you’ll tighten gluten, dense crumb. Batter thick, nearly like brownie dough. Fold in 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips now, hold rest for topping."
- "===Rest Batter==="
- "Let sit at room temp 10 to 15 minutes. Allows cocoa to hydrate fully, flavors deepen. Also thickens batter, good sign before baking."
- "===Fill Muffin Pan and Top==="
- "Scoop batter equally into jumbo liners—don’t overfill. If batter nears rim, better to make couple of smaller muffins alongside. Top with remaining chocolate chips for melty, shiny crowns."
- "===Bake==="
- "Slide in oven at 425 F for 5 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 F without opening door. Bake 19 to 25 minutes more. Smells rich with chocolate and buttery warmth. Edges firm slightly, tops domed and cracking gently. Use toothpick test: moist crumbs but no raw batter stuck. Don’t overbake or muffins dry out; underbaking means gummy centers."
- "===Cool and Serve==="
- "Let muffins rest in pan for 5 minutes—structure sets. Warm chocolate chips shiny and soft. Remove to rack if you want crust to firm more. Great warm or at room temperature with coffee or milk."
introduction: "Jumping straight in—baking muffins ain’t foolproof. Tried countless variations to nail these Costco-inspired double chocolate beasts. What stands out is batter texture—thick like brownie batter but pliant. Resting batter is key; coppery cocoa notes bloom, thickening tells you when ready. Oven temp dance—starting hot, dropping lower—makes rise sharp then steady, avoids sunken middles. Use Dutch-processed cocoa if you want richer chocolate flavor, plus cinnamon adds unexpected warmth. Swapped Greek yogurt for sour cream for texture shift, tang plays well with bittersweet cocoa. And don’t underestimate the power of extra chips on top, melty dots that seduce before first bite. Gotta listen to batter and muffin cues more than clock. Crackly tops that smell buttery cocoa, toothpick test just right with clingy crumbs—not dry, not wet. This ain’t dainty cupcake muffins, but fudgy, dense, tender morsels for proper chocolate cravings."
ingredientsNote: "Dutch-processed cocoa powder works better than natural cocoa for deeper, rounder chocolate flavor and better rise. Can swap unsalted butter with browned butter for a nutty aroma but cool it down enough so eggs don’t scramble. Greek yogurt brings tang plus moisture, substitute full sour cream if preferred—consistency slightly thicker. Buttermilk essential for tender crumb; if no buttermilk, use milk plus teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar, let sit 5 min. Espresso powder optional but subtly intensifies cocoa without coffee taste. Sugar reduced slightly from original for balance but you can increase or swap with brown sugar for moistness and deeper notes. Chocolate chips: split batches prevents sinking, extra on top melts glossy and visually appealing. Cinnamon is my twist, adds warmth without competing with chocolate. Standard muffin liners or nonstick spray works; for no liners, grease well."
instructionsNote: "Never dump dry into wet all at once—that risks lumps and unevenly mixed leavening, fold gently but thoroughly. Whisking sugar and melted butter first helps distribute fat and sweet particles evenly, aids rise. Adding eggs one at a time lets batter emulsify properly, avoids curdling. Resting batter 10-15 minutes crucial for cocoa hydration and batter thickening; gives better texture versus baking immediately. Avoid overmixing after adding flour—grab spatula, fold slow and gentle, you want some lumps, not paste. Jumbo muffin pans vary—keep eye on batter levels; don’t overfill or spill. Start oven hot for initial lift, then lower temp to finish baking gently for moist crumb and no cracking tops. Opening the oven door releases heat and causes centers to sink—patience is your friend here. Use the toothpick test with moist crumbs, not fully dry or raw batter. Cooling a few minutes in pan helps muffins set before handling, prevents crumbling. Leftovers store well wrapped at room temp or freeze wrapped individually."
tips:
- "Heat oven first at 425 F for quick oven spring. Don’t open door first 5 minutes. Drop to 350 F after to slow finish. Watch muffin domes—edges firm, tops crack gently. Toothpick test with moist crumbs not raw batter or dry. Oven temp dance avoids sunken middles, timing is key."
- "Fold dry into wet slowly. Never dump all dry at once. Overmixing tightens gluten, kills fluffiness. Some lumps okay; batter thick, brownie-dough texture. Fold in chips gently here. Rest batter 10-15 mins at room temp helps cocoa hydrate, thickens. Gives depth to chocolate flavor and better texture."
- "Butter melted and cooled before sugar whisking, keeps eggs from scrambling on addition. Eggs cracked in one at a time, whisk after each for emulsification. Greek yogurt substitutes sour cream well, adds tang and moisture but lighter texture. Use buttermilk for tender crumb. No buttermilk? Milk plus lemon juice works, sits 5 min minimum."
- "Extra chocolate chips on top melt glossy with bake heat, more visual appeal and fudgy pockets. For liners use standard jumbo muffin cups, grease well if no liners. Batter levels matter—don’t overfill, spills happen. Consider making some smaller muffins if batter is close to rim, less risk overflows. Cinnamon twist subtle, warm but not overpowering."
- "Avoid opening oven door during bake or centers sink suddenly. Baking time 19-25 minutes after initial high heat. Muffins still soft inside when edges firm. Cooling 5 minutes in pan sets structure, chocolate chips stay soft and shiny. Move to rack for more crust firmness. Muffins dense but airy only if mixing and timing followed closely."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap Greek yogurt for sour cream? a: Yes. Sour cream thicker, tang heavier. Yogurt lighter, still moist. Texture changes slightly but close. Use full fat always. If none, plain yogurt works but thinner. Also affects crumb a bit."
- "q: How to avoid sunken muffin centers? a: Don’t open oven door first 20 minutes. Start hot then reduce temp. Batter thick enough. Don’t overmix. Overfilled pans and rapid temp changes cause sunken middles. Use toothpick test to check doneness carefully."
- "q: What if I don’t have Dutch-processed cocoa? a: Can use natural cocoa. Flavor slightly sharper, rise less consistent. Add pinch baking soda if natural used. Adjust sugar maybe. Dutch cocoa richer, smoother. Espresso powder optional but helps deepen overall chocolate note."
- "q: How to store muffins best? a: Wrapped at room temp a day or two okay. For longer, freeze individually wrapped. Defrost at room temp or microwave briefly. Refrigerating dries muffins out faster. If freezing, use airtight container or bag. Thaw completely before eating."
