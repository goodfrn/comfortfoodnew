ingredients:
- "400 g spaghetti (slightly more than 3/4 lb)"
- "400 g large raw shrimp peeled and patted dry"
- "50 ml olive oil (3 1/2 tbsp)"
- "1 medium yellow onion thinly sliced"
- "1/2 ml crushed red pepper flakes (about 1/8 tsp)"
- "20 g pine nuts (heaped 1/8 cup)"
- "3 cloves garlic finely minced"
- "150 ml dry white wine"
- "160 g cherry tomatoes halved"
- "60 g sun-dried tomatoes in oil drained and finely chopped"
- "1 small avocado mashed (replacement for sun-dried tomato pesto)"
- "80 g Parmesan cheese freshly grated"
- "15 g fresh basil finely chopped"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat large pot salted heavily. Boil pasta just shy of firm bite – al dente. Drain well, toss with a drizzle olive oil to prevent sticking, toss and cover."
- "Meanwhile, heat large skillet over high heat, swirl in half olive oil. When shimmering, drop shrimp flat, sear 1 1/2 minutes each side until pink edges curled and opaque center. Remove shrimp promptly to plate, season lightly with salt and pepper."
- "Add remaining olive oil to skillet, reduce heat to medium high. Toss in sliced onion with crushed red pepper. Sauté until translucent, edges begin to caramelize — smell should shift from sharp to sweet, 4-5 minutes."
- "Dump in pine nuts, stir quickly to lightly toast (watch, they brown fast). Throw in garlic – cook 30 seconds or until fragrant but not browned."
- "Deglaze pan with white wine, scraping up browned bits. Let wine reduce, fizzing shrink, about 3 minutes."
- "Stir in cherry tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, follow with seared shrimp. Simmer gently, just long enough for tomato skins to loosen, 2 minutes."
- "Turn off heat, swirl in mashed avocado slowly to integrate creamy element. Season the sauce again now, salt and pepper to sharpen flavors."
- "Add pasta back to skillet, fold through sauce with tongs or two forks. Warm pasta until hot through, glossy coating all strands. Taste; add more salt or some red pepper if needed. Avoid overcooking pasta in sauce here — keep al dente."
- "Serve immediately into shallow bowls, generous sprinkle Parmesan, scatter basil leaves on top for color and punch."
- "Pro tip: If no sun-dried tomatoes, use Kalamata olives chopped fine. Shake pine nuts in dry pan ahead to quick-toast, brings flavor alive. If shrimp are wild and tough, add a squeeze lemon at end to brighten."
- "Watch pasta water closely; save a ladle before draining. If sauce too thick, splash reserved pasta water for silkiness. Avoid drowning dish. The garlic must never burn; burnt bitter garlic kills everything good."
- "Every step smells different, rely on aroma shifts. Onion sweetness melts into wine acidity; shrimp pop up juicy pink."
- "Count seconds on shrimp searing; overcook and they shrink, rubbery disaster. Precision here saves texture."
introduction: "Started messing with shrimp pasta long ago. Variations endless but found a rhythm. Pork fat or butter? Nope, olive oil keeps it clean and bright. Mashing avocado in place of some oily sun-dried tomato paste adds cream without heaviness, less sharp than pure pesto. Shrimp need drying well before hitting hot pan – moisture kills sear, dangers of steaming start here. Got tired of rubbery bites so timing got tweaked. Onions caramelized just right— not raw, not burnt— give deep savory notes with heat from pepper flakes. White wine to deglaze, highlights the fond stuck to pan bottom, bitter burnt bits avoided. Tossing pasta underdone ensures it finishes cooking mixed with sauce, not mushy mess. Finished with fresh basil and sharp Parmesan. Simple swaps can shift dish from heavy to bright, something I always chase."
ingredientsNote: "Pine nuts can be swapped for toasted walnuts if allergy or budget constraints hit; walnuts give nuttier earthiness but toast carefully or burn. Fresh basil preferably; if unavailable, flat-leaf parsley works but flavor differs drastically. Using avocado here replaces complex tomato pesto for cream and freshness—diet-friendly, lighter mouthfeel, good for summer versions. Sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil add richness and tang, dried alone need rehydration in warm water or wine. Garlic amount adjustable; more garlic increases pungency but watch burning point. White wine dry, semi-dry no sugar; vermouth or sake milder substitutes if unavailable. Use fresh shrimp for best texture, frozen can be fine if fully thawed and dried. Olive oil quantity can vary; aim for enough to slick shrimp and build flavor base but avoid oily final product."
instructionsNote: "Cooking shrimp fast and hot seals juices, creating crust and flavor. Pat your shrimp dry thoroughly; dampness is enemy to sear. Onion caramelization needs patient stir and moderate heat, watch edges for even color — no black spots. Pine nuts toasted till golden release sweet aroma, a signal not to step away or you'll get bitterness. Garlic introduced late prevents burning but lets flavor bloom in fat. Deglazing with wine brightens stuck pan bits, cut acidity balances tomato sweetness. Simmer tomatoes and shrimp briefly to meld without breaking down tomatoes to mush. Adding pasta into sauce at end finishes cooking and integrates starch for sauce slickness. Toss gently with tongs; rough stirring breaks pasta. Check seasoning last minute, acid or salt often needed to bring harmony. Garnish adds fresh herbal punch and sharp cheese hits salty umami spot. Use reserved pasta water if needed to loosen sauce; adds cohesion without adding fat. Timing slight adjustments by watching color, smell, feel over guesswork is key."
tips:
- "Shrimp must be dried well before hitting hot oil—moisture kills sear and leads to steaming. Pat thoroughly with paper towels; look for dry surface. High heat, quick sear; watch color shift from translucent to pink. Count seconds carefully to avoid rubbery texture. Timing saves all."
- "Onion caramelization happens slow, medium-high heat best. Edges start to brown, aroma changes from sharp to sweet. Keep stirring, no blackened spots. That smell tells you sugars are developing, adds depth without bitter tones. Never rush this step."
- "Toast pine nuts dry pan, quick and watch closely. They brown fast, a golden surface releases nutty aroma. Step away too soon and bitter burnt flavor wrecks the dish. Make small batches. If allergic or budget tight, walnuts toasted low temp work but flavor shifts earthier, a different note entirely."
- "Garlic added late, low heat. Smoke point low, so burning ruins flavor, turns bitter. Cook until fragrant only. Use finely minced garlic so it releases flavor immediately without long cooking. Onions and pine nuts provide foundation, garlic blossoms last minute in oil, no overcook."
- "Deglaze pan with dry white wine; acidity cuts fat, brightens sauce. Pour in and scrape up fond gently. Watch wine bubble and reduce until faint fizz stops, roughly three minutes. Adds sharp brightness to softened onions and toasted nuts. Sub scallion or vermouth if no wine; sake milder but less acid punch."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid rubbery shrimp? a: Dry well. High heat sear short time each side. Count seconds; overcook they shrink rubbery. Remove at pink edges curled opaque center. No steam, only sear."
- "q: Can pine nuts be replaced? a: Yes, walnuts toasted give nuttier earthier flavor but toast slower or burn. Almonds less oily but less crumbly texture. Risk burnt bitterness steps up with other nuts. Toast carefully, smell your pan often."
- "q: What if no sun-dried tomatoes? a: Kalamata olives chopped fine work. They add sharp salty tang. Alternatively, dried tomatoes soaked in warm water or wine rehydrate but lose oil richness. Adjust salt after tasting, olives saltier usual."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep pasta separate if possible; sauce thickens in fridge. Reheat gently with splash pasta water to loosen. Store airtight; shrimp best eaten same day but ok next day cold in fridge. Avoid microwaving on high or shrimp toughens."
