ingredients:
- "1 lb chicken thighs cut bite sized or strips"
- "2 Tbsp olive oil divided"
- "1 tsp salt divided"
- "1/2 tsp black pepper divided"
- "1 large onion sliced"
- "3 bell peppers assorted colors sliced"
- "1 Tbsp fajita seasoning"
- "2 garlic cloves minced"
- "1 can (14 oz) diced fire roasted tomatoes"
- "1 can (4 oz) diced green chiles"
- "1 1/4 cups milk or half and half"
- "1 1/2 cups chicken broth"
- "12 oz penne pasta"
- "1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese"
- "garnishes green onions sliced jalapeños salsa guacamole lime wedges optional"
instructions:
- "Cut chicken into bite sized chunks or strips - thighs work best for moister bites but breasts do fine. Season with half salt and pepper."
- "Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a heavy bottom pot over medium heat. Hear that sizzle as chicken hits pan? Cook until pieces lose pink, develop golden bits and smell savory, about 5-7 minutes. Remove chicken set aside."
- "Add remaining olive oil. Throw in sliced onions and peppers. Stir occasionally – they should soften and start caramelizing after 7-9 minutes, smell sweet and earthy. Watch edges brown but do not blacken."
- "Return chicken to pot. Sprinkle fajita seasoning and toss in garlic. Stir constantly - that aroma hits fast, 45 seconds to 1 minute max before garlic burns."
- "Pour in diced tomatoes with juices, green chiles for mild heat, milk (or half and half if you want it richer), broth, and dry penne pasta. Stir to combine everything evenly."
- "Raise heat to boil. Once rolling boil appears, reduce to a simmer to avoid wild bubbles that make a mess and cause uneven cooking. Stir every few minutes to prevent pasta clumping/sticking along bottom. Cook 17-22 minutes until penne swells and is just tender but slightly toothy. Sauce will be loose now, that’s expected."
- "Pull from heat. Fold in shredded cheddar cheese – it melts thickening sauce quickly, turning clammy liquid into creamy coating for each noodle and chunk. Taste for salt pepper, add if needed."
- "Serve with whatever you have handy - I throw green onions, slices jalapeños, a spoon of salsa, guacamole dollop, squeeze lime. It perks the whole thing up."
- "If short on time or pan space, slice chicken smaller so cooks faster and more even. Bone in chicken or thighs can add broth flavor but skip skin unless you crisp separately for texture contrast."
- "Use whole milk easily swapped with cream or unsweetened oat milk if dairy intolerant - flavor shifts but dish holds well."
- "Common traps: garlic burns fast, stir or remove from heat. Pasta sticks to pan if you don’t stir often especially near end. Sauce consistency looks thin pre-cheese but trust the melt thickens it."
introduction: "Chopped chicken cooks down fast revealing a slight crust around edges, juicy inside. Bell peppers and onion soften slowly, releasing sweet aromatic breath that fills the kitchen. Fajita seasoning hits that smoky, spicy note you expect but this time twined right into pasta cooking in one pot with broth and milk; it’s as if traditional Tex-Mex got cozy with Italian comfort. Using thigh meat changed the game for me–keeps the chicken from drying out in simmering liquid unlike plain breasts. The early stir-frying stage builds flavor foundations. Then comes the pasta soaking in tomato juice and broth, swelling with each gentle bubble. Melting cheddar finishes with gooey charm. The tweak of half and half amps creaminess but milk keeps it lighter, adaptable depending what fridge offers. Someone not fond of bell peppers? Swap them for zucchini or mushrooms, similar textures but softer taste. The dish fills bowls with vibrant colors peppers and cheese melting and bubbling perfectly. Sounds of simmering, smell of garlic and fajita spices blending – signals that comfort-food-harmony you chase after a long day."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken thighs over breasts unless you like them extra lean but watch cooking as thighs hold moisture longer. Split seasoning quantities to salt and pepper chicken first and finish after cheese for more precise flavor control. Bell peppers aren’t essential–zucchini melts similarly, mushrooms add earthier note. Use fire roasted diced tomatoes or regular if in a pinch but roasted brings charred depth. Green chiles canned are ideal for mild kick; swap canned jalapeños for more heat or poblano for milder flavor. Milk works fine but half and half or light cream transforms sauce to silkier texture; non-dairy oat milk is the go-to substitute tweaking flavor slightly but holds sauce properties. Sharp cheddar chosen for bite, but mozzarella or Monterey Jack yield melty mildness. Have broth homemade or store-bought? No big deal, broth layers savory elements. Olive oil is standard but a neutral oil like canola can work. Garlic peeled then minced fines spaces flavor all around faster. Fajita seasoning homemade beats store version but quick mix of smoked paprika, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder goes long way."
instructionsNote: "Cutting chicken either bite size or strips depends on personal bite preference; smaller dries faster but strips hold juiciness and look classic for fajitas. Preheating oil medium heat before chicken prevents sticking and seals juices inside. Remove cooked chicken early prevents overcooking when returned later. Onions and peppers must soften properly, take time for sugars to develop, key is color not speed here; dark brown edges good but black is burnt. Garlic added late after spices to avoid bitter burnt taste, stirring right off prevents scorching. Pouring liquids all at once swells pasta, stirring quick disperses ingredients and prevents clumps or stuck noodles. Achieving simmer over boil means controlling temperature as rolling boil will evaporate too fast and uneven cook pasta. Stirring every 3-4 minutes disrupts pasta settling on bottom, prevents burning; patience required here and sensory awareness. Once pasta cooked but still firm to bite, cheese goes in straight off heat to melt smooth without separating oils. Final taste test to balance salt, pepper because tomatoes canned vary salt levels wildly. Serve with garnishes that bring acidity, freshness, or heat to cut through creamy cheesy richness. If timing compressed, cut chicken extra small or parboil pasta briefly before combining but compromises integration of flavors. Remember sauce will thicken after resting, don’t overcook it to dry out."
tips:
- "Split salt and pepper quantities. Season chicken before browning then finish seasoning after cheese folds in. Locks flavors in layers not just surface. Watch chicken closely; thighs need more gentle cooking to stay juicy compared to breasts that dry fast."
- "Stirring peppers and onions during caramelizing is key. Wait for edges to brown but avoid black spots that turn bitter. Smell changes from raw sharpness to mild sweet earthiness, that’s a green light for adding spices and garlic right after."
- "Garlic burns fast, add it only after chicken returns and seasoning sprinkles in. Stir constantly for under 1 minute or flavor turns bitter. Removing from heat momentarily helps if you smell it scorching. Garlic aroma is a quick alert when it’s about right."
- "Pour liquids all at once and stir quickly so pasta doesn’t clump. Rolling boil then drop to steady simmer stops wild bubbles that throw sauce everywhere. Stir every few minutes especially near the end, pasta settles bottom, sticks and scorches without mid-cook attention."
- "Cheddar melts thickening sauce rapidly turning loose liquid into clingy creamy coat. Do not cook pasta until mush then add cheese. Keep penne slightly toothy; cheese finish balances moisture. Taste after cheese then adjust salt pepper to avoid over-seasoning."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken breasts instead? a: Breasts cook faster but dry out in simmer. Cut smaller or watch time. Thighs hold moisture better. If using breast, slice thin or try parboil pasta first to speed sync."
- "q: What if I don’t have fajita seasoning? a: Mix smoked paprika cumin chili powder garlic powder quick swap. Adjust quantities to get smoky heat. Or use taco seasoning if handy. Homemade blends better control on salt and spice levels."
- "q: Sauce is too thin after cooking? a: Cheese melts thick but if still loose, simmer a few more minutes off heat. Or add less broth next time. Stir well avoid burning bottom. Pasta continues absorbing some sauce as it rests."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container up to 3 days. Reheat gently with splash milk or broth to loosen thick sauce. Freeze if needed but texture changes slight. Stir during reheat for uniform heat, avoid drying out pasta."
