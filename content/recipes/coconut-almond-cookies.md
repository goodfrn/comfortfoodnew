ingredients:
- "175 ml desiccated coconut unsweetened"
- "100 ml sugar"
- "15 ml almond flour"
- "30 ml aquafaba (chickpea water) about 2 tablespoons"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "2.5 ml ground cinnamon half teaspoon"
- "2.5 ml vanilla extract half teaspoon"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175 degrees Celsius (350 Fahrenheit) rack centered. Line baking sheet with parchment."
- "Mix coconut, sugar, almond flour, salt, cinnamon, vanilla thoroughly in bowl."
- "Add aquafaba gradually, stirring until sticky dough forms but not wet. Add extra aquafaba cautiously if mix dry."
- "Wet hands lightly. Scoop around 25 ml each. Roll into balls, space them on tray well apart. Flatten gently with palm or fork."
- "Bake 12 to 15 minutes until edges golden brown but center slightly soft. Remove, cool fully on sheet before moving."
introduction: "The original coconut macaroons get a spin here. Almond flour steps in for all-purpose, boosting protein and texture, no gluten. Aquafaba replaces egg white, still sticky, still binds. Hold back some sugar, less candy, more natural coconut flavor. Cinnamon thrown in, dusting the mix with warmth. Warming smell as you bake, edges turn golden, chewy centers. No dairy, no nuts except almonds, and vegan. More depth, less sweetness. These cookies crumble softly but hold form. Baking at a slightly lower temp for five extra minutes brings more chew without over browning. Great snack. Good with afternoon tea, or morning coffee. One bite and you get coconut crunch, almond softness, spice hit. Not too sweet, not dry, just enough. Try swapping lemon or orange zest in. Change cinnamon to cardamom for more exotic hint. Simple, quick, flexible. Keep aquafaba right to avoid wet dough. Cool fully or else break apart. Store airtight. Make ahead for busy days. Options to add chopped dried fruit if liked. Takes 27 minutes total. Minimal effort, maximal taste."
ingredientsNote: "No bleached flour here—almond flour adds nuttiness and moisture. Coconut binds tightly with sugar, aquafaba adds that chewy hold. Cinnamon gives spice—optional but elevates flavor. Vanilla essential but subtle, don’t overdo. Salt in pinches, tightens flavors. Sugar less than usual for health and balance. Aquafaba carefully measured; liquid volume changes depending on brand or can. Too much makes dough runny. Dry coconut grabs moisture fast, dry environment means faster absorption. Measure flour and sugar properly. Coconut can vary: fresh or dry can change texture a lot. Best to mix, then adjust aquafaba bit by bit. Dough should hold shape. If sticky, chill before rolling. Paper on tray prevents sticking, no oil needed. Flat pressing helps cook evenly. Baking temp slightly lower but time longer for gentle browning and soft centers."
instructionsNote: "Rack in middle to avoid burning top or bottom. Oven preheat crucial for baking evenly. Mix all dry ingredients first to get flavor and texture uniform. Add wet ingredient slow to find mixture consistency, aim for moist but firm dough. Hands wet, roll uniform balls, spacing at least 5 cm apart to allow spreading without merging. Flatten gently to ensure even baking, no lumpiness. Bake 12 to 15 minutes, edges golden, middle just set but soft, keep checking after 10 minutes to avoid overbaking. After bake, leave on tray to cool fully—hot cookies fragile and fall apart. Transfer only once firmly set. Use parchment for easy cleanup and perfect bottoms. Store airtight at room temp. Use coated tins or plastic containers with lids prevents drying. Variations easy, swap spices or add citrus zest, nuts, or fruit bits to change profile. Watch aquafaba amounts — too much causes spreading, too little crumbly. Adjust with small extra teaspoon increments."
tips:
- "Consider measuring coconut tightly. It absorbs moisture fast. Humid days mean adjusting aquafaba. Not too runny, not too crumbly. Texture key."
- "Roll balls roughly 25 ml. Smaller than original size. Shapes can merge if too big. Space at least 5 cm apart on tray."
- "Remember to let cookies cool fully. Hot cookies are fragile. They will break apart. Transfer only once totally set. Patience pays off."
- "Swap cinnamon for cardamom for a unique twist. Add zest for brightness. Orange or lemon both work. Chopped dried fruit is great too."
- "Storing cookies? Use airtight container. Paper towel helps. Store at room temp. Keep away from humidity. Good for several days."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid dry dough? a: Gradually add aquafaba. Too much makes it runny. Not enough causes crumbling. Measure carefully."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, almond flour can use oat flour. Cinnamon is optional. Try different spices for fun."
- "q: What to do with leftovers? a: Store in airtight tin. Keep at room temp. Lasts a few days. Good for snacking anytime."
- "q: How to adjust for baking? a: Watch closely after 10 minutes. Edges need golden brown. Middle should remain soft. Don't rush."
