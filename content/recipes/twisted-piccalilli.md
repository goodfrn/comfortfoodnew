ingredients:
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cup) cauliflower cut tiny florets"
- "230 g (8 oz) pearl onions, peeled (tip: blanch in boiling water briefly then slip skins off)"
- "260 ml (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) fresh garden cucumber diced fine"
- "110 ml (slightly less than 1/2 cup) green beans cut 1/4 inch lengths"
- "1 medium apple diced small"
- "40 ml (2 1/2 tablespoons) coarse pickling salt"
- "10 ml (2 teaspoons) ground dry mustard powder"
- "10 ml (2 teaspoons) yellow mustard seeds"
- "7 ml (1 1/3 teaspoons) turmeric powder"
- "4 ml (just under 1 teaspoon) coriander seed cracked"
- "4 ml (under 1 teaspoon) cumin seed"
- "15 ml (1 tablespoon) finely chopped fresh ginger"
- "1 large garlic clove minced"
- "1 fresh red chili deseeded and sliced thin"
- "35 ml (2 1/3 tablespoons) light olive oil or avocado oil"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tablespoons) arrowroot powder or cornstarch"
- "290 ml (1 1/4 cup) raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar"
- "200 ml (about 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon) filtered water"
- "35 ml (2 1/3 tablespoons) raw cane sugar or coconut sugar"
instructions:
- "First. Dump cauliflower, pearl onions, cucumbers, green beans, apple and pickling salt into a big bowl. Cover with cold water by an inch or so. Let soak 1 hour at room temp; vegetables will firm, salt drawing out moisture."
- "Meanwhile, get your jars sterilized—boil or oven dry. Do not skip this! Clean lids and bands too."
- "Heat oil in a deep pan on medium. Tip in mustard seeds, dry mustard powder, cumin and coriander seeds. Toast until aromatic and seeds start crackling—about 2 minutes."
- "Add garlic, chili, and ginger. Sauté 1 minute. Smells taking over kitchen? Good."
- "Add arrowroot powder whisked into 60 ml cider vinegar to same pot. Stir till it thickens just slightly. Happens quick; do not let burn."
- "Drain vegetables well. Into pot pour veggies, remaining vinegar, water, and sugar. Stir."
- "Simmer gently. You want gentle bubbling, not a raging boil. Cook about 35 minutes stirring every 8-10 minutes. Test: veggies should be tender but still have bite—not mushy. Watch pearl onions soften and cauliflower go translucent but hold shape."
- "Turn off heat. Ladle hot piccalilli into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1 cm air space. Tap jars lightly to remove air bubbles with a plastic knife or chopstick."
- "Wipe rims clean with damp cloth. Fit lids on snug but don’t overtighten. Place jars in simmering water bath; cover with 2.5 cm water."
- "Bring to roiling boil and keep bubbling 16 minutes. Timer starts once full boil hits again. Do not let water level drop—add hot water if needed."
- "Remove jars carefully, let cool undisturbed 12-16 hours on wooden surface or towel. Lid should pop down slightly signaling vacuum seal."
- "Store unopened in cool dark spot. Refrigerate after opening."
introduction: "Forget the usual mushy pickles. Learned early that salt soak, gentle simmer—everything’s about texture. Too often I wrecked cauliflower by rushing. This time, cumin and coriander seeds toasted just right, releasing that warm, earthy fragrance climbing the kitchen air. Made one swap—cucumber fresh, not cornichon. Apple adds crunch plus sweetness balance, sometimes overlooked. Chili’s subtle, just enough heat punches through. Stirring every now and then throughout the simmer keeps veggies moving, preventing sticking, cooking evenly. Thickness from arrowroot, not cornstarch, silkier mouthfeel I swear by. Water bath seals jars tight, stores months if you trust the process. Fresh garlic and ginger bring kick, don’t overpower. It’s all about layering flavors and textures. Jars popping as they cool is the real applause. Done right, it’s joy in every bite. Slathering on thick toast or alongside curry—total game changer."
ingredientsNote: "Pearl onions, tedious but worth it; blanching frees skins easily. Cauliflower must be firm, trimmed tight small florets for quick, even cooking. Green beans chopped mono-size so every bite even. Fresh cucumber substitutes cornichons well: crisp, lighter acidity. Apple diced small, a tart variety balances sweet elements. Mustard powder and seeds form base flavor; don’t skimp or skip—dry heat to wake them up. Ground turmeric not just color but warmth and subtle bitterness; add too much? Turns bitter, so measure carefully. Coriander and cumin cracked seed release deep spice notes, better toasted whole vs powder. Fresh ginger & garlic must be finely minced, must punch through acidity without overwhelming. Chili deseeded unless you want big fire. Oil neutral, high smoke point like canola or avocado to carry spices without altering taste. Arrowroot powder better than corn starch for clarity and non-gummy texture. Vinegar raw, unfiltered cider preferred; white works but taste changes—adjust sugar accordingly. Sugar balances acidity; raw cane or coconut sugar gives better depth than plain white."
instructionsNote: "Soaking veggies with salt is deliberate—firm up, draw out excess water, season core. Oversaturate and the end product slumps; drain well—think damp, not soggy. Toasting spices vital for depth and aroma; must hear soft pop and smell toasted earthiness. Adding garlic, ginger, chili after seeds toast prevents burning these delicate bits. Slurry made with arrowroot and vinegar thickens liquid immediately; stir nonstop or clumps form ruining glossy finish. Combine veggies in pot with remaining vinegar, water, sugar—bring just under boil, then reduce to low simmer. Simmer 30-35 min is sweet spot; test texture often—pierce onion easily, cauliflower translucent but holding. Stirring prevents scorching; patience crucial here. Fill hot jars leaving headspace—tap to release bubbles. Wipe jar rims clean meticulously because any food residue prevents airtight seal. Lids on snug, not tight. Hot water bath with 2.5 cm covering water ensures full sterilization without jar cracking. Boil 16 minutes starting as soon as steam roars. Remove carefully—don’t tip or jar may crack. Let cool completely undisturbed; lids pop indicating vacuum seal. Store in cool, dark place unopened. Open jars get fridge life; use within 3-4 weeks for freshness. Avoid mold or soured flavors by proper sealing and refrigeration once open."
tips:
- "Salt soak raw veggies in cold water; crucial for crunch, draws out moisture. Don’t rush here. Drain very well or watery base ruins texture. Pearls onions need blanching first to slip skins easily; saves irritation. Use kosher or pickling salt only. Iodized salt clouds brine unpredictably, avoid it."
- "Toast mustard seeds and cumin coriander seeds dry till aromatic but no black spotting. Listen for soft pops, smell the warming earthiness. Too hot and bitterness kills flavor. Add garlic chili ginger only after seeds crackle to prevent burning. Timing critical."
- "Arrowroot powder slurry thickens fast; stir constantly when adding with some cider vinegar to avoid lumps. Cornstarch can replace but turns dull, arrowroot keeps glaze clear, glossy. Pour slowly, keep stirring or texture turns gritty."
- "Simmer veggies gently—no rolling boil. Watch cauliflower turn translucent but hold shape; onions tender but intact. Stir every 8-10 min to prevent sticking or scorching. Test bite often. Overcook and veggies lose snap, mushy mess."
- "Hot pack jars with one cm space; tap lids with knife or chopstick to release air bubbles. Clean rims meticulously—any residue breaks seals causing spoilage. Water bath depth 2.5 cm minimum. Start timer after rolling boil. Don’t let water drop, add hot water if needed."
faq:
- "q: How to keep veggies crunchy? a: Salt soak draws out water, firms insides. Don’t skip or shortcuts make soggy results. Drain good. Cook low simmer only, watch timing. Test by piercing onion—should be tender but not falling apart."
- "q: Can I swap spices? a: Mustard seeds toasted bring pungency; skip and base dull. Turmeric for color and faint bitter warmth—too much? Bitter. Coriander and cumin cracked better than ground, more aroma. Fresh chili best but dried flakes work in pinch."
- "q: What if jars don’t seal? a: Check rims clean, lids snug not tight. Water bath timing crucial, boiling steady. Jars crack if hot shocking or water too shallow. Re-boil jars or refrigerate and eat soon if seal fails."
- "q: How long stored safely? a: Cool dark spot unopened, flavor builds weeks. Once open fridge life 3-4 weeks max. Don’t rush. Mold from weak seal or contamination. Use sterilizing methods, water bath, wipe rims well."
