- "Set oven rack mid-height. Preheat oven to 175°C (347°F). Grease 20 cm (8 in) square pan and line with parchment strips, leaving edges overhang."
- "Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, salt in bowl. Set aside."
- "In saucepan, bring brown sugar, water, molasses to boil. Remove from heat. Stir in butter and chocolate until melted."
- "Whisk in egg quickly till smooth. Fold in dry ingredients gently with spatula until combined."
- "Pour batter into pan. Bake 22 min or until toothpick clean. Cool slightly."
- "=== Pumpkin filling and final baking ==="
- "Whisk cream, pumpkin puree, brown sugar, egg yolk in separate bowl until blended."
- "Pour pumpkin mixture over hot cake layer. Bake 28 min or until center still jiggles slightly when nudged."
- "Remove from oven. Let cool on rack. Chill 2 hours or until fully set. Freeze here if wanted."
- "=== Candy seeds ==="
- "Over medium heat, stir pumpkin seeds, honey, water in small pan constantly until syrup granulates and coats seeds. Spread on plate to cool completely."
- "=== Whipped cream and serving ==="

- "Lift cake from pan using parchment. Cut into 16 squares. Dollop cream on each square. Sprinkle candied seeds over top."
- "Store airtight in fridge up to 3 days."
introduction: "Warm spices, molasses, and chocolate meld in a dense spiced cake. Pumpkin cream fills the top—a smooth mix with a subtle wobble after baking. Toasted pumpkin seeds get a sticky crust from honey and water, candied crisp and sweet. The layers contrast each other: firm cake, creamy pumpkin, crunchy seeds. Optional whipping cream adds softness and extra richness. Bake moderate oven heat, allow full chilling time for best texture. The squares keep refrigerated for several days, freeze after chilling if needed. Serve cool or room temp. Variations with different spices or nut-free substitutions. Fun for fall and holiday tables. Rich, textured, slightly chewy, lightly sweet."
ingredientsNote: "Flour quantity reduced about 25%. Baking powder and soda adjusted to balance leavening—slightly increased for lift. Cinnamon bumped up, ginger and nutmeg doubled for stronger spice punch. Brown sugar reduced; molasses slightly less to keep sugar controlled. Butter increased slightly for richness. Dark chocolate changed to 65% cacao for milder bitterness. Water amount raised to offset flour reduction, keeping batter moist. Pumpkin puree increased for fuller filling, brown sugar slightly lower to maintain proper sweetness. Seeds lessened for balance, honey replaces sugar for candying, adding floral note. Whipping cream unchanged, for proper texture and creaminess. All changes aim for 30% ingredient quantity shift and better balance."
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven fully before batter gets ready, trapeze layering ensures even cooking. Batter is thick but stir gently to avoid tough gluten. Bake first layer slightly longer (+2 min) to prevent soggy base from pumpkin topping. Pumpkin filling baked til soft but still shakes—a slight jiggle perfect for texture. Seeds cooked slowly on medium heat to avoid burning; stir constantly to caramelize evenly. Cool seeds thoroughly to harden candy coating. Whipping cream beaten to soft peaks to prevent over-whipping, which leads to grainy texture. Chill cake minimum 2 hours, overnight preferred for clean cuts and flavor melding. Use parchment edges to lift cake gently, prevents breaking. Slicing into 16 squares ensures manageable serving size. Top with cream and seeds just before serving to keep crunchy contrast crisp. Store airtight, layers keep moist without sogginess for 3 days. Freeze after chilling rather than fully baked for best structure and thaw quality."
tips:
- "Batter is thick but don't overmix. Fold dry ingredients gently. Over stirring develops gluten. Dense but tender texture depends on this. Use spatula not whisk here."
- "First cake layer bakes 22 minutes. Check with toothpick. It must be just set, no wet crumbs but not fully dry. Let cool only slightly before adding pumpkin layer."
- "Pumpkin filling is soft, slightly wobbly after bake. Don’t overbake or filling turns too firm. Look for gentle jiggle near center when nudged, that’s the sign."
- "Candy pumpkin seeds on medium heat. Stir constantly. Syrup should granulate but not burn. Spread to cool fully on flat surface. Coating hardens as it cools for crisp texture."
- "Chill cake minimum 2 hours. Overnight better to firm layers. Chilled cake cuts cleaner, no smearing. Use parchment overhang edges to lift cake from pan without cracking."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute pumpkin puree? a: Yes, but adjust moisture. Use mashed sweet potato or butternut squash. Texture might differ. Taste a bit less pumpkin-y though."
- "q: How long to chill before slicing? a: At least 2 hours. Longer for best firm texture. Refrigerate fully cool cake after baking. Chilling blends flavors, sets filling layer better."
- "q: Why does pumpkin filling jiggle? a: Egg yolk sets but softly. Pumpkin and cream keep it loose. Over bake and filling tightens, under bake it’s too runny. Jiggle means balanced."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Airtight container in fridge up to 3 days. Freeze after chilling, not baked through. Thaw in fridge, keep layers intact. Avoid room temp long time."
