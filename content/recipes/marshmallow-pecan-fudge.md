title: "Marshmallow Pecan Fudge Twist"
slug: "marshmallow-pecan-fudge"
description: "Rich fudge with toasted pecans and gooey mini marshmallows, melding bittersweet cocoa and a hint of sea salt. Cream and brown sugar form a caramel-like base, reducing the sugar intensity. Toast nuts for crunch and aroma. Watch the candy thermometer to hit soft ball stage just right; too low and fudge won’t set, too high risks graininess. Stirring long after heat is off melts marshmallows into chewy pockets. Chill for firm bite, then cut into bite-sized squares. Swap milk chocolate for semi-bitter chocolate for deeper flavor; add flaky salt or a drop of vanilla extract for added depth."
metaDescription: "Marshmallow Pecan Fudge Twist rich in toasted nuts, gooey pockets. Brown sugar caramel base, bittersweet cocoa punch. Stir long, chill well, cut neat bites."
ogDescription: "Sticky, nutty fudge with mini marshmallows melting into chewy surprises. Watch sugar closely, timing crucial. Chill for firm squares. Reality in every bite."

ingredients:
- "300 ml toasted halves pecans"
- "200 ml heavy cream 35%"
- "200 ml packed brown sugar"
- "200 g bittersweet chocolate chopped"
- "400 ml mini marshmallows"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/4 tsp flaky sea salt"
instructions:
- "Crackling pecans in hot pan or oven. Watch closely til spots turn darker; smell rich nutty aroma. Cool before use to keep them crisp—no soggy pieces."
- "Heavy cream and brown sugar in saucepan. Bring low boil, small bubbles forming around edges, sugar fully dissolved. Slow and steady heat to avoid scorching sugar on bottom."
- "Add chopped bittersweet chocolate off direct heat, stir gently till melted into thick glossy sauce. Use spatula to get every last shiny bit. Put candy thermometer in."
- "Turn heat back to medium. Boil gently, stirring constantly. When thermometer hits 114°C to 116°C (approaching firm ball stage), remove from heat immediately. Timing critical here; overshoot and fudge gets grainy, undershoot and it won’t set."
- "Pour hot fudge into large bowl and add vanilla extract plus flaky salt. Stir in mini marshmallows and toasted pecans."
- "Use sturdy wooden spoon to stir 10 to 20 minutes. Marshmallows start dissolving but still keep chew. Texture changes from glossy to thick and matte—critical tactile sign the sugar is crystallizing correctly."
- "Line 13 x 23 cm pan with parchment paper. Pour fudge mixture in. Tap pan gently on counter to release air bubbles and level out surface."
- "Let it cool at room temperature uncovered until firm but still soft to press; about 30 minutes depending on kitchen climate. Then transfer to fridge for 15 minutes if needed for sharper cut."
- "Cut into 36 small squares with sharp knife cleanly wiped between cuts."
- "Store airtight in cool place but not fridge to avoid drying out. Will keep several days."
- "Substitutions: walnuts instead of pecans; coconut cream instead of heavy cream for dairy-free alternative but expect texture shift; white chocolate for sweeter but softer fudge."
- "Problem solver: fudge too soft? Heat longer but risk grainy. Too hard? Slightly undercook and chill less. Sticky fudge? Stir longer off heat to finish crystallization."
- "Efficiency trick: toast nuts and prep ingredients beforehand. Use silicone spatula for scraping. Use candy thermometer accurate to 1 degree for best results."
introduction: "Sweetness that grabs your attention and doesn’t let go. Toasted nuts snap under tongue’s pressure, marshmallows puddle in soft molten pools. Notes of bittersweet chocolate anchor teeth and fingers sticky with fudge. Past attempts taught me patience; the slow simmer, watching thermometer, stirring for what feels like forever — all pay off. Brown sugar over white lends a rustic depth, takes edge off oversweetness. Vanilla and sea salt? Game changers, subtle push-pull on flavor that keeps you reaching back. The key’s recognizing when fudge changes its sheen, how it coats the spoon thick and linger. No guessing, but listening with nose and eyes, fingers. Calling it a candy is like saying a symphony is just noise—there’s more to feel and know here."
ingredientsNote: "Toasted nuts aren’t optional; bare nuts bring muted flavor and flop in texture. Brown sugar reacts differently than white — mellower, caramel notes, but test your sugar’s moisture content; some brown sugars vary and affect final texture. Vanilla extract lifts the fudge from clunky to refined, don’t skip, even if it’s just a teaspoon. Mini marshmallows add both chew and sweetness but not too many or the fudge will refuse to set properly. Flaky sea salt is final punctuation; coarse salt bits contrast sweet, balancing act. Cream should be full fat to lend richness and proper mouthfeel; no skim here. Chocolate quality matters; mid- or bittersweet with real cocoa butter beats cheap chips every time."
instructionsNote: "Step one, toast nuts until you hear them pop, smell deep nutty scent, then cool. Cream and sugar heat slowly, bubbles starting at edges, no roaring boil or sugar will scorch quietly and ruin lusciousness. Adding chocolate off heat helps avoid seizing. The thermometer’s climb is anxiety and thrill mixed; soft ball stage between 114ºC and 116ºC is gold. Heat off, quick stir in vanilla then marshmallows and nuts. Stir for 10–20 minutes — this stage is all about tactile clues — fudge thickening, marshmallows melting but still chunked. Pour into prepared pan, level with taps. Cool on counter till just firm then chill for clean cuts. Patience pays; avoid cutting sleepy fudge or it crumbles. Use sharp knife, wipe clean with damp cloth between cuts. Keep containers tight, room temp preferred to maintain soft, chewable glorious bites."
tips:
- "Toast nuts until pops crackle, smell deep nutty rich aroma. Cool fully or risk sogginess. Crisp nuts clatter under bite, texture key here not limp cinnamon compared to raw."
- "Bring cream and brown sugar up slow. Tiny edge bubbles first, no rush. Sugar dissolves better at steady low boil, scorching ruins caramel base flavor instantly. No high heat."
- "Add chocolate off heat to avoid seizing. Stir gently, watch glossy sauce form. Use spatula to scrape every remnant. Candy thermometer inserted now, critical for next step."
- "Boil gently medium heat stirring constant. Thermometer 114° to 116°C critical soft ball stage. Undershoot fudge soft won’t set. Overshoot grainy texture. Timing here dictates final bite."
- "Long stir after heat off, 10 to 20 minutes. Marshmallows melt into chew pockets, glossy turns matte, tactile sign sugar crystallizing. Patience pays. Won’t look perfect at first glance."
- "Pour fudge in parchment lined pan, tap counter to level and release air bubbles. Cool uncovered till firm but soft to press. Then fridge 15 min if sharper cut needed. Avoid cutting too soon."
- "Storage best room temp airtight. Fridge dries fudge quickly. Will keep several days. If fudge too soft reheating gently or longer cooking try. Too hard? Chill less, undercook slightly."
- "Substitute walnuts for pecans if nut allergy or preference. Coconut cream replaces heavy cream but expect softer fudge, different texture. White chocolate gives sweeter softer fudge variant."
faq:
- "q: How to know soft ball stage? a: Watch thermometer closely. 114 to 116°C range only. Sugar thickens, syrup feels tacky. Too low fudge soft. Too high grainy. No guesswork needed."
- "q: Can I skip nuts? a: Yes but taste suffers. Nuts add crunch and aroma. Without them fudge less complex, texture flop. Try walnuts as swap; texture and flavor shift but still solid."
- "q: What if fudge stays sticky? a: Often undercooked or not stirred enough. Stir longer off heat to crystallize sugar fully. If sticky, chill less or undercook slightly next batch. Trial important."
- "q: How to store fudge best? a: Airtight container, room temp favored. Fridge dries it fast unless you want harder chew. Can last several days. Wrap cuts separately if worried about moisture."
