ingredients:
- "5 cups coleslaw mix"
- "1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper"
- "1/2 medium red onion chopped finely"
- "1/3 cup fresh cilantro roughly chopped"
- "1 cup drained crushed pineapple reserve 3 tablespoons juice"
- "3/4 cup mayonnaise"
- "2 tablespoons reserved pineapple juice"
- "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar"
- "1 tablespoon dark brown sugar"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1 teaspoon poppy seeds"
instructions:
- "Step back with coleslaw mix in a big bowl; toss in pepper, chopped onion, cilantro, and the drained pineapple chunks. Juice from pineapple? Hang onto 3 tablespoons for later. The moisture’s crucial but too much kills crunch."
- "Whisk together mayo, 2 tablespoons of the reserved pineapple juice, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, salt, and poppy seeds in a separate bowl. Aim for balance; sweet, tangy, creamy. Don’t skip the poppy seeds — little bursts of texture and subtle nutty flavor."
- "Pour the dressing over the slaw mix. Toss gently but thoroughly; fold ingredients rather than stir like mad. Want every shred coated but keep it looking fresh, not soggy."
- "Cover and slide in the fridge. Wait about 55 minutes, but after half an hour, poke and sniff. The smell should deepen, a little sharp, a little sweet. Texture? Crisp but softened slightly; if soggy, you rushed the dressing mix or over-crushed the pineapple."
- "Just before serving, taste. Add more salt or a dash more vinegar if needed. Cilantro fades in the cold, so freshen with a sprinkle if you like. Consider a squeeze of lime for brightness if you swapped out vinegar or missed the tang."
introduction: "Pineapple in slaw sounds unusual but trust me, it’s a revelation. Done wrong? Soup. Mush. Overly sweet, tasteless crud. I’ve been there, tweaked this over many cookouts. Cilantro not parsley shakes up the whole flavor game — freshness and slight sharpness dancing under sweet pineapple hits. Use crushed pineapple, drained well; don’t drown the mix in juice. Dressing’s a delicate play between mayo’s richness, vinegar’s bite, and sugar’s mellow hug. The poppy seeds, often skipped, bring an underrated crunch punch. Chill it long enough to marry flavors but keep crunch alive; you’ll know when from smell and feel, not the clock. Toss gently — slaw ain’t a stew. It’s a textural dance on the palate."
ingredientsNote: "If fresh pineapple’s available, dice small and drain pulp over a sieve, pressing lightly — watch out, too much juice means soggy slaw, no crunch. Mayonnaise is the base, but swap in Greek yogurt for a lighter tang or a vegan mayo to avoid dairy. Apple cider vinegar can go apple or even white if that’s what’s on hand, but keep acidity similar — too much and the slaw goes sharp quickly. Brown sugar is best here; adjust sweetness to your pineapples’ natural sugar content. Poppy seeds? Don’t leave them out; substitutes like sesame seeds work but change flavor profiles. Cilantro over parsley is personal — use what fresh herb you prefer but it changes vibrancy dramatically."
instructionsNote: "Start with the dry mix to avoid sogginess—pineapple juice should be carefully reserved and measured for the dressing, too much ruins the texture. Whisk dressing components well; sugar has to dissolve into vinegar first before mingling with mayo for smoothness. Tossing the slaw gently keeps cabbage intact; you want crunch, not shredded mush. Rest in fridge at least 50 minutes but check texture about 30 mins in by smelling a bit and poking shreds — should feel firm but yielding. Stir right before serving; chill dulls herbs’ intensity, so freshening last minute with a few chopped leaves or lime juice is a shortcut to brightness. Common mistake: adding dressing too early or over-mixing quickly kills crispness."
tips:
- "Drain pineapple thoroughly. Too much juice? Slaw soggy and limp. Press pulp lightly with back of spoon on sieve. Reserve exactly for dressing, no more no less. Keeps crunch alive. Drain juice last, add vinegar before mayo whisk."
- "Chop onion finely. Avoid big chunks or overpowering bites. Cedarlike crunch with onion sharpness plays well with sweetness. Toss dry ingredients before pouring dressing, stops wilting before coat. Use sharp knife, quick chops keep freshness intact."
- "Whisk dressing long enough. Sugar dissolves first in vinegar. Mayo folds in thick creamy but still loose. If you skip dissolving sugar, gritty crunch under tongue. Use bowl bigger than you think for folding, to avoid overworking."
- "Fridge chill essential but don’t lock in too long. Half hour poke test. Smell pungent but not sour, texture shifts from snap to tender crunch, never mushy. Over wait and cilantro fades, slaw dulls. Half hour is sweet spot most times but adjust with heat or pineapple ripeness."
- "Substitutions: Greek yogurt swaps mayo for tangy light, vegan mayo for dairy-free. Apple cider vinegar replace with white or apple, but taste shift sharpens. Poppy seeds optional but add subtle crunch, sesame seeds okay but flavor change. For herbs, cilantro bold, parsley mellow, choose what suits final sharpness you want."
faq:
- "q: Can I use fresh pineapple instead of crushed? a: Yes but drain pulp well. Dice small, press juice on sieve. Too much moisture kills crunch. Juice reserved for dressing keeps flavor balanced."
- "q: What if slaw is soggy after mixing? a: Likely too much pineapple juice or over-mixed. Next time drain better, fold gently not stir furious. Chill shorter. You can fluff with fresh cabbage before serving."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Fridge in airtight container best. Keeps crispness 1-2 days before wilting. Can refresh by adding fresh cilantro or a squeeze lime before serving again. Avoid long storage, herbs and crunch degrade fast."
- "q: Alternatives to apple cider vinegar? a: White vinegar or mild apple vinegar works but taste shift sharper. Use slightly less or add a pinch sugar. Lemon juice okay but changes bright acidity. Balance needed to not overpower mayo base."
