slug: "creamy-four-ingredient-mac"
description: "Takes elbow macaroni, sharp cheddar swirl, heavy cream, and cream cheese, reworked for that baked golden crust. Quick heat paths, gradual meltdowns of cheese, and oven finishing make this straightforward yet rich dish. Use feta to swap in for cream cheese, adding tang and crumbly texture layers. Watch the pasta's bite, let cheese melt in stages, and catch that bubbling edge as the sign to broil. Salt and pepper balance the dairy richness. A reliable, indulgent weeknight go-to. Serves ten with generous portions."

ingredients:
- "1 lb elbow macaroni"
- "12 oz sharp cheddar cheese, shredded and divided"
- "1 1/2 cups heavy cream"
- "6 oz feta cheese, crumbled"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "Nonstick cooking spray"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 345°F. Spray a 9x13 baking pan thickly with nonstick spray. No skipping this--sticking ruins the whole bake."
- "Grab your biggest grater; shred cheddar coarsely, divide roughly into three equal piles. Less fiddly than meticulously measuring."
- "Boil salted water hard. Dump in pasta according to the box but cut 2-3 minutes before fully al dente—firm but forgiving. Hot, salty starchy water smells like success."
- "Meanwhile, set heavy cream in a separate large pot over medium-low heat. Watch closely to catch the steam rising, not boiling. Lower heat once steaming."
- "Add crumbled feta now, whisk like your life depends on it. The tangy curds melt slowly, don’t rush it or it’ll seize. Blend until creamy-ish but a bit textured. Add salt; feta is salty but needs balancing."
- "Toss in one-third of shredded cheddar gradually, whisking until it melts into a bubbly, slightly grainy sauce. Turn heat to low, stir in 1/3 teaspoon pepper."
- "Pasta should be drained well but not rinsed—need that starch clinging to sauce. Toss pasta into the cheese base. Mix thoroughly; sauce coats every nook."
- "Sprinkle next third shredded cheddar over pasta; fold gently but don’t melt. This creates melty pockets later. Transfer mixture into your greased baking dish, spread evenly."
- "Top off with the last third of cheddar evenly over the surface. Make sure it’s an even layer to get that golden, crispy top."
- "Bake for about 18-22 minutes. Look for edges bubbling fiercely and cheese melting into gooey lakes. Edges should inch towards crisp."
- "Kick oven to broil low. Watch like a hawk, 2-4 minutes max. When cheese bubbles and crisps to golden brown spots, done. Don’t walk away."
- "Pull from oven and let rest uncovered for 10 minutes. Sauce thickens—the trick for perfect texture. Any stray oil will recess into the cheese as it cools, no need to blot."
introduction: "Cheese, cream, pasta—simple combo but tricky to nail the right texture and flavor balance. I’ve learned to hold back the pasta just short of al dente—keeps it from mush once baked. Heavy cream heats gently, no boiling or scalding—that’s where cheesy sauces go south quick. Substituted feta for cream cheese once, that tangy crumble shifted the dish to a new dimension—richer, sharply savory rather than just smooth. Grating cheese by hand beats pre-shredded every time; it melts better, no anti-caking powder chemicals muddy the mouthfeel. Broiling at the end? Non-negotiable; gives that punch of golden crust I crave. Leave it resting before serving—you’ll thank me when it’s cohesive and not a lava river."
ingredientsNote: "You’ll want sharp cheddar preferably aged 2+ months; sharpness is key to counter the creaminess. Grate larger chunks by hand; pre-shredded has anti-caking agents that dull melt and cause clumping. The feta swap adds acidity and crunch texture—it doesn’t fully melt so expect little pockets of briny surprise. Heavy cream should be full fat—no skimping or subbing milk, sauce won’t hold. Salt carefully since cheese brings varying saltiness; I salt the pasta water generously and then adjust final seasoning to taste. Cooking spray on the pan avoids baked-on disasters; butter works but harder to spread evenly. Pasta shape matters: elbow macaroni is classic but shells or cavatappi can work—just watch cooking times."
instructionsNote: "Heating cream until just steaming means avoiding curdling later. Don’t rush melting cheeses; slow whisking over low heat prevents grainy sauces. Add cheese gradually to control melt and texture—you want creamy but not oily separation. Drain pasta but don’t rinse; starch is your ally for sauce adhesion. Folding some cheese into pasta before baking creates pockets of melted bliss instead of uniform glue. Oven temperature adjusted slightly down helps prevent initial crust overcooking. The broil step is delicate; cheese can burn fast. Rest time solidifies sauce, gives viscous, clingy texture—skip resting and you’ll get runny disappointment. Trust sensory cues over timers: bubbling edges, golden spots, cream steam—all speak volumes."
tips:
- "Grate cheddar by hand; pre-shredded often has anti-caking powders that mess with melt and texture. Divide cheese into thirds for gradual melt—first batch blends into the cream-feta base slowly, provides controlled texture, stops graininess. Last third lays thick, crisps golden under broiler. Don’t skip gradual melt or sauce gets oily or clumpy."
- "Hold pasta a few minutes short of al dente. Pasta absorbs sauce in oven, finishes cooking gently. Overcooked pasta = mush later. Remember: starch clinging on surface helps sauce stick; rinse kills this advantage. Salt water heavily; it seasons pasta core even through bake."
- "Heat heavy cream just till steam rises, no boil. Boiling causes curdling or separation when adding cheese. Add crumbled feta while warm, whisk fast; tangy curds melt unevenly, patience needed for creamy result with textured pockets. Low heat crucial here, no shortcuts."
- "Broiling stage is key. Watch closely—a minute too long and cheese burns or dries out. Bubbling edge, golden brown spots signal readiness. Oven temp adjusted down from typical 350 to 345 to prevent surface crust overcooking before inner sauce thickens properly."
- "Rest dish 10 minutes, uncovered, after baking. Thickens sauce, lets oils settle back in cheese mass. Skipping rest causes runny texture, no clinging creaminess. Ideal hit texture from thick sauce—you’ll see surface dull slightly versus glossy immediately out of oven."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap feta for cream cheese? a: Yes but texture shifts—feta keeps pockets of tang and crumbly bites. Cream cheese gives ultra smooth. Different mouthfeel, edges on each side. Adjust salt carefully—as feta adds saltiness naturally."
- "q: What if sauce separates? a: Usually heat too high or cheese added too fast. Lower heat, add cheese in batches. Whisk constantly. Cream steaming not boiling is essential. If separated, whisk vigorously off heat or add little starch slurry to rebind."
- "q: How to avoid mushy pasta? a: Stop boiling pasta 2-3 mins before al dente, remember oven finishes cooking. Drain well but no rinsing! Pasta starches cling to sauce. Overcooked pasta soggy after baking. Texture depends on timing and water temps."
- "q: Best storage method? a: Fridge in airtight container up to 3 days. Reheat gently on stovetop or oven; add splash milk or cream to loosen sauce. Avoid microwave bursts—it dries edges. Leftover reheat won’t rebake crust crisp, broil brief if needed for top texture."
