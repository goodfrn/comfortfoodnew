slug: "cheesy-broccoli-potato-soup"
description: "Chunky, cheesy potato soup loaded with broccoli, a creamy swanson base, melted cheese, and sour cream. Potatoes microwaved till soft, broccoli steamed till tender but still vibrant. Onion base with celery seed, seasoned and simmered to meld flavors. Final cheese melt and sour cream stir-in for that tang and richness. Bacon and green onions make a crispy, fresh topping. Comfort food that lets some potato texture hang around. Swapping cheddar for smoked gouda adds a twist; keeps it rich, smoky. Soup thick but not gluey. Experience layered with spices, textures from tender potato chunks and slightly crunchy broccoli pieces. Simple, efficient, flavors develop fast, no endless boiling. Fork pokes guide cook times, sensory cues tell when to move on."

ingredients:
- "4 large potatoes, washed and fork-poked"
- "3 cups broccoli florets"
- "4 tbsp butter"
- "1 medium onion, diced"
- "1 tsp celery seed"
- "salt to taste"
- "freshly ground black pepper to taste"
- "1/2 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 cup Swanson Cream Starter or heavy cream"
- "1 cup whole milk"
- "2 cups shredded smoked gouda (replace cheddar)"
- "1/2 cup sour cream"
- "1/3 cup cooked, crumbled bacon"
- "2 green onions, chopped"
instructions:
- "Wash potatoes thoroughly, poke several times with fork. Place in microwave-safe bowl without water. Heat for 11-12 minutes, checking softness by poking – flesh should yield easily but not fall apart."
- "Meanwhile, steam broccoli in microwave-safe bowl with 2 tbsp water, covered loosely with plastic wrap, for 6-9 minutes until bright green and tender-crisp. Drain and chop coarsely."
- "In a heavy-bottomed pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add diced onions, sprinkle celery seed, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Stir frequently till onions turn translucent, about 6 minutes. Smell should be sweet, no browning."
- "Rough-chop cooked potatoes and add to pot along with broccoli, Swanson Cream Starter, and milk. Use a potato masher to gently crush – keep some chunks for texture. Avoid complete purée; want body, not glue."
- "Turn heat to medium-high till mixture bubbles at edges. Lower to simmer, cover partially and cook about 17 minutes to marry flavors. Stir occasionally, listen to subtle bubbling, avoid burning the bottom."
- "Add shredded gouda cheese and sour cream. Stir gently but thoroughly till cheese melts fully into smoothness with sour cream thickening soup. Let rest off-heat for 6 minutes to settle flavors, thicken slightly."
- "Taste, adjust salt and pepper—sour cream adds acidity, so balance accordingly. Serve hot in bread bowls or bowls, topping with crispy crumbled bacon and sliced green onions for crunch and smoky freshness."
introduction: "Cold days demand thick, cheesy soups with texture. Potatoes never should dissolve fully; those soft lumps give body, bite. Years fiddling taught me not to boil potatoes forever — microwave cooks them faster, keeps starch controlled. Steam broccoli just right — vibrant green, tender but firm. Onion base with butter and celery seed brings subtle earthy notes, not overwhelming. Swanson Cream Starter speeds creaminess up; if absent, plain heavy cream works fine but slow the heat and watch thickness. Gouda swapped for cheddar, smoky and creamy, elevates flavor depth. Sour cream final stir adds tang and silkiness. Crumbled bacon and green onion finish— crunch and brightness, essential. Timing isn’t exact; visual and tactile clues rule the kitchen here."
ingredientsNote: "Potatoes: Russet or Yukon gold; texture changes with variety. Microwave shortcut: fork-poke before cooking—soft evenly but avoid mush. Broccoli: fresh, firm heads best. Frozen works if no fresh, but watch moisture. Steaming keeps crunch; boiling makes mushy green. Celery seed, small but punchy; omit if unavailable or sub fresh celery stalk finely chopped. Swanson Cream Starter can swap for heavy cream or full-fat milk but adjust seasoning. Butter quality impacts base flavor. Cheese swapped freely: gouda, gruyere, sharp white cheddar all shine differently. Sour cream: adds tang and richness, better than just cream. Bacon topping optional but recommended for smoky crunch. Green onion over parsley— bright but subtle."
instructionsNote: "Microwaving potatoes cuts downtime dramatically but watch for overcooking; poke nearby spots mid-cook to check doneness, breaks frustration of guesswork. Steaming broccoli in microwave traps steam, quick tenderizing with crisp retention; plastic wrap traps moisture—use safe wrap. Onion cooking stage critical; softening without browning enhances sweetness, too hot burns bitterness. Mashed potatoes are heart of texture here; partial mashing balances thickness and mouthfeel. Simmering melds flavor; low and gentle with partial lid keeps heat steady, avoids boil-over. Cheese added last prevents graininess; keep heat gentle. Resting soup after cheese mix gives time to thicken naturally; don’t rush final step. Always taste last—season well after adding dairy to balance salt properly. Serve with toppings for vibrant contrast, crucial to elevate richness."
tips:
- "Microwave potatoes fork-poked to speed cooking but check softness mid-cycle by poking different spots; avoids mushiness while keeping starch intact. Keeps texture chunky unlike boiling which dissolves too much. Use Russet or Yukon Gold—texture varies, Yukon gold softer, less earthy. Steam broccoli loosely covered with plastic wrap traps steam but watch time closely; too long loses crunch, too short stays tough. Chop coarsely after to keep bite."
- "Butter and diced onion base must soften without browning. Medium heat around six minutes. Smells sweet, onions translucent but no color change. Browning burns sweetness, adds bitter notes. Celery seed tiny powerhouse, omit if none but celery stalk finely minced gives green fresh hint. Add garlic powder late; raw garlic powder can overpower, better control here."
- "Mashed potatoes don’t want smooth puree; leave lumps for body. Mash gently with potato masher in pot with broccoli and cream base. Allows tenderness but avoids gluey thick. Stir bubbling edges for simmer cues. Low simmer under partial lid for about 17 minutes melds flavors. Burn bottom avoided by constant eye, stir occasionally; listen for subtle bubbles not roaring boil."
- "Shredded smoked gouda added last melts into creamy silkiness. Heat turned off or very low to avoid grainy cheese texture. Sour cream stirs in right after cheese, adds tang and thickness. Rest for 5-6 minutes lets soup thicken naturally. Skipping rest phases results in thinner, less cohesive texture. Season last since dairy dulls salt impact; adjust carefully."
- "Toppings boost mouthfeel and contrast. Crispy crumbled bacon sprinkled on top before serving adds smoky crunch, balances creamy base. Green onions chopped fresh, scatter over last for bright mild onion flavor—not parsley, which dulls texture contrast. Serve in bread bowls or regular bowls, either way adds rustic feel. Timing not exact, trust fork poke and bubbling sounds to guide doneness."
faq:
- "q: How to check potatoes without popping microwave? a: Open to poke mid-cook certain spots; avoids explosion, checks softness. Potatoes should yield easily but hold shape. No water added initially, causes steam burst if sealed tightly. Fork-poking all over before cooking also vents internally."
- "q: Can I use frozen broccoli? a: Yes but drain well to avoid soggy soup. Frozen broccoli loses firm snap after steaming; if fresh unavailable, reduce steaming time or microwave uncovered to evaporate water. Chop bigger pieces so texture stays. Frozen sometimes more watery; adjust liquid accordingly."
- "q: Soup too thick or gluey, what happened? a: Likely over-mashed potatoes or cooked too long. Overcooking breaks down starch too much making gluey base. Use gentle mashing only to keep chunks, avoid mixing too hard after cheese addition. Thin with milk or cream if thick after resting."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: In airtight container, fridge up to 3 days. Reheat slowly on stovetop low heat, stirring to prevent curdling. Cream thickens cold; add splash milk to loosen if needed. Soup freezes okay but cheese texture changes slightly; best fresh though."
