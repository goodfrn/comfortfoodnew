ingredients:
- "700 g (1 ½ lb plus 1 oz) boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut in cubes (approx 34 cubes)"
- "35 ml (2 ½ tbsp) olive oil"
- "2 ml (¾ tsp) fennel seeds crushed"
- "2 ml (¾ tsp) freshly cracked black pepper"
- "2 ml (¾ tsp) curry powder"
- "1 ml (⅓ tsp) kosher salt"
- "34 thin slices spicy chorizo (about 1 cm thick)"
- "34 pitted green olives rinsed well"
- "8 metal or soaked wooden skewers"
- "Optional garnish quarters lemon"
- "Optional sauce tzatziki"
- "Optional sauce hummus"
instructions:
- "1. Toss chicken cubes in olive oil with crushed fennel, black pepper, curry powder, and salt until evenly coated. Let flavors marry for at least 20 minutes if time allows, can skip but more taste builds. Prepping skewers now is key to speed later."
- "2. Thread each skewer with 4 chicken cubes, 6 chorizo slices, and 6 olives, alternating to keep a rhythm. Keep pieces compact but loose enough so heat circulates around for even cooking. Skip overcrowding—uneven, soggy bits ruin the mouthfeel."
- "3. Fire up barbecue on high until grill grates glow red-hot. Oil grates well with paper towel soaked in oil held by tongs. Prevent chicken sticking, no peeling bits during flip."
- "4. Place skewers directly over coals or burners. Listen for sizzling bursts, see sear lines forming. Grill 4 minutes per side (slightly longer than some recipes) to develop good color and sound. The crust from chorizo fat renders, smells sharp and smoky now."
- "5. Move skewers to cooler side of grill for indirect cooking. Close lid, let them cook slower about 10 minutes total. Touch chicken pieces, they should feel firm but have a little bounce. Juice runs clear, never pink or sticky. Using a thermometer? Aim for 75°C (165°F) internal but trust your hands more after time."
- "6. Remove skewers when chicken passes the tactile test and juices run clear. Rest them briefly on a tray or cutting board; the aromas rise, the meat pulls juicy without drying."
- "7. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over—brightens the richness. Offer tzatziki or hummus depending on mood and pantry. Feta crumbles or flatbread can be nice extras if you want to stray. Sometimes I add grilled veggies next time around, bell peppers or onions help balance the saltiness."
- "Cleanup tip: soaked wooden skewers before threading to avoid charring. Metal skewers heat fast but better control flipping. Remember to always test chicken doneness via texture and juice, not time alone—grill temps vary wildly!"
introduction: "Chicken cubes, chorizo slices, olives on sticks. The crunch, the snap when grilling, fat dripping. Fennel seeds crushed bring subtle spray beneath curry’s warmth and black pepper’s bite. Learned—crowding skewers kills the crisp edge, chicken steams, texture dead. Metal or soaked wood skewers, you pick. Heat blast first for sear, then slow indirect warmth lets meat plump juicy, no tough tricks. Lemon slices add that zing, sauce tzatziki or hummus smooth finishes or counterpoint. Fire up and listen for sizzle, watch edges bubble color. This dance between quick and slow grill makes or breaks it. Resting releases tension, reveals layers; juicy bits pop amid smoky scent of chorizo fat crisping on heat. Family gathered close, plates clinking—this one shows. No fuss, just sensory buzz around char and fat, salt and acid. Bright, rustic, approachable."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil about 2 ½ tablespoons coats chicken evenly, relaxing fibers. Fennel seeds crushed recently or dry—fresh wins, crush between fingers pinch by pinch. Curry powder—not overpowering; mild blend keeps spices balanced. Salt low to offset chorizo punch. Green olives always rinsed to mute cloud of salt and bitterness; if black olives on hand, swap but flavor deepens darker. Chorizo slices about 1 cm thick maximize crisp edges, render fat, add spice. Chicken thighs more forgiving, juicier; breasts leaner but need care, marinate longer, maybe add a splash of lemon if dry. Skewers soaked minimum 30 minutes if wood, prevents flame scorch; metal preferred for fast turnover but tricky to handle hot. Lemon wedges optional but best crunch and brightness. Sauces optional accessories to personalize flavor and temper spice or salt."
instructionsNote: "Layered marinade lets spices fulfill subtle fragrance without overpowering chicken or chorizo. Mix chicken pieces in oil and spices thoroughly for uniform flavor; marinate location cool and covered 20 minutes if time allows—waiting builds depth. Skewering sequence keeps moisture intact—alternate chicken, chorizo, olive, through dense stack, no tight squeeze. Grill setup critical: start on high direct for 4 minutes a side to seal juices, hearing sizzle, seeing caramelize edges on chorizo and chicken. Shift to indirect heat to gently finish via residual heat; meat firms up, juices clear (test by poking with tongs/ fork). Internal temperature 75°C ideal but tactile test beats times—look for springy feel, no resistance or jelly wobble. Rest skewers 5 minutes minimum to let proteins relax and absorb final juices. Serve with lemon wedges and sauces to contrast rich fat, salt. Grill maintenance keeps cooking smooth, no sticking."
tips:
- "Marinate chicken cubes well in olive oil and spices. Mix thoroughly or some bites bland. Crush fennel seeds fresh if possible. Marinate 20+ mins cold if time; if skipped, baste during grilling to build flavor steadily. Don't crowd skewers; gaps needed for airflow, heat penetration. Uniform chunk size keeps cooking even, no raw patches hiding."
- "Soak wooden skewers minimum 30 minutes to avoid flare-ups. Metal skewers heat quicker, flip faster but watch fingers. Layer chicken, chorizo, olive in pattern; alternating textures cuts fat risk and boosts surface area for crisp edges. Chorizo slices about 1 cm thick render fat properly, slivers tough or dry too fast. Skip overcrowding—heat tight spots fail to crisp, get rubbery or soggy."
- "Start grilling on high direct heat—listen for sizzle, see edges caramelize. Four minutes a side usually seals juices, forms crust from chorizo fat. Then shift to cooler indirect heat. Close lid to trap aroma and finish cooking gentle. Touch test chicken: springy, firm with slight bounce, no raw resistance, juice clear, no pink sheen. Thermometer 75°C guide only, hands generally better here."
- "Rest skewers 5+ minutes post grill on tray or board. Proteins relax, juices redistribute inside meat chunks. Skip resting and fibers clamp tight—dry texture waiting. Serve with lemon wedges—bright acid cuts richness well. Offer tzatziki or hummus if you want cooling contrast. Grilled veggies or flatbread add heft, balance salt punch of chorizo."
- "Grill grate care critical. Oil grate with paper towel dipped in oil held by tongs before placing food. Prevents chicken sticking, saves peeling bits off grill. If worst case char or sticking happens, re-oil grate between batches. Wood skewer ends should be away from direct flame or wrapped foil to prevent burning. Keep grill temp steady by watching flare-ups or coal distribution."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid chicken drying out? a: Marinate enough. Don’t rush grill. Use indirect heat finish. Rest meat after cooking. Test with touch, juice clarity. Avoid over-flip or piercing skewers early. Baste if skipping rest."
- "q: Can I swap olives or chorizo? a: Black olives OK but flavor turns darker, salt changes. Quality chorizo matters; spicy or mild alters heat balance. Ground chorizo or sausage slices less crisp. Adjust salt accordingly. Try smoked paprika if no chorizo."
- "q: What if skewers stick to grill? a: Oil grate well each time, hold oil with tongs using paper towel, soak wooden skewers. Avoid moving meat too soon. Metal skewers easier but hot. Clean grill often to prevent buildup. Flare-ups cause sticking too."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, cover tight in fridge, eat within 2 days. Reheat gentle on pan or grill. Avoid microwave if possible to keep texture. Freeze if needed but best fresh. Grill again for crisp if soggy after chilling."
