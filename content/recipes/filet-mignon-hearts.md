ingredients:
- "4 slender carrots"
- "4 small parsnips"
- "4 salsify roots (optional substitute with white asparagus)"
- "1 medium golden beet"
- "12 small pearl onions, blanched and peeled"
- "50 ml (3 1/2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) wildflower honey"
- "1 pinch ground clove"
- "4 thick beef filet mignon medallions"
- "Vegetable oil for searing"
- "Butter for finishing"
- "=== Aphrodisiac Sauce ==="
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) butter"
- "2 finely chopped shallots"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) dry Madiera wine"
- "5 cm (2 inch) ginger root, peeled and sliced thin"
- "220 ml (7 1/2 fl oz) rich beef demi-glace"
- "4 ml (3/4 tsp) Dijon mustard"
- "Freshly grated nutmeg to taste"
- "Pink peppercorns, crushed lightly"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 175 °C (345 °F). Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper - prevents sticking and helps cleanup. Set aside."
- "Peel roots (carrots, parsnips, salsify). Cut lengthwise into two or three long batons depending on thickness - even sizing ensures uniform caramelization. Peel beet and slice into small finger-sized sticks."
- "Blanch pearl onions quickly in boiling water for 90 seconds - softens skin, rinse immediately under cold water, peel skins off with gentle pressure. Keeps texture intact."
- "In heavy saucepan, melt butter with honey over medium-high heat. Once foaming, add root vegetables and sprinkle clove. Don’t stir too much; let the veggies brown and caramlize on contact - about 8 minutes. Look for deep gold edges and faint crackling sounds. Stir gently, keep watching carefully, else risk burning honey."
- "Transfer caramelized roots onto prepared sheet. Spread out so they roast evenly. Slide into oven; roast 18-22 minutes until just tender but firm to bite. Test with tip of knife; should enter without resistance but still snap softly. Avoid mushy."
- "=== Aphrodisiac Sauce ==="
- "While roots roast, heat oil and butter in same pan used for veg. Saves flavor. Lower heat to medium, sweat shallots till translucent but not browned - about 3 minutes. Smell sweet onion aroma releasing."
- "Add ginger slices and pour Madiera. Let reduce briskly about 3 minutes until almost syrupy, stirring occasionally to scrape fond from pan - this rattles in those deep flavors."
- "Pour in demi-glace, whisk in Dijon mustard and freshly grated nutmeg. Season with salt, crushed pink peppercorns, and pepper to taste. Simmer gently 3-4 minutes until sauce thickens slightly but still coats back of spoon. Strain through fine mesh to remove ginger and shallot bits for velvety silkiness. Keep warm."
- "Heat a heavy skillet over high heat, drizzle oil with knob of butter. When foaming, lay down filet mignon medallions, leaving space. Sizzle should be loud and steady - quick sear seals juices. Cook 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, adjusting depending on thickness and preferred doneness. Resist poking meat; let crust develop. Season with salt and pepper just before flipping to avoid drawing out moisture prematurely."
- "Rest meat off heat under loose foil for 5 minutes - allows fibers to relax, juices redistribute."
- "Plate by stacking roasted roots in center with pearl onions nestled. Place beef atop. Spoon generous warm aphrodisiac sauce over meat and around plate. Serve immediately."
- "Enjoy contrasting textures; crisp caramelized vegetal sweetness with tender beef and spicy tangy sauce punch."
introduction: "Root vegetables lending earthy sweetness, melting slowly under a honey butter glaze. Beef medallions from the filet, seared hard edges, juicy center. Layers bursting with flavors from the bark of ginger and the fragrance of Madiera. Tried caramelizing roots too long before - ended with bitter burnt edges; now watch, listen for that crisp crackle, that golden glow, cue to shift. Sauce brings zing, complexity; not just red wine glaze but warm ginger kick and peppercorn crunch beneath. Beef resting—no punctures or press—before sauce bath. The plate looks painted with textures and color. This rhythm, this balance - where rustic roots meet fine dining technique. A dance in the pan and oven, no fluff needed. Pure, primal flavors with a stay-on-the-mind aftertaste."
ingredientsNote: "Use golden beet for sweeter, less earthy bite compared to red—keeps color subtle, plate lighter. No salsify? Swap white asparagus or omit - a mild missing note but won’t ruin caramel balance. Pearl onions often sold frozen - partially thaw and pat dry before blanching. Butter quality matters; unsalted with high fat content produces best caramel. Honey can be substituted by maple syrup in pinch but expect subtler floral notes. Beef medallions thicker than 3 cm? Adjust sear times and rest time accordingly. Mustard adds brightness, skip if unavailable or replace with whole-grain for texture. Pink peppercorns are a wild floral note; crushed black pepper’s ok but loses that distinctive pop. Keep ginger thinly sliced to release aroma fast but not overpower sauce."
instructionsNote: "Caramelization isn’t just flavor; it’s smell and sound too. Butter and honey bubbling, vegetables crackling softly indicates sugars maillard reaction active. Stir too much, lose crust formation; burnt honey smells acrid—pull pan off heat if smell sharpens. Roasting duration best judged by feel—too soft means lost texture; less than 20 minutes and roots stay tough. Sauce benefits greatly from reusing pan from vegetables to capture all residual fond; saves washing, boosts flavor layers. Reduce Madiera briskly — skip too slow or too fast both dull or burn aroma. When searing beef, hot pan essential; cold pan leads to sweating not crusting. Touch test technique: gently poke - spongy means rare; firm means well done. Slicing medallions across grain is redundant here, but rest critical to avoid juice loss on plate. Always taste sauce season early; demi-glace and mustard vary in saltiness."
tips:
- "Caramelizing roots needs patience—keep heat medium-high but watch closely. Stirring too much destroys crust formation; listen for soft crackles, edges glowing gold. Pull off heat if honey burns smell sharp. Roots size evenness matters; slice carrots and parsnips same thickness or uneven cooking. Substitute salsify with white asparagus but expect milder sweetness, changes final caramel balance. Pearl onions blanched just right so skins slip off clean and texture stays firm. Butter unsalted, high fat content yields best caramel mouthfeel—avoid margarine or blends."
- "Sauce uses pan fond from veggies—don’t wash, all flavor sits there. Sweat shallots carefully—translucent, no browning or bitter notes. Ginger thinly sliced releases zing fast; thicker slices turn fibrous and overpower. Madiera reduces briskly—too slow dulls aroma, too fast risks burning. Whisk mustard in late to keep brightness, add pink peppercorn last for floral pop. Strain out solids for silkiness; texture matters here. Salt seasoning early to balance demi-glace saltiness; tastes vary bottle to bottle. Keep warm but don’t boil or sauce breaks down."
- "Sear beef medallions in hot pan, drizzle oil and butter—pan must sizzle loud on contact. No cold pan start or meat sweats and steams. Resist poking; crust development traps juices. Flip only once, season salt pepper just before flip to avoid moisture leak prematurely. Adjust timing by thickness; past 3 cm add 30 seconds each side. Rest under loose foil so fibers relax, juice redistributes—no pressing or juices spill on plate. Cut across grain unnecessary here, but rest essential. If using thinner medallions, shave cooking time carefully for tender feel."
- "Roasted roots spread evenly on parchment; crowding traps steam leads to soggly edges not crisp caramel. Roast 18-22 mins till firm but tender; test by knife tip resistance; should snap softly not mush. Honey-butter glaze caramels best under steady temp. If lacking salsify, omit or swap mild white asparagus—flavor shift but not fail. Use golden beet for less earth, sweeter note keeps plate vibrant not muddy. Salt roots lightly before roasting but don’t overdo—balances flavors but can draw moisture out. Pearl onions add sweet bursts, blanched frozen onions okay but dry well first."
- "Sauce thickness key; simmer 3-4 mins to coat back spoon light coat—not too thick or breaks. Pink peppercorn crushed lightly releases floral aroma—black pepper okay but loses that pop. Nutmeg grated fresh adds warmth, not spice heat. Use demi-glace from quality source or homemade; shortcut with reduced beef stock but lose some body. Keep ginger slices thin for fast aroma infusion. Sauce timing matters; prep while roots roast so sauce ready by sear end. Saves cleanup, layers flavor, enhances cohesion on plate—no leftover acidic or bitter notes."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap salsify with something else? a: Yes, white asparagus works best mild substitute, less sweetness. Might shift caramel profile but no disaster. Omitting salsify also okay; roots still balance. Adjust roast timing slightly—white asparagus cooks faster."
- "q: How to know when roots are done roasting? a: Look for firm but tender texture. Knife should enter with little resistance, snap softly. No mush. Golden edges show caramel start. Smell sweet waxy aroma. If edges darken too fast risk bitterness. Test frequently near end."
- "q: What if sauce gets too thick or grainy? a: Cut heat immediately. Stir gently. Add splash water or broth to loosen. Strain well to remove fibers. Avoid boiling once mustard added—can break sauce. Use quality demi-glace or lower heat simmer longer for smoothness."
- "q: How long can leftovers store? a: Roast roots 3 days covered fridge, reheat oven keeps texture. Beef medallions best same day, can store 1-2 days but risk dryness. Sauce stores well 2-3 days in sealed container fridge; reheat gently. Freeze sauce if needed but lose some freshness."
