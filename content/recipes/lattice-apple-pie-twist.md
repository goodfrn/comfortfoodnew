ingredients:
- "4 Granny Smith apples peeled cored thinly sliced quarter inch then halved"
- "3 Honeycrisp apples peeled cored thinly sliced quarter inch then halved"
- "½ cup light brown sugar"
- "¼ cup dark brown sugar"
- "⅓ cup granulated sugar"
- "1 tablespoon apple pie spice replace with pumpkin pie spice for twist"
- "½ teaspoon salt"
- "2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"
- "3 tablespoons cornstarch"
- "6 tablespoons unsalted butter chilled cut in small cubes"
- "2 unrolled 9-inch pie crusts allow to thaw slightly"
- "1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water for egg wash"
- "2 teaspoons coarse sanding sugar"
instructions:
- "Peel core slice Granny Smith and Honeycrisp apples thinly quarter inch. Then halve each slice for bite-sized pieces. Place all in a large bowl."
- "Mix both brown sugars, granulated sugar, apple pie spice blend, salt, lemon juice into apples. Stir thoroughly, coat every slice evenly. Set aside uncovered 1 hour. Juice will pool—do not discard."
- "Preheat oven to 410°F. Place 9-inch pie plate on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet. Saves oven chaos if juices bubble out."
- "Unroll and let pie crusts come to room temp while oven heats. Flaky crust needs gentle handling, too cold snaps or rips easily."
- "Line pie plate with first crust, gently ease to edges but avoid stretching."
- "Use slotted spoon to transfer apples to crust. Layer evenly, resist packing them tightly—they shrink releasing liquid more."
- "Add cornstarch to leftover juice, whisk till smooth no lumps or gritty bits. Pour slurry over apples in crust, helps thicken that bubbling syrup later."
- "Dot butter cubes randomly on top of apples. Use cold butter or crust won’t crisp well."
- "Cut second crust into 1.5-inch strips with sharp knife. Weave lattice pattern carefully, keeping spacing even. Crimp edges firmly to seal juices in but don’t compress dough too much."
- "Whisk egg and water for egg wash. Brush generously over lattice for golden sheen and sticky surface for sanding sugar."
- "Sprinkle sanding sugar over egg wash. Optional but adds crunch and sparkle. Watch it closely during baking—it can burn fast with sugar topping."
- "Bake at 410°F for 28-32 minutes. Look for bubbling juices peeking through lattice. If crust edges brown too fast, tent with foil carefully to prevent bitter burnt spots."
- "Lower oven to 360°F and bake additional 18-22 minutes until crust deep golden and filling thickened. Jiggle pie gently to feel if filling wobbles excessively—needs longer if so."
- "Cool fully at least 3 hours. Hot pie will seem runny but firm up as cools. Slice clean with serrated knife."
- "Serve slightly warm or room temp. Optional: dollop cinnamon whipped cream or vanilla ice cream for contrast."
introduction: "Peeling and slicing Granny Smiths and Honeycrisp—never skimp on firmness, flavor balance. Those tart and sweet apples crackle when sliced thin, release juice slower. Mixing sugars and spices with lemon juice releases flavors but beware soaking too long—you want tender apples not mushy. That hour waiting? Crucial. Juice draws out, sugars coat, and you get that syrupy gloss. Pastry needs love too; cold but pliable crusts don’t shrink under heat, no tears. Lattice top? It’s not just decorative; steam escapes, edges brown evenly. Egg wash seals, adds crunch with sanding sugar—skip sanding at your own risk. Bake hot first to set crust, then lower temp to finish cooking fruit without burning edges. Cool completely. Messing with a hot slice ruins everything. Experience taught me patience beats rushing every time. Food talks—listen to sizzle, bubbling juices, golden hue."
ingredientsNote: "Avoid thorny shortcuts—apples matter. Granny Smith for tartness, Honeycrisp for sweetness balance. No Honeycrisp? Fuji or Braeburn substitute. Swap brown sugars for dark molasses-rich sugar—adds depth. Apple pie spice is a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove; canned pumpkin pie spice works too; adapts well. Cornstarch thickens; potato starch can replace but expect subtle texture shift. Butter cold, cubed—skip margarine or melted butter, won’t puff crust equally. Pie crust is less forgiving when overworked; keep chilled, handle minimally. Egg wash adds gloss and assists sugar sticking; if allergic to eggs, brush with half-and-half or milk but crust won’t brown as intensely. Sanding sugar optional; coarse sugar crystals caramelize during baking, mimicking crunch a bit—regular sugar will dissolve. Lemon juice keeps apples bright, balance sweetness. No lemon? Apple cider vinegar tiny splash replaces acidity well."
instructionsNote: "Slice apples thin but uniform—texture depends on it. Thorough stirring coats every piece; be patient, uneven coating leads to pockets of under-seasoned fruit. That one-hour rest? Don’t skip. Juice pools; important for the slurry. Use a slotted spoon so you keep juices separate; dumping whole mixture drowns crust in sogginess. Slurry needs whisking to avoid lumps—clumpy thickening ruins pie texture, nobody likes thick globs. Dotting butter cubes across top gives place-holders of richness that melt into filling, creating silkiness. Cutting lattice strips can be fiddly; using a ruler or even your pie plate as a guide helps keep strips straight. Crimp edges firmly to trap juices, or filling escapes baking tray and oven panic ensues. Egg wash brushes easily, use soft pastry brush and don’t glob. Sanding sugar adds texture and sparkle; scatter it quickly but consistently. Oven settings vary—trust the sight and smell. Bubbling juices near edges and crust turning golden signals halfway point. Tent foil gently to avoid collapsing crust structure. Final temperature lowers so sugars don’t burn yet filling thickens nicely. Cooling cannot be rushed; cutting early yields soupy pie. Expect slight jiggle in center but set edges. Patience finishes the effort."
tips:
- "Slice apples consistently thin quarter inch, uniform size helps fill evenly and bake without mush. Use slotted spoon to separate juices before adding slurry. Too much juice = soggy crust. Rest apples an hour to let flavors marry, sugars pull moisture slowly. Juice pools a lot, don’t dump it. Important for thickening later."
- "Butter cold and cubed means it melts in patches, creates rich pockets inside filling. Skip melted butter or margarine—won’t give silkiness or good crust rise. Dabbing butter on apples last step before lattice keeps butter pockets intact. Good texture contrast."
- "Lattice strips tricky. Cut carefully 1.5 inches wide. Tip: use ruler or pie plate edge for straight lines; keep spacing even. Crimp edges firmly after weaving to trap juices. Watch dough closely; overhandle and crust tears or toughens. Dough chill time matters."
- "Egg wash isn’t just gloss. Mix egg with water, brush gently but fully over lattice to seal and help sanding sugar stick. Sanding sugar caramelizes, adds crunch. Use coarse grit, not regular sugar or it melts. Watch baking closely after sugar added, burns fast near edges."
- "Oven heat changes texture drastically. Start hot at 410°F to set crust and trigger juice bubbling visually and audibly—listen to sizzling. Then drop to 360°F to cook filling through without burning edges. If edges brown too fast, tent foil loosely but careful not to squash lattice or steam will soften crust."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent soggy crust? a: Drain juices with slotted spoon carefully. Don’t dump whole mix. Cook slurry clumps ruins texture. Let apple sit so juices pool and absorb sugar. Cold butter cubed helps maintain crust crispness. Keep dough chilled, handle minimal."
- "q: Can I substitute apple types? a: Yes peel and core Fuji or Braeburn if no Honeycrisp. Granny Smiths required for tart balance. More liquid apples may need extra cornstarch. Adjust thickener quantity little by little. Fruit ripeness changes juice release so watch baking time."
- "q: What if lattice crust cracks? a: Damp fingers seal cracks before baking—pinch gently. Overworked dough tears fast, chilling leathery dough helps prevent breakage. When weaving lattice, keep temperature cool and don’t stretch strips. Use full crust and vent slits if too complex, but lose caramel steam effect."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Slice cooled pie, wrap tight in foil or container. Room temp safe 1 day, fridge 3-4 days. Reheat gently to avoid soggy crust, oven preferable over microwave. Freeze slices wrapped well, thaw slowly in fridge. Pie textures soften over time, crisp returns slightly in warm oven."
