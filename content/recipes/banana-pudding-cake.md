title: "Banana Pudding Cake Remix"
slug: "banana-pudding-cake"
description: "A spongy yellow cake laced with banana pudding soaked into its core, topped with fresh bananas and whipped topping. Uses a yellow cake mix with a tangy twist by swapping water for coconut milk. Poking holes post-bake lets pudding seep in, making each bite gooey and rich. Vanilla wafers finish it off with a crunch. Chill long enough so layers settle without losing moisture or turning soggy. Balance sweetness carefully—the added touch of coconut milk lends a mild depth and tropical hint, making it more complex than standard banana pudding. Familiar yet refreshing to the senses."
metaDescription: "Banana Pudding Cake Remix uses coconut milk and a baked cake base with pudding soaked deep inside. Layers of bananas and whipped topping finish it off."
ogDescription: "Bake a yellow cake soaked with banana pudding using coconut milk. Layer ripe bananas and whipped topping. Chill 12 hours for texture that holds flavors."

ingredients:
- "1 1/4 cups coconut milk (can substitute with water or almond milk)"
- "1/2 cup vegetable oil"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1 package yellow cake mix (about 15.25 ounces)"
- "1 package instant banana pudding mix (3.4 ounces)"
- "2 1/2 cups cold milk (any kind works)"
- "3 large ripe bananas, thinly sliced"
- "16 ounces thawed whipped topping"
- "Vanilla wafers for garnish"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 345°F, not too hot or cake edges burn faster. Spray 9×13 pan lightly; avoid over-oiling or cake sogs up at edges."
- "In a large bowl, mix coconut milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and cake mix. Coconut milk changes texture; more richness, slight nuttiness. Whisk by hand for about 1 min. No lumps; batter should slide smooth and thickish but flow easily."
- "Pour batter in pan tipping to spread evenly. Tap pan once on counter to release trapped air bubbles. Bake between 27-30 min. Toothpick inserted near center should come out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Watch cracks; too many means oven’s too hot or overbake."
- "Right out of oven, grab wooden spoon handle or skewer. Poke holes all over cake while still warm—important for pudding to soak deep. Let cool 15-20 minutes but not cold; warm so pudding sinks in better."
- "While cooling, whisk banana pudding mix with milk in a bowl—use 2 min continuous whisking. Pudding can thicken too fast if left alone; stay ready to pour immediately. Should be pourable but not runny."
- "Pour half the banana pudding gently over cake. Use back of spoon to nudge pudding into holes, pushing down lightly so pockets fill but cake doesn’t tear."
- "Repeat with remaining pudding, smoothing top to create even blanket. Layer will seem runny but firm up refrigerating."
- "Spread sliced bananas in one layer over pudding. Bananas must be ripe but firm-ish to avoid mush. Slice thin to maximize coverage without sogginess."
- "Finally, evenly dollop thawed whipped topping on bananas. Not too thick or it overpowers; want some cake show through."
- "Decorate top with vanilla wafers. I press one cookie per serving spot; personal touch that avoids cookie hunting later."
- "Refrigerate uncovered or loosely covered for 11-13 hours. Twelve hours hit sweet spot for pudding to meld into cake without turning sludgy. Slice cold with long serrated knife for clean edges."
introduction: "Ever had a banana pudding that’s...boring? Me too. The mix, chill, and wait routine can get flat after a while. Learned that starting with a baked cake base changes everything. Instead of pudding dollops floating on top, the cake absorbs that pudding—deeper flavor, more texture. Tried it with water; next time switched water to coconut milk for unexpected richness, an underdog’s touch. The baking step comes first, but poke those holes while warm—that’s the unseen magic making pudding seep in, not trickle down the sides. Then layer bananas, whipped topping, vanilla wafers...crunch meets cream, silk meets cake. Patience helps here—skip the chill, and it’s messier sludge. Worth the wait. It’s snack table winner material, showing a layered depth most banana puddings lack."
ingredientsNote: "Coconut milk brings a subtle sweetness and creaminess; swap for water or almond milk if you want something lighter or nutty. Eggs add moisture and hold structure—don’t skimp. Vegetable oil preferred over butter for moist cake that doesn’t harden. Instant banana pudding varies by brand—adjust milk slightly if mixture seems too thick too soon. Whipped topping can be homemade or store-bought, but avoid overbeating if homemade; you want spreadable, not stiff peaks. Bananas: pick ripe but firm, avoid brown spots to reduce bitterness and mush. Vanilla wafers give crunch but soak fast; add just before serving. Baking spray should be light; too much oil pools at bottom and edges get greasy. Using a serrated knife for slicing chilled cake limits crumbling."
instructionsNote: "Baking at 345°F (instead of 350°F) helps avoid cracked edges and keep cake tender. Feel the top—springy, firm but not dry. Poke holes while warm, or pudding won’t absorb, leaving dry top. Mix pudding with milk briskly and pour immediately; let it sit and it’ll thicken too much. Pour half slowly, push pudding into holes gently. Rushing or poking too hard shreds cake. Bananas get mushy fast; slice right before topping, cover to prevent browning. Chill uncovered for a bit after topping—means less condensation, less soak. Twelve-hour minimum chill for pudding to meld into cake depth—not 5 or 6 hours. Better to prep day before serving. When cutting, warm knife gently under hot water, wipe dry, slice clean lines without dragging whipped topping. Vanilla wafer garnish prevents soggy topping patches and adds nostalgia. Leftovers—cover airtight, refrigerate, but wafer texture fades quickly."
tips:
- "Use coconut milk in place of water for batter; adds richness, slight nuttiness. If swapping almond milk, expect lighter texture. Oil beats butter here; keeps cake moist and soft instead of dense or hard on edges. Whisk mix gently; lumps ruin cake texture—batter thick but flow easily, no stiff lumps."
- "Poke holes immediately out of oven, wooden skewer or spoon handle works. Warm cake lets pudding seep deep; cold blocks absorption. Tap pan lightly before baking to pop air bubbles, stops cracking. Oven temp at 345°F—lower than usual—prevents edges burning, keeps crumb tender but cooked."
- "Mix pudding and milk fast, whisk 2 minutes continuous or pudding thickens too soon. Pour half slow, push gently into holes but don’t tear cake. Layer looks loose but set in fridge. Bananas slice thin, ripe but firm, no spots. Brown mush ruins texture fast. Add wafers last; they soak fast, best just before serving."
- "Chill uncovered or loosely covered twelve hours minimum. Less time and pudding stays separate, soggy top risks rise. Twelve hours melds flavors and pudding sinks into cake well; texture adjusts. Cover airtight after chilling to keep wafer crunch from fading. Using serrated knife slightly warmed under hot water slices clean edges without drag."
- "Banana pudding brands vary; test milk ratio, don’t let sit too long or too thick. Whipped topping homemade can be too stiff—spreadable texture key. Avoid heavy oil or butter spray; leaves greasy patches at edges and soggy bottom spots. Cake edge don’t dry out but won’t sog either with light prepping."
faq:
- "q: Can I use almond milk instead of coconut milk? a: Yes, substitute okay but texture lighter, less creamy notes. Expect less depth, slight nuttiness drops out. Batter consistency similar, whisk smooth no lumps. Watch baking time, almond milk might dry edges quicker."
- "q: Why poke holes warm, not after cooling? a: Warm cake porous, pudding seeps better, sinks in pockets. Cold cake blocks liquid, pudding runs off surface. Timing matters. Poke holes evenly but gentle. Use wooden skewer, spoon handle. Too forceful tears cake."
- "q: What if pudding thickens before pouring? a: Whisk faster, pour immediately on mixing. Thick pudding clogs holes, clumps on top. If thick too fast, add splash milk and stir fast. No waiting around once mixed. Improves flow and absorption during layering."
- "q: How to store leftovers with wafers? a: Cover airtight in fridge best but wafer crispness fades quickly. Store wafers separately if possible; add fresh before serving again. Cake lasts 3-4 days refrigerated. Whipped topping may weep; gentle gentle slicing helps."
