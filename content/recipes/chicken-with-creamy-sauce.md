ingredients:
- "2 large chicken breasts skinless boneless"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "1 teaspoon granulated onion powder"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil or avocado oil"
- "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "1 cup low sodium chicken broth"
- "3 ounces cream cheese cut into chunks"
- "1 tablespoon whole grain mustard"
instructions:
- "Season chicken breasts trimmed of excess fat then slice in half horizontally aiming for even thickness about 3/4 to 1 inch thick. Pat dry thoroughly and season both sides with salt black pepper and granulated onion powder. Let sit while heating skillet."
- "Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat. Add oil, swirl to coat. Shove chicken in skillet in a single layer leaving space if cooking in batches. Sizzle is immediate. Adjust heat as needed; aim for crackling golden crust without burning. Flip after 5-6 minutes when edges turn opaque and underside is deep brown. Cook other side another 5-6 minutes until internal temp reaches 165°F. Remove and tent with foil to rest and keep warm."
- "Turn heat to medium low. Add butter to skillet. Let it foam and melt completely without browning. Pour in chicken broth scraping up browned bits stuck from chicken. This is your flavor base. Low simmer create a savory aroma."
- "Add cream cheese pieces in small chunks stirring constantly. Use whisk or wooden spoon to smoothly incorporate as it melts into velvety sauce. No clumps. If it’s stubborn heat, lower flame to avoid separation. Texture thickens gently."
- "Whisk in whole grain mustard. Taste sauce - add salt and pepper sparingly because broth might add salt. Keep simmering low until sauce thickens enough to coat spoon about 2-3 minutes. Watch closely or sauce can over-reduce and become gluey."
- "Return chicken to skillet nestling pieces into sauce. Spoon sauce over chicken. Coat well but don’t overload or chicken won’t sear if reheated. If sauce thickens too much add splash more broth to loosen up to pourable stage. Serve immediately. Sauce thickens as it cools."
- "If pressed for time rest chicken under foil while making sauce. Do not skip resting - locks moisture in chicken fibers. Use tongs to flip chicken for even sear avoid piercing breast to keep juices."
- "Use avocado oil for higher smoke point or grapeseed if concerned about burning. Granulated onion powder swaps well for garlic powder adding milder sharp bite that caramelizes differently."
- "Can use crème fraîche or sour cream in final stages as twist for tang but add off heat to prevent curdling. Mustard changes personality so experiment with Dijon or spicy brown."
introduction: "Chicken breasts sliced thin always cook faster. Hands-on dry seasoning with salt pepper and granulated onion powder replaces garlic powder for slightly sharper roasted aroma in pan. The pan sauce draws from browned bits that unlock big flavor. Cream cheese for richness not too much just right. Whole grain mustard adds texture and bite different than smooth Dijon or prepared mustard. Resting chicken between sear and sauce helps retain juices keeping bites tender and juicy. Sauce thickness is a balancing act. Too thick it clogs the mouth; too thin means flavor lacks body. Mushroom broth substitution works well if chicken broth missing. Learned these tricks after burned sauce attempts and dry chicken frustration. Once you nail the heat control and whisking it flows effortlessly. Texture conscience and quick sauces have become my go-tos. On busy nights or when nothing else works you got this pan and simple bold sauce."
ingredientsNote: "Trim the chicken to remove any excess fat or sinew for cleaner bites and less smoking oil in the pan. Cutting chicken breasts horizontally ensures even cooking and thinner pieces that don’t dry out easily. Granulated onion powder as a swap to garlic powder adds a sweet sharp note that caramelizes deeper in the pan with less chance of burning compared to garlic powder. Olive oil has a lower smoke point so use avocado or grapeseed oil if cooking faster over higher heat. Butter added after chicken removal creates fond lifting base of the pan sauce. Cream cheese gives stable creamy body but can be swapped for crème fraîche for tangy finish with careful temperature control. Whole grain mustard adds texture and earthy sharpness avoiding blandness of plain mustard. Season sauce cautiously with salt because broth often has sodium, adjusting pepper balances spice level. These ingredient changes keep the pan sauce robust without overpowering the chicken."
instructionsNote: "Start by drying chicken with paper towels to promote strong crust formation upon contact with hot oil. Slicing breast half lengthwise makes for uniform pieces cooking evenly and quickly, no guesswork on doneness timing. Use medium heat and adjust to prevent sticking or burning forcing flips before crust sets. Use instant-read thermometer aiming for 165°F internal and visual cues like opaque fleshy color. Rest chicken loosely protected with foil to hold heat without steam that sogs crisp edges. Deglaze pan with chicken broth right after removing chicken to catch browned fond bits, swirl and scrape quietly worked with a wooden spoon or spatula. Melt cream cheese in simmering broth to avoid curdling whisking constantly until smooth sauce forms. Whole grain mustard stirred in adds polish and light grit. Keep simmer mild, stirring frequently prevents too thick clumpy sauce; add more broth if needed. Reintroduce chicken, coat in sauce, serve immediately. Sauce texture changes rapidly as it cools, so timing matters. Use tongs to gently coat chicken without tearing. Efficiency trick: prep all ingredients before heating pan to avoid stalls and overcooking chicken while waiting."
tips:
- "Dry chicken aggressively with paper towels first. Moisture kills crust formation. Slice breast horizontally for even thickness under an inch. Helps quick sear, no guessing internal done. Adjust heat mid-cook to keep golden crust, not burnt edges. Listen for steady sizzle, not popping oil. Heat control makes all difference. Rest chicken loosely covered—foil traps heat but avoids steam sogging crust. Timing matters: pull chicken at 165°F sharp, no higher or dries out."
- "Deglaze skillet right after chicken is out. Browned bits stuck to pan, called fond, hold intense flavor. Pour in broth slowly, scrape gently with wooden spoon to avoid scratching pan surface. Let simmer low, not boil aggressively or cream cheese splits. Stir cream cheese in chunks, keep whisk or spoon moving to avoid lumps. Lower heat if sauce grabs too fast. Mustard added last so flavor stays bright, grainy texture noticeable. Taste before salt; broth often salty."
- "Use avocado oil or grapeseed for searing; olive oil burns too quick at high temp. Butter added after chicken removal melts without browning to keep sauce base clean. Cream cheese acts as thickener and body but can swap crème fraîche or sour cream for tangy variation. Sour cream must hit off flame or curdling happens. Whole grain mustard adds grit and bite, Dijon too smooth here. If sauce thickens too much, add reserved broth by splash sparingly to loosen sauce for coating chicken evenly."
- "Rest chicken prevents juice losing vapor, keeps bites moist. Skip resting and risk dry fibers. Flip carefully during cooking with tongs to avoid piercing and juice leaks. Timing flips too early tears crust; wait for edges opaque, underside deep brown. Sauce texture changes quickly, so move fast plating. Sauce off heat thickens further. Prep ingredients before heat up to avoid stall and overcooked chicken. Watch skillet sounds—steady sizzle, not aggressive sputter means right temp."
- "Adjust seasoning cautiously because chicken broth contains sodium, salt sparingly. Pepper adds balance, but too much masks mustard or cream cheese depth. If pressed use mushroom broth for twist, richer earthy notes. Cream cheese melts slow on low heat, add small chunks. Thick sauce can become gluey—watch closely simmering time 2-3 minutes only. Spoon coating consistency tells all. Sauce thinner loses mouthfeel, thicker coats too stiff. Don’t overload chicken with sauce; restrain to keep crisp exterior."
faq:
- "q: How do I know when chicken is done? a: Look for opaque edges, deep brown crust underside, no pink inside. Use instant-read thermometer hitting 165°F. Listen for steady sizzle, not oil sputtering or quiet pan. Flip once edges firm. Resting seals juices. Don’t pierce breast with fork or knife until resting done."
- "q: Can I swap cream cheese? a: Yes, crème fraîche or sour cream works for tang. But add sour cream off heat to avoid curdling. Cream cheese provides thick creamy body slower melt. Crème fraîche adds punch. If neither, plain yogurt off heat could substitute cautiously. Texture a bit different but flavor still rich."
- "q: Sauce too thick or too thin? a: If thick add splash broth carefully to loosen. Too thin keep simmer gently longer to reduce volume. Thicken creamy sauce with slow whisk in cream cheese chunks. Avoid high heat or aggressive boil or sauce breaks. Stir often to maintain smoothness. Timing key. Watch texture coat spoon evenly, not dripping fast."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep chicken and sauce separate in airtight containers to avoid sogginess. Reheat sauce gently over low heat, add broth if stiff. Microwave or stove work but low temp keeps creamy texture intact. Chicken reheats fast; avoid overcooking again. Use within 2-3 days max. Freeze option possible but texture shifts."
