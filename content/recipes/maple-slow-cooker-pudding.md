ingredients:
- "450 ml (1 7/8 cup) maple syrup"
- "375 ml (1 1/2 cup) light cream 15%"
- "160 g (1 1/4 cup) whole wheat flour"
- "8 ml (1 1/2 tsp) baking powder"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) fine sea salt"
- "90 g (6 tbsp) unsalted butter, softened"
- "110 g (1/2 cup packed) brown sugar"
- "3 eggs, room temperature"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) milk"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) vanilla extract"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) bourbon"
- "1/2 tsp ground cardamom"
instructions:
- "Heat maple syrup and light cream gently in a small saucepan just to a boil. Watch bubbles form, smell that caramelizing sugar — don’t let it scorch. Transfer immediately to the slow cooker base."
- "In a medium bowl, sift together whole wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and cardamom. No lumps. Sets the structure and adds that subtle warm spice."
- "In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with brown sugar until fluffy but not melted — about 3 minutes on medium speed. Incorporate eggs one by one, beating well after each addition till uniform. No streaks."
- "Reduce mixer to low; add dry ingredients alternating with milk and vanilla plus bourbon. Start and end with flour. Don’t overmix or the crumb suffers. Should be sticky but smooth."
- "Spoon batter carefully onto the hot maple cream in the slow cooker without stirring or mixing layers. Use an ice cream scoop for even mounds spread out slightly. The batter will sink and float; it’s normal."
- "Lay two layers of thick paper towels over the slow cooker rim — keeps condensation off the pudding surface, preventing sogginess from above — then place lid firmly."
- "Set slow cooker on high and cook for roughly 1 hour 55 minutes. Around 1 hr 45 min, peek by smelling steam; expect a rich maple aroma with bourbon hint. Edges pull away, top should spring back when gently pressed, no wet spots."
- "If the syrup bubbles up too vigorously inside, lower the heat slightly or set a foil barrier above batter next time. Slow and steady wins here."
- "Turn off heat, leave pudding to rest 10–15 minutes before serving. Syrup thickens and cools slightly, pudding firms up just right. Serve warm or cold — reheats well with a dash of cream."
introduction: "Pulled off a few batches over winter, learned a lot about maple pudding in the cooker. The syrup to cream ratio is crucial; too much cream and it’s sloppy, too little and you get dry cake crust. I swapped in lighter cream (runs less but still rich), and whole wheat flour for a nuttier crumb — way better than all-purpose which felt a bit flat last time. Bourbon and cardamom give it a twist — small but noticeable warmth that plays off the sweet maple.  What’s tricky? That condensation. Tried placing foil first, but paper towels are easier and safer to keep the cake from sogging. Instead of waiting blindly, I smell for caramel hints and test edges. You want a soft spring, not sticky batter or rock-hard crust. The slow cooker’s magic is low temp, slow time. Trust your senses here — timing’s a guideline, not gospel. Once mastered, this is an unbeatable crowd pleaser, simple but with nuance."
ingredientsNote: "Whole wheat flour holds moisture better and adds a rustic texture but you can revert to all-purpose if you prefer lighter cake. Brown sugar brings a deeper caramel flavor than plain sugar; if unavailable, regular granulated sugar works fine, but decrease slightly. Butter must be room temp but not melted — otherwise creaming fails. Bourbon is optional but adds complexity; replace with rum or omit if kids eat. Cardamom is subtle but essential for background warmth — cinnamon or nutmeg can substitute but overpower. Maple syrup quality matters; use pure, unprocessed grade A for best aroma. I switched from heavy cream to light cream to balance sweetness and richness without heaviness. Milk temp should be lukewarm to help batter blend smoothly — cold milk causes clumps, warm milk accelerates cooking in the pot prematurely. Always sift dry ingredients together for even rising and avoid dense spots."
instructionsNote: "Bring syrup and cream slowly to boil over medium heat — bubbles should rise steadily but don’t let it brown or burn. Transfer hot liquid right into slow cooker bowl to start that bubbling base. Mixing dry ingredients separately prevents uneven pockets of baking powder that cause uneven rises or holes. Beating butter and sugar thoroughly traps air for lift; skip this and batter will be flat. Add eggs one at a time so the mixture emulsifies properly, prevents curdling. When alternating wet/dry, do it gently at low speed to avoid gluten developing too much; result should stay tender. Ice cream scoop measures consistent portions so cake cooks evenly, sinking just enough into syrup for gooey bottom layer. Two paper towel layers stop dripping condensation from ruining surface texture — tried foil first but it traps more heat, risking stuck topping. Slow cooker on high heats to about 90–95°C, good range to cook pudding without drying. At about 1hr 45min, test doneness by lightly pressing top — if it springs back without residue, it’s done. Resting after cook time thickens syrup and firms pudding for better slicing. Leftovers reheat well with splash of cream in microwave."
tips:
- "Heat maple syrup and cream slowly; watch bubbles rise steadily. Don’t let sugar brown, only caramel notes wanted. Pour hot into cooker quickly; start the bubbling base for layers without burning."
- "Sift dry ingredients thoroughly. Uneven baking powder causes holes and uneven rise. Whole wheat holds moisture but weighs down; sift well to keep texture light. Cardamom pops subtly in aroma mixed with bourbon."
- "Butter and sugar must be softened, not melted. Cream 3 minutes on med speed, trap air. Eggs added one by one; helps emulsify. Skip overbeating; crumb toughness comes from gluten forming. Low speed when adding wet/dry alternates keeps tender crumb."
- "Use an ice cream scoop for even batter portions. Layers sink and float - that’s normal. No mixing after topping batter on syrup; layering creates gooey bottom. Don’t stir or lose textures. Visual checks important as pudding cooks."
- "Paper towels over slow cooker rim stop condensation drip. Tried foil first - traps heat, risks stuck top. Towels absorb moisture; keeping pudding from sogging. Lid stays firm. Keeps surface texture just right even after hours on high."
faq:
- "q: Why use light cream instead of heavy? a: Runs less but keeps richness. Heavy cream can make too sloppy. Light cream balances moisture with syrup. Changes texture; important to control batter wetness."
- "q: Can I replace bourbon? a: Yes rum works or leave out for kids. Bourbon adds warmth, subtle complexity. No bourbon means simpler taste. Cardamom stays to keep some spice heat."
- "q: Pudding too wet after cooking? a: Check lid and condensation. Paper towels help most. If syrup bubbles too much lower heat. Foil traps heat, bad idea. Rest pudding 10-15 min, syrup firms up then."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Covered in fridge works well. Reheat with splash of cream in microwave or oven. Can freeze but texture changes. Defrost slow in fridge, reheat gently. Pudding keeps well if sealed tight."
