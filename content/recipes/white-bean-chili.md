ingredients:
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 medium yellow onion, diced"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "2 small jalapeños, seeded and minced"
- "1 can (4 oz) diced green chilis, drained"
- "1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth"
- "2 ½ cups cooked chicken, shredded or chopped"
- "1 cup chicken broth"
- "1 cup water"
- "2 cans (15 oz each) white beans, drained and rinsed"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "½ teaspoon black pepper"
- "⅛ teaspoon celery salt"
- "Sour cream, avocado slices, and chopped cilantro for topping"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add onion and garlic. Sauté, stirring, until onions turn soft and edges are translucent, about 5 minutes. Watch closely so garlic doesn't burn — burns turn bitter fast."
- "Add minced jalapeños; stir for a minute until their bright sharp aroma bursts out. The seeds? Toss 'em unless you want serious heat. Keep flame moderate to avoid scorching fresh herbs."
- "Pour in green chilis and vegetable broth. Add cooked chicken next; stir gently until chicken warms through — you want it tender, not rubbery or dry. Pour remaining chicken broth and water into the pot, stirring to combine."
- "Add white beans last; carefully fold in to avoid mashing. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and celery salt evenly. Bring the pot to a gentle boil; once bubbling, reduce heat and simmer uncovered. Let flavors marry for 25 to 30 minutes, checking occasionally that liquid doesn’t reduce too far — add water if needed."
- "Look for thickened broth, chicken fibers loosening in the mix. Beans stay fluffy, not broken down. Taste periodically for seasoning balance — adjust salt or pepper here if it feels one-note."
- "Serve piping hot in deep bowls. Dollop sour cream on top to cool the heat. Add avocado slices and sprinkle fresh cilantro leaves; bright green against creamy white and speckled chili—nice contrast visually and flavor-wise."
- "If prefer vegetarian, swap chicken for firm tofu cubes or extra beans; veggie broth already used boosts umami even without meat."
introduction: "Mid-cook realization: onion sizzling down in olive oil sets the scene noisy and fragrant. Garlic joins, tiny pops, sharp scent stretching through air. Jalapeños bring heat but not overwhelming—just enough. I learned quick: skip burning garlic or it's ruined. Chicken shredded, warmed gently with chilies swimming in broth, layers of broth build the base—water, veggie stock, chicken broth combo balances soft and savory nicely. Beans tossed in last, don't mash! This chili shows you how to read ingredients—translucent onions, broth gently simmering, smell deepening, tempo steady. Finger on the pulse, hand on the spoon. Toppings cool heat, smooth texture, fresh snap of cilantro brightens every bite. Easy meal, filling, and adapts well when missing ingredients or when mood swings spicy or mild. Discovered celery salt trick adds a little earthiness, subtle but key. Learn your pot, trust the smells, and watch textures to know when it’s done."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil is key for flavor and smooth sautéing onions instead of butter or neutral oils; it holds up to heat and adds richness. Yellow onions provide sweet, pungent base; avoid pre-chopped frozen onions—they sweat out more water and lose texture. Fresh garlic essential; minced finely. Jalapeños seeding cuts heat but keeps flavor; can substitute with poblano for subtler warmth or serrano if craving more fire. Green chilies in a can—prefer mild and smoky; swap out for fresh roasted if on hand but adjust quantity downward due to intensity. Using a combo of low-sodium vegetable broth and chicken broth tones down saltiness and adds complexity; grilled chicken or rotisserie work well here; leftover roasted chicken is prime. White beans canned and rinsed keep body and fiber—great to avoid cooking dried from scratch. Celery salt adds salty-earth layer missing from plain salt and pepper. Sour cream, ripe avocado, and fresh cilantro round the bowl with creaminess, cool contrast, and herbal brightness. If dairy-free, swap sour cream for coconut yogurt or omit. Pro tip: keep cilantro chopped fresh just before service for maximum aroma and color punch."
instructionsNote: "Start with hot pan, olive oil shimmering before throwing in onions and garlic. Onions must soften but not caramelize; a translucent look signals correct timing and sweet aroma. Garlic minced fine to release flavor swiftly but avoid browning—stir frequently. Jalapeño minced small disperses heat evenly—quick 60-second stir releases oils and scent without overcooking. Green chilies and initial broth warm chicken but adding more liquid in stages prevents over-diluting. Adding white beans last stops them from breaking apart and turning mushy; fold gently with spoon’s back to keep beans intact. Simmer at low-medium to develop flavors slowly; avoid rapid boil which toughens chicken and evaporates broth too fast—watch for broth level and bean softness. 25-30 minutes gives flavors time to meld; sense texture and aroma shifts more than clock. Salt and seasoning adjustments best done toward end to avoid over-salting early. Serving hot with sour cream, avocado, and cilantro balances flavor and heat—each element plays a role: chill, creaminess, freshness. Tips: If chili too thick, thin with extra water or broth, not more salt. If bland, add splash lime juice or extra celery salt. Using fresh chicken is trickier: cook it separately first to avoid shredding in chili. Tofu or beans make it vegan-friendly with few changes. Timing luxury comes from sensory feedback, not strict numbers."
tips:
- "Start olive oil hot enough to shimmer but not smoking. Throw in onions diced fine for sweet base; sweat until translucent without caramelizing. Garlic minced fine, add last in first step to avoid burning; garlic pops, tiny sharp notes fill air. One slipped into brown ruins flavor, make broth bitter. Timing key here, watch edges closely while stirring often."
- "Jalapeños take just about a minute stir off heat to release oils, bright aroma. Seed removal cuts down harsh heat but keeps character. Can swap poblano for less fire, serrano if craving more punch. Keep pan medium flame to avoid scorching jalapeños or herbs, aromas shift quickly, they go haywire fast if careless."
- "Add green chilis and veggie broth while still warm pan; helps meld layers. Chicken shredded and warmed gently—avoid rubbery texture by stirring, not boiling hard. Adding chicken broth and water in stages stops dilution and preserves broth depth without overwhelming saltiness. Important to keep liquid balance right."
- "Fold beans in at last to keep shape; mashing ruins texture, makes dish too mushy. Use a spoon’s back to gently combine; beans hold fiber, body. Simmer uncovered, low-medium heat for 25-30 minutes; watch for broth reduction and bean softness. Add water carefully if drying out, not salt, to avoid oversalting."
- "Taste late in cook time for seasoning tweaks. Celery salt adds earthy undertone not achieved by plain salt or pepper alone. Sour cream and avocado toppings provide cooling, creamy contrast to chili’s heat. Swap sour cream for coconut yogurt for dairy-free option, cilantro chopped fresh just before serving for max aroma and bright color."
faq:
- "q: How to stop garlic burning? a: Add garlic after onions softened, minced fine. Stir often. Garlic burns fast, bitter taste. If burnt, dilute with broth or restart pot if too far gone. Timing—watch, auditory cues popping help."
- "q: Can I use fresh beans? a: Fresh beans cook longer; canned ones rinsed preferred to avoid metallic taste. If fresh, soak well, cook extra to soften, may change broth thickness. Adjust simmer time accordingly to avoid drying."
- "q: Why does chicken get rubbery? a: Too high heat or overcooking. Add chicken shredded, warm gently stirred in broth, do not boil hard. Slow simmer preserves softness. Cook separately first if unsure then fold in last."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Cool quick, fridge airtight up to 4 days. Reheat slowly with bit broth or water to loosen thickened chili. Freeze in portioned containers, thaw overnight. Thickens in fridge; don’t add salt on reheat without tasting first."
