ingredients:
- "600 g ground pork shoulder"
- "70 g quick-cooking rolled oats"
- "15 g fresh thyme leaves chopped"
- "3 small garlic cloves minced"
- "180 ml fresh apple cider"
- "20 ml finely grated fresh ginger"
- "12 ml sea salt"
- "6 ml freshly ground black pepper"
- "25 ml vegetable oil"
instructions:
- "Mix ground pork, oats, thyme, garlic, cider, ginger, salt and pepper vigorously in a large bowl. Use hands or sturdy spoon. Let the mixture rest covered in fridge 4 to 8 hours. This firms mixture and deepens flavor."
- "Shape the meat into 8 evenly sized patties. Press firmly but don’t compact too much. Place on a parchment-lined tray. Option to freeze patties individually now for future use."
- "Heat oil in heavy skillet over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add half the patties. Cook undisturbed about 5 to 6 minutes or until edges look dry and underneath is deep golden brown, gently pressing to check firmness."
- "Flip carefully; patties should release easily. Cook another 5 to 6 minutes. Internal temperature should reach 71°C (160°F) or until juices run clear."
- "Remove cooked patties to paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining patties, adding more oil if pan looks dry."
- "Serve hot. Perfect with toasted English muffin, fresh tomato slice, leafy greens, or fried egg on top."
introduction: "Fatty pork, ground tight or coarse? Tried fine grind before but it’s dull. Coarse allows texture, bite. Oats soak up fat, keep moist; not flour that turns gummy. Used sage? Swapped for thyme - sharper, fresher, no bitter aftertaste that can sometimes kill subtle pork aroma. Ginger – bright punch that cuts through richness. Apple cider over juice straight from concentrate, for yeasty depth and slight tartness. Overnight chill is key, flavors meld, patties hold shape. Frying best on medium – fat renders slow, edges crisp, interior stays juicy. Flip once only — impatience ruins crust. Smell garlic and thyme mingling, sizzling fat crackle. Done when patties spring back gently, juices clear. Past tries undercooked, mushy texture, no crunch. These are breakfast staples, all day if you want. Freeze extra, reheat on skillet to revive crust. Pork love at breakfast level."
ingredientsNote: "Ground pork shoulder preferred for fat content and flavor but leaner cuts require added fat or risk dryness. Rolled oats absorb moisture, help binding without the rubbery texture of breadcrumbs or flour. Quick oats preferred over steel-cut for quicker hydration but old-fashioned rolled oats ok too. Thyme leaves sliced finely replace sage, for brighter, green notes avoiding bitterness streaks. Garlic adds background warmth, avoid raw taste through long resting. Apple cider original liquid; swap for dry white wine if needed, adjusting salt. Fresh ginger—powder lacks brilliance here, grate finely or mince to evenly distribute pungency. Salt amount adjustable post mix, salt is flavor anchor here. Black pepper fresh cracked, no preground dullness. Vegetable oil neutral; use canola, sunflower or light olive oil. No dairy or egg needed, oats and pork proteins hold patties firm. These swaps and notes are from playing with textures and flavor over years, improving mouthfeel and punch."
instructionsNote: "Mixing: don’t overwork meat or oats will release starch memory and bind too rigid. Vigorous mixing is for even distribution of seasonings and hydration but stop when uniform. Long rest in fridge is not just flavor developing but structural setup for frying. Patty shaping: uniform thickness needed, about 1.5 cm thick, too thin dries fast, too thick risks undercooked center. Use parchment-lined tray for clean freezing or resting, prevents sticking. Frying: wait until oil shimmers before dropping patties in. Medium heat over high prevents burnt crust with raw inside. Pan sound changes from sputtering to steady sear when fat renders properly. Don’t poke or prod too much, patty will crumble if fragile. Flip only when edges crisp and brown, gently nudge to check release. Internal temp with probe or juices clear when pressed indicates doneness; squishy means more cook time. Drain briefly on paper towels to avoid greasy cover. Leftover patties freeze well, reheat in pan or oven for crispness restoration. Resist microwave unless just defrosting. Great for sandwich bases topped with fresh sliced tomato, lettuce or egg; fat and seasoning stand up well to bread and toppings. Experiment by adding chopped fresh parsley or swapping thyme for rosemary, also good but strong. Adjust spice levels by cutting ginger or adding black pepper per personal heat preference. These notes come from countless breakfasts and late-night cravings. The smells alone tell you when to flip or pull from the pan."
tips:
- "Don’t overmix meat or oats. Vigorous but quick. Overworked meat turns tough; oats release starch, bind too stiff. Uniformity is goal. Rest in fridge 4 to 8 hours - not just flavor but structure. Chilling firms shape, helps crust form when frying. Use parchment for shaping, stops sticking, easiest freeze prep. Thickness about 1.5 cm; thin dries, thick stays mushy inside. Medium heat key. Oil must shimmer, not smoke."
- "Flip just once. Early flipping crushes crust, messes texture. Wait for edges to dry and brown, press gently to test firmness. Sound changes from sputter to steady sear when fat renders. Internal temp 71°C or juices run clear. Don’t poke too much, patty can crumble if fragile. After cooking drain on towels. Repeat adding oil if pan looks dry. Skip microwave reheating unless defrosting - lose crust crisp. Reheat skillet works best."
- "Substitutions okay but adjust. Thyme swaps with rosemary or parsley; rosemary stronger, cut quantity. Apple cider can be dry white wine but control salt after. Ginger powder lacks brightness, grate fresh or mince. Ground pepper fresh cracked; preground dulls punch. Quick oats preferred but old-fashioned rolled okay - soak better than steel-cut or flour, no gummy texture. Vegetable oil neutral - canola, sunflower, light olive. No egg or dairy needed, oats + pork proteins bind well."
- "Use ground pork shoulder for balance fat and flavor. Leaner cuts need extra fat or patties dry out. Oats soak fat, keep moist, bind without rubberiness like breadcrumbs. Garlic minced; long fridge rest kills raw taste. Patty shaping even for cooking consistency. Too thick undercooked, too thin dry. Waiting for skillet oil shimmer prevents burnt crust with raw center. Cooking sound shifting means fat rendering right. Flip when edges crisp. Don't prod too much - meat breaks down."
- "Freeze patties individually on parchment. Handy for later. Reheat skillet keeps crust crisp, oven okay too. Avoid microwave to keep texture. Use toasted English muffin, fresh tomato, greens or fried egg for serving. Fat and seasoning stand up well with bread. Spice levels adjustable. Cut ginger for less heat, add black pepper if want more. Fresh herbs chopped fine for brightness, not bitterness. Mix herbs but don’t overdo strong ones. Notes from many breakfasts, trial and error."
faq:
- "q: How to know when patties are done? a: Press edges, look for dry, deep brown color. Flip release easy means crust formed. Internal temp 71°C or (160°F). Juices run clear, no pink. Sound steady sizzle, not sputtering. Use probe or juice test. Don’t poke too much or texture suffers."
- "q: Can other herbs be used? a: Yes but adjust amount. Rosemary stronger than thyme, use less. Parsley milder, adds green freshness but no bitterness. Sage replaced here for sharper herbal note. Experiment but fine chop. Avoid overpowering pork aroma. Herbs affect final taste but balanced is key."
- "q: What if patties turn out dry? a: Check meat fat content first. Shoulder best. Lean needs extra fat addition. Don’t overwork meat, stops juicy texture. Thickness important; too thin dries fast, too thick may undercook. Cook medium heat, not high. Rest in fridge long helps binding and moisture retention. Oats soak fat, help moisture too."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool completely before fridge. Paper towel lined container reduces oiliness. Patties freeze well individually on parchment; prevent sticking. Reheat skillet or oven for best crust revival. Microwave compromises texture; use only if defrosting. Can thaw in fridge overnight or quick defrost."
