ingredients:
- "350 ml (1 1/2 cups) yellow wax beans"
- "350 ml (1 1/2 cups) green beans"
- "350 ml (1 1/2 cups) purple beans (or substitute extra yellow)"
- "40 ml (2 1/2 tbsp) avocado oil or vegetable oil"
- "1 shallot, finely diced"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "Optional twist: 5 ml (1 tsp) smoked paprika or chili flakes"
instructions:
- "Fire up the grill to high. Place a perforated wok or grill basket directly on the grates. No basket? Use a cast iron pan or grill-safe skillet."
- "While heating, toss all beans with oil, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika if using. Work fast, coatings should be even but light. The oil is key to blistering — prevents sticking and adds crispness."
- "Once wok is screaming hot, dump beans in, spread out to maximize contact and air flow. Stir every 2 minutes with tongs or wooden spoon to avoid scorching but allow skin to blacken a bit. Listen for crackles and pops. Feel the stems just barely tender but still snappy."
- "After about 9 minutes, add minced shallots and garlic. They’ll hit the heat and bloom aroma instantly, about 1 minute before finishing. Keep stirring gently but frequently; garlic burns easily here, so watch color."
- "Take beans off when you see blistered skins, some slight charring especially on yellow and purple beans. The sound softens; beans have gone from raw crunch to tender-crisp. Taste test final seasoning. Add more salt or a squeeze of lemon if things feel flat."
- "Serve immediately next to grilled steak, roasted chicken, or fish. If no grill, a very hot sauté pan with high smoke point oil works but skip the last charred bits."
- "Common mistake: crowding the pan dumps temp; beans steam and lose snap. Keep in a single layer or work in batches."
- "Swap ideas: green beans with slender asparagus tips, shallot for spring onion, smoked paprika for cumin powder. More oil yields silkier beans, but too much mutes char flavor."
- "Don’t overcook. The point is snap and smell, not soggy mush. Knowing bean readiness comes with watching surface texture and smelling the grill hoodie of the wok."
introduction: "Grilling beans directly in a perforated wok over hot coals or gas flames conjures a smoky crispness that’s hard to mimic in the kitchen. I’ve spent years tweaking times and oil ratios – too little oil and beans stick and dry out; too much, the char softens into oil slicks. Using a mix of yellow, green, and purple beans adds visual appeal and subtle flavor contrasts. The trick? High heat and constant stirring to trigger skin blistering without burning. Garlic and shallots are tossed in at the last moment to pull out a hit of aromatic punch. No one talks about shallots much, but their quick caramelization here gives a faint sweetness that balances the smoky bitterness. This side plays well with everything grilled – pork, fish, even tofu."
ingredientsNote: "I switched out olive oil for avocado or neutral vegetable oil because they tolerate the grill high heat better; olive oil tends to smoke and lose flavor. Yellow wax beans usually dominate the mix and bring a soft buttery note; purple beans add a faint earthiness. Replace the purple with more green beans if unavailable. Adding shallots versus just garlic is a subtle but game changing upgrade; shallots caramelize faster and don’t burn as swiftly. A pinch of smoked paprika or chili flakes introduces a welcomed depth and gentle warmth if you like. Salt is best added early to help tenderize the beans, but final adjustments are essential after cooking. Keep garlic and aromatics minimal to avoid bitterness during the fast high heat finish."
instructionsNote: "Getting the wok screaming hot before beans go in guarantees the crucial searing char crust. A less hot wok causes steaming - beans turn limp and miss that satisfying ‘snap’. Stirring often but gently keeps beans coated evenly, avoids black spots turning bitter. I find the smell of toasting garlic about 30 seconds after adding it is your best doneness marker. Don’t exceed a minute or it scorches and ruins the dish’s fragrance. When beans develop small blisters and start darkening irregularly, it’s time to pull them off. Undercooked means bland and woody textures; overcooked is mushy, loses crunch. Experiment on a small batch first if using a different bean type or oil. Also, if the grill runs uneven, move the wok frequently to prevent hot spots burning the beans. When plating, add a spritz of lemon or a pinch of flaky salt to balance the smokiness. This method gives you crisp, flavorful beans every time."
tips:
- "Never crowd the wok basket. One layer tops. Crowding drops temp quick; beans steam, lose their snap, turn mushy. I learned that after soggy failed batches. Keep stirring evenly with tongs; split batches if needed. High heat crucial. No basket? Cast iron skillet okay but skip last charred bits."
- "Toss beans fast with oil and spices before grilling. Oil coats and blister skins. I use avocado or neutral veg oil, olive oil smokes too quick. Salt early to help tenderize; add lemon at end if flavor flat. Paprika or chili flakes optional for smoky warmth but mild enough not to burn garlic."
- "Get wok screaming hot, almost smoking before beans hit. Blaze heat triggers that coveted char crust. Less heat means limp beans, no crackle sounds during grilling. Stir every 2 minutes, not constantly; enough to avoid burning, let skins blister unevenly. Garlic and shallots last minute, exactly about 1 minute before removing. Garlic burns fast. Watch color closely."
- "Shallots caramelize faster than onions, bring subtle sweetness that cuts bitterness from the smoke and char. Add minced shallots with garlic at the end. Timing is key. Too early, they burn. Too late, no aroma. Smell test is best marker - toasting garlic scent means shut off fire soon."
- "Substitutions work but affect texture and flavor. Purple beans add earthiness, replace with extra green if none. Green beans can swap with slender asparagus tips. Smoked paprika for cumin powder brings different but still warm profiles. More oil silkier texture; too much mutes char flavor. Experiment small batch if unsure."
faq:
- "q: How do I avoid beans turning mushy? a: Heat high. No crowding. Stir often but gently. Less heat steams beans, makes them limp. Use a perforated basket or cast iron pan but keep temp up. Quick cooking. Watch color, skin blistering. Pull off at tender-crisp, snap stage."
- "q: Can I cook without a wok basket? a: Sure, use grill-safe skillet or cast iron pan. Just keep stir intervals close, avoid overcrowding. Skip charred bits if sticking or too black. With less airflow holes, adjust cooking time; longer means watch closely for softness, no mush."
- "q: What if I don’t have purple beans? a: Replace purple with more green or yellow wax. Purple adds earthiness but green keeps crisp snap. Texture slight difference. If swapping, try to balance colors visually with beans used. May change final flavor layering slightly but overall pops still show."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, fridge in airtight container. Reheat in hot pan or grill basket with little oil to revive crispness. Don’t microwave if you want to keep some snap. Can last 2-3 days. No freezer recommended – beans soften too much on thaw."
