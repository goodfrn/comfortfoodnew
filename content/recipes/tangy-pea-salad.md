ingredients:
- "1 12-ounce bag frozen peas"
- "1 cup Greek yogurt, plain"
- "1 tablespoon dried dill"
- "½ teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 teaspoon lemon juice"
- "1 cup cooked ham, diced"
- "3 scallions, thinly sliced"
- "½ teaspoon kosher salt"
- "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Start by placing frozen peas in a colander. Run cold water over them slowly to defrost without turning mushy. Shake off water well, then spread peas on paper towels on a rimmed baking sheet. Press gently if needed to pull out extra wetness. Moisture is enemy here; soggy peas kill the texture."
- "Meanwhile, stir Greek yogurt, dill, garlic powder, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a bowl until smooth. The lemon curdles it slightly, brightens the earthiness of dill, takes the edge off yogurt’s tang. Adjust garlic and dill to personal taste — too much wrong here crushes balance."
- "Once peas look glossy but dry, fold them into yogurt mixture. No smashing. You want peas intact, each pellet coated but loose, giving a subtle snap when bitten. Next, fold in ham and scallions—these give that salty chew and fresh crunch. Folding, not mixing frantically, saves texture."
- "Cover and refrigerate at least 25 minutes. Don’t skip this. Peas soak up tang, ham tempers sharpness. Visual cue: peas settle, dressing thickens, aroma shifts from raw yogurt to mellow herbal perfume. Great make-ahead; just gently stir again before serving if dressing pools."
- "Trouble with watery salad? Happens if peas aren’t dried right or dressing too runny. Either drain longer on towels, or add a teaspoon of mayo or shredded cheese to thicken dressing next time. Dairy-free? Swap ham for smokey tempeh or toasted nuts, yogurt for coconut cream—watch flavor balance."
- "Leftovers hold well 2 days, but peas might soften too much after that. I learned to avoid squeezing peas with hands—more bruising, more water released. And dried scallions over fresh raw onion gives cleaner crunch, less bite."
- "Serve chilled. Bright green peas against soft white yogurt, flecks of green from dill and onion, cubed ham pinks. Flavor hits salty, tangy, fresh. No mess, no fuss, dependable side for picnic or potluck."
introduction: "Frozen peas not just for soup anymore. Bought into the thaw-and-toss method years ago, but back then, I ended up with a watery disappointment until finally nailed draining. Peas need space to dry, paper towels are lifesavers. I swapped mayo to Greek yogurt for less grease but tang that wakes everything up. The usual ranch dressing packet? Too heavy handed, too artificial. I prefer to control seasoning with dried dill and garlic powder; you get cleaner, real flavor pop. Ham swapped in not just because I like it, but it gives a crisp chewy bite against tender peas. Onion? Scallions. Less harsh, better crunch, fresher green aroma. Chill time? Minimum 20 minutes to let flavors marry—not just cold but melded, mellowed."
ingredientsNote: "Frozen peas can weep water fast if brushed off carelessly. Always thaw under running cold water; no hot water—peas get mushy fast. Drain well in colander, spread out on paper towels—don’t rush or the salad becomes a runny mess. Greek yogurt replaces mayonnaise here, cutting fat and adding tang; can swap back if preferred but expect heavier mouthfeel. Dried dill and garlic powder replace ranch packet—use fresh dill if you want but use double the quantity—dried is more potent. Scallions better here than raw onions for milder bite and crunch. Ham diced small enough to mingle with peas but thick enough to bite into. Lemon juice brightens dressing and helps yogurt keep from getting chalky. Salt and pepper season well but don’t overdo or you’ll drown the peas."
instructionsNote: "Start thawing peas right away. Don't skip spreading peas after draining—paper towel step makes all difference. Treat peas gently when mixing; crushing them destroys bite and looks sad. Mix dressing ingredients first so flavors meld well. Toss peas into dressing gently then fold in ham and scallions last—stirring last avoids bruising veggies. Chill minimum 20 min for flavor integration; 30 or more is better if you have time. Watch peas after chilling—they sink slightly, dressing thickens, aroma softens from sharp yogurt to mellow herbal. If salad looks watery, drain peas more or add a creamy binder like mayo. Hold leftovers in fridge tightly covered, best eaten within 2 days. I keep a small stash of dried herbs on hand—it saves store-bought ranch packets and lets you tweak flavors any time."
tips:
- "Frozen peas must thaw slow under cold running water. Hot water mush peas fast. Shake water off well, then spread on towels. Press gently for moisture out. If soggy - salad goes limp, no bounce."
- "Mix yogurt, dill, garlic powder, lemon juice, salt, pepper first. Lemon hits yogurt tang, dulls chalkiness. Adjust dill and garlic powder carefully. Too much crushes subtle balance; too little is dull. Fresh dill needs double amount."
- "Fold peas gently into dressing - no smashing. Each pea coated but loose, slightly glossy. Add ham and scallions last, fold lightly to keep chew and crunch. Stirring wildly bruises peas, turns mushy fast."
- "Chill min 20 minutes; flavor mellow. Peas settle slightly, dressing thickens, aroma shifts from sharp yogurt to quiet herb. Longer chill better if you have time. Don’t skip it - salad feels flat and raw otherwise."
- "If watery after chilling, pea drying likely off. Drain longer, press paper towels carefully before folding. Dressing too thin? Add small mayo or shredded cheese. For non-dairy version, swap ham with smoked tempeh or toasted nuts; coconut cream yogurt swap also works."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid watery pea salad? a: Dry peas slow under cold water, spread out on towels press moisture out. Drain more, don’t rush. Add binder if dressing too thin - mayo or cheese. Watch the peel, bruising releases water too."
- "q: Can I use fresh peas? a: Fresh peas sweeter but tougher bite. Blanch quickly, shock in ice water, drain fully. Peeling fresh also helps. Texture shifts - might need less dressing so no soggy mess."
- "q: How long can leftovers keep? a: Up to 2 days fridge covered airtight. Peas soften with time, salad gets watery. Stir before serving to redistribute dressing. Not for freezing; yogurt texture will change badly."
- "q: Substitutions for dairy-free? a: Use coconut cream or almond yogurt for tang. Ham swaps for smoked tempeh or toasted nuts for chew. Garlic powder, dill same. Adjust seasoning carefully as dairy-free bases differ in texture and tang strength."
