instructions:
- "Combine rice and water in saucepan, bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, stir once. Cover and simmer gently for 25 to 35 minutes. Remove from heat, let sit covered 6 minutes."
- "Mix fish sauce, hoisin, soy sauce, and rice vinegar in bowl. Set aside."
- "Heat oil in wok or large non-stick pan over high heat. Add garlic, ginger, sambal oelek. Stir quickly for about 40 seconds."
- "Add cubed chicken and peanuts. Stir-fry 4 minutes until chicken starts to brown. Season lightly with salt."
- "Toss in peas, water chestnuts, and scallions. Cook 3 minutes, stirring often."

- "Pour sauce mixture and cooked rice into pan. Stir everything thoroughly. Cover and rest off heat 6 minutes before serving."
introduction: "Brown basmati, not white. Earthy, chewy grains. Chicken cubes, quick fry. Garlic and sharp ginger flash in hot oil. Peanuts crackle in skillet. Water chestnuts add crunch. Peas frozen, toss fresh in pan. Scallions sliced thin, pop of green. Sambal hot, just a touch. Blend of four sauces, salty, sweet, tangy. Sear chicken golden, add mix. Rest covered, absorbs those flavors. No fuss, just cooking. About hour total. Take your time but move fast. Meals with layers, textures jumping. Not fancy words. Food. Simple."
ingredientsNote: "Use brown basmati for nutty, chewy texture. Water ratio adjusted slightly for fluffiness. Fish sauce, hoisin, soy – salty, sweet, umami balance crucial. Rice vinegar adds zing, replaces usual lime or lemon. Toasted sesame oil gives distinct aroma, more than plain oil. Garlic and fresh ginger finely minced for even flavor. Sambal oelek quantity halved; spice subtle not overwhelming. Peanuts dry roasted for crunch; no salt keeps seasoning in check. Water chestnuts swapped from canned bamboo shoots for freshness. Scallions and mung bean sprouts fresh, not wilted, lift dish. Frozen peas, quick blanch or straight in pan works."
instructionsNote: "Start rice early, simmer low and slow for even cooking. No heavy stirring once lid on, let steam work. Sauce mix ready before heat - speed keeps hot pan from cooling. Oil hot, garlic and ginger intense but don’t burn. Add sambal quickly. Chicken cubes small, cook evenly, toss peanuts mid-cook so they warm, release aroma. Salt only slight - sauces bring most seasoning. Veggies last, quick toss to keep crunch and color. Combine rice and sauce off high heat, cover to rest and meld. Resting important, seasoning infuses, moisture balances. Serve hot but not scalding, retain textures."
tips:
- "Start with good quality basmati rice. Brown rice for the win. Not all rice is the same. Rinse it first, get rid of excess starch. This helps keep it fluffy. Water ratio is key. Adjust based on rice type. Too much water? Clumpy. Just right? Perfectly fluffy."
- "Sauté garlic and ginger fast. High heat, quick action. Don’t let them burn, bitter taste. Add sambal oelek and stir. Spice level matters. Adjust to taste. Too hot? Tone it down. Mix and match, keep flavors balanced. Watch your timing."
- "Chicken needs to be cubed small. Even cooking is crucial. Toss with peanuts midway. Warm them through. Releases flavors. Season lightly at first. Sauces bring most salt. You can always add more. Veggies last, they need crunch."
- "Cover your pot after combining rice and sauce. Let it sit. Steams the flavors together. Resting phase is vital. Don’t skip it. Moisture balances out. Textures fade without it. Serve while hot but not burning. Enjoy layers and details."
- "For storage, keep in the fridge. Use airtight containers. Up to three days. Reheat gently to avoid dryness. Add a splash of water in the microwave. You can freeze it too. Divide into portions. Good for quick lunches. Thaw overnight."
faq:
- "q: How to fix overcooked rice? a: Add a splash of water, steam gently. Watch heat. Some say use fresh broth for flavor. Another method? Spread on a tray to cool, fluff with a fork."
- "q: Can you substitute chicken? a: Yes definitely. Tofu works well. Shrimp also great in this dish. Cook times change, be mindful of that. Adjust seasoning too. Use firm types for proper texture. Another alternative? Thinly sliced beef."
- "q: How to keep veggies crisp? a: Add them last for quick toss. Less time in pan. Steaming is also an option. Ice bath after blanching. Helps them retain color. Avoid overcooking, just a minute is enough."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Use containers with tight seals. Refrigerate within two hours, three days max. Reheat when ready but avoid excessive heat. Separate rice from protein for better results if possible."
