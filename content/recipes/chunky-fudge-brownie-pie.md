slug: "chunky-fudge-brownie-pie"
description: "A rich brownie baked in a flaky pie crust with chunks of dark chocolate folded in. Uses a partially baked pie shell, an egg wash for gloss and to seal crumb leakage, and a mix of baking powder with salt to keep the texture balanced. Melted butter carries sugar and vanilla flavors deep, eggs whipped aerate the batter. Baking at 350 degrees after par-baking crust ensures equal doneness without soggy bottoms. Edges tinfoil shield prevents burning. Finish with resting time for clean cuts. A twist on classic brownies, with slightly less sugar and chopped Walnuts swapped in for half the chocolate chips adds crunch."

ingredients:
- "1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust"
- "For egg wash: 1 large egg beaten"
- "6 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "1 1/3 cups granulated sugar"
- "1 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1/4 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon baking powder"
- "3/4 cup all-purpose flour"
- "3/4 cup chopped dark chocolate (replacement for chocolate chips)"
- "3/4 cup chopped walnuts (twist-replace half chocolate)"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 380 degrees F for par-bake stage. Line pie crust with parchment. Dump in pie weights or dry rice–not beans unless desperate (beans crack crust). Bake about 14-16 minutes. You want light brown edges, not golden yet. Weight removal now. Fork prick whole crust bottom and sides. Back in oven without weights for about 7-9 minutes more to dry it out and set. Take out crust and brush with beaten egg, thin layer, seals and gives shine. Cool a bit; brownie batter can hit warm or room temp shell."
- "Cut heat down to 345 degrees. Microwave 6 tbsp butter until melted but not bubbling hot. Stir in vanilla and sugar till glossy and shiny. Whisking sugar in hot butter melts it slightly, helps batter texture. Using stand mixer with whisk, whip eggs 1.5 to 2.5 minutes till pale and foamy—this lightness traps air, crucial for soft crumb."
- "Sift cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder together. Add slowly into eggs, blend on low speed just 1 minute. Avoid over mixing here or batter turns tough. Now pour hot butter-sugar mix into egg-cocoa combo. Fold slowly till homogenous. Add flour last; mix barely till flour disappears–no lumps but no overwork. Overmix and brownies get rubbery."
- "Fold in chocolate chunks and walnuts gently but thoroughly. Little pockets of dense chocolate and nut bits inside warm brownie. Use offset spatula to spread batter evenly into the prepared pie shell. If shell feels very warm, no worries—helps batter meld into crust evenly."
- "Bake 35-42 minutes total. Start checking at 33 minutes. Look for cracked edges and shiny center that jiggles slightly. Toothpick test: barely crumbs, not wet batter stuck. Halfway through baking, shield crust edges with tinfoil to prevent crisp burn. The egg wash seals crust but thin pie dough edges can char fast under heat."
- "Once done, pull pie out and place on wire rack. The aroma hits—heavy chocolate and nutty mix floating. Cool at least 20 minutes before slicing. Cuts clean when slightly cooled; any sooner results in gooey, fragile wedges."
- "Adjust sugar down to 1 to 1 1/4 cups for less sweetness; walnuts swap brings pleasant crunch and cuts bitterness. Butter can be browned for more flavor but watch microwaving closely."
- "If crust bubbles during par-bake, poke holes. For runny centers, extend baking 3-5 minutes and rely on jiggle cues over timer. If edges dry but center raw, lower oven temp by 10 degrees next time and bake longer. No pie weights? Use dry rice or coins wrapped tightly in foil."
- "Egg wash tip repeated: brush gently to avoid pooling. Pooling ruins flakiness. If crust looks overdone early, foil earlier than midway; crust thickness varies by brand and homemade status."
introduction: "Brownies in pie form. The crust plays the silent partner, holding the tender cake inside crisp and buttery. Tried skipping par-bake once—soggy mess. Learned the egg wash trick to avoid leakers and give shine. The batter mixing order matters. Eggs whipped airy, cocoa powders sifted, butter sugar joined hot for shine and texture. Chunks, not chips, for molten sweetness pockets. Tossed in walnuts for crunch and bitterness balance. Oven heat tweak keeps edges from biting too hard. Waiting to cool cuts clean slices—patient is key. This one’s for when straight brownies feel too casual. Pie, but fudgy."
ingredientsNote: "Pie crust must be prepped right. Use cold butter crust, avoid store-bought soggy bases by par-baking with weight inside. Beans make crust crack, so rice or specialized weights better. Egg wash seals and seals leaks, not optional. Dark chocolate chopped gives melt pockets, swap half with nuts or dried cherries for texture. Butter—not margarine—critical for flavor and mouthfeel. Don't skip sifting cocoa, clumps lead to bitter pockets. If missing stand mixer, hand whip vigorously eggs till frothy, it’s a workout but worth it. Sugar level can be tweaked for less sweetness. If walnuts unavailable, toasted pecans or almonds make great substitutes. Vanilla extract adds depth. Flour should be measured by weight or spooned gently—too much flour is brownie death."
instructionsNote: "Start with hot oven for crust prep, toss pie weights inside parchment to avoid stuck spots or cracks. Pricking the crust lets steam out in second bake step; skip this and crust bubbles up ruining filling surface. Egg wash brushes on thin, don’t drown crust. Watch that it doesn’t pool and make soggy spots. When melting butter, avoid boiling or browning by microwaving in 15-second bursts—hot butter cooks eggs if added immediately to cold batter. Eggs whip foamy is key—takes minutes but worth it. Folding in dry ingredients gentle keeps crumb tender. Fold chocolate and nuts by hand to keep clusters intact. Bake until crackled edges and slight jiggle center, look for shiny finish on top. Shield edges mid-bake to avoid burnt crust. Rest time mandatory; hot brownie pie slices fall apart. Leftover batter? Bake as mini muffins for dense treats. Use toothpick not timer for doneness; every oven varies."
tips:
- "Par-bake crust at high heat with weights inside parchment. Dry rice or foil-wrapped coins work better than beans which crack crust. Prick crust after weights to keep it flat; steam escapes on second bake stage. Egg wash brushed thin seals crumb leaks and adds shine—too much pooling ruins flakiness. Cool crust slightly before pouring batter; warm shell could cause gummy center or uneven bake."
- "Melt butter gently, avoid boiling. Microwave in short bursts, 15 seconds max. Mix butter hot but not steaming with sugar for glossy texture. Whip eggs 1.5-2.5 minutes separate, pale and foamy. This traps air essential for crumb softness. Fold dry ingredients carefully; overmixing leads to tough, rubbery texture. Cocoa, salt, baking powder sifted together helps uniform rise without bitterness pockets."
- "Chocolate chunks and walnuts folded in last, gently but thorough spread batter into shell with offset spatula. Avoid folding too hard or chunks break down. Bake at 345°F, shield edges mid-way with foil. Edges burn fast despite egg wash, especially thin crusts. Start checking at 33 minutes for crackled edges; center should jiggle lightly and toothpick test shows moist crumbs but no wet batter. Rest pie minimum 20 minutes for clean slice."
- "Adjust sugar 1 to 1¼ cups for less sweet variant. Walnuts replace half chocolate for crunch and bitterness balance. Butter can be browned but watch microwave carefully to avoid scorching. If crust bubbles during par-bake, poke holes with fork ASAP. If underbaked centers happen, extend bake 3-5 minutes relying on jiggle cue over timer. Modify heat next time if edges dry but center raw—lower 10 degrees and bake longer."
- "Use cold butter crust dough to prevent soggy bottom. Skip margarine—it dulls flavor and texture. No fancy stand mixer? Whip eggs vigorously by hand till foamy; takes time but works. Leftover batter can bake as mini muffins—denser treats but saves waste. Use toothpick not timer strictly; oven temps vary wildly. Crust thickness varies by brand—watch early browning and foil earlier if needed. Egg wash repeated: thin brush strokes only. Pooling causes patchy crumb."
faq:
- "q: How do I prevent soggy crust? a: Par-bake crust with weights, prick holes after weights removed. Egg wash seals edges. Use cold butter crust dough. Avoid soggy store-bought bases. Rice or wrapped coins better than beans for weights."
- "q: Can nuts replace chocolate chunks? a: Swap half chunks with walnuts for crunch and slight bitterness contrast. Use toasted pecans or almonds if no walnuts. Adds texture complexity, avoid all nuts unless allergic."
- "q: Why is center gooey? a: Underbaked center often from too fast high heat or warm batter hitting crust. Extend bake 3-5 minutes, rely on jiggle test not just timer. Lower temp 10 degrees next bake if edges burn first."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap airtight or use container, fridge best for 3+ days. Can freeze slices wrapped tightly to prevent freezer burn. Reheat gently to avoid drying. Room temp for a day is fine, but crumb softens."
