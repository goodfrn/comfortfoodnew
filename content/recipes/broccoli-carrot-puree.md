ingredients:
- "1 litre vegetable broth"
- "350 g broccoli florets"
- "1 large carrot, diced"
- "1 leek, chopped"
- "1 small knob fresh ginger (about 1 tsp minced)"
- "salt to taste"
- "pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "In a large pot, heat vegetable broth with broccoli, carrot, leek, and ginger."
- "Season with salt and pepper but lightly, adjust later."
- "Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low heat."
- "Simmer for about 20 minutes or until vegetables are soft and tender."
- "Transfer mixture in batches to a blender or use an immersion blender directly in pot."
- "Puree until creamy but a few small chunks can remain for texture."
- "Taste and adjust seasoning, add more salt or pepper if needed."
- "Serve hot, optionally garnish with a drizzle of olive oil or fresh herbs."
introduction: "Broccoli gets company here from carrot and a slice of leek. Vegetable broth swaps out the chicken for something lighter, fresher. Ginger nicks in for a bit of heat, nothing overwhelming. Chop up everything roughly, no fuss. Simmering until soft. Blending smooth or almost smooth; texture is flexible. That edge of warmth from ginger lifts the earthy greens and sweet carrot. No cream, no dairy. Just plant power simmered to homely thickness. Salt and pepper play the final note, not to drown but coax what’s there. Chill if you want, or straight off the stove. Easy, simple, good for a quick starter or light meal."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping chicken stock to vegetable broth keeps this vegan-friendly and lighter. The broccoli quantity is slightly bumped but with the carrot addition, the flavor balances bitter and sweet. Leek replaces onion for a milder, sweeter oniony-ness without overpowering. Fresh ginger brings a subtle background spice, warming but not sharp — peel and mince finely to disperse evenly. Adjust salt after blending as the broth can vary in saltiness. This can be varied with other veggies like zucchini or cauliflower if broccoli is scarce. Keeps well in fridge for a couple of days, tastes better reheated with a splash of broth or water."
instructionsNote: "Bring broth and vegetables to a boil first, then lower heat — gentle simmer extracts flavor without breaking down texture too violently. Cooking for about 20-25 minutes will soften the broccoli and carrot enough for blending. Using a blender in batches avoids splashes, but immersion blenders make it easier directly in pot. Blend until mostly smooth but leaving some small bits can give texture and interest. After blending, taste carefully before adding salt and pepper again — seasoning can get muted or enhanced after blending. Serve immediately or cool quickly and refrigerate. Garnish with olive oil, fresh herbs like parsley or chives for extra color and flavor punch."
tips:
- "Chop broccoli, carrots, leeks unevenly. Don’t stress on perfect cuts. More texture. Less uniformity adds charm. Use fresh ginger. Peel it fine."
- "Adjust seasoning before serving. Broth varies in salt. Remember? Taste after you blend. Go light, then add more. Avoid salting too much too early."
- "Simmer gently. It extracts flavors better. No need for boiling hard. Soft vegetables make for smooth puree. 20 minutes max, but check."
- "Experiment with different vegetables. If broccoli is scarce, swap it out. Zucchini, cauliflower work. Change things up based on what’s fresh."
- "Store it right. Fridge for a few days. Keep it in an airtight container. Or freeze in portions for future meals. Just add liquid when reheating."
faq:
- "q: How to make it thicker? a: Cook longer. Let it simmer. Or add less broth to begin with. It thickens when cooled. Adjust as needed."
- "q: What to serve with this? a: Bread works great. Pair it with a salad. Or a sprinkle of nuts on top for crunch. Options are diverse."
- "q: Can I add protein? a: Absolutely. Beans, lentils work. Or tofu cubes blended in. Give it substance if desired. Check balances in taste."
- "q: How long does it last in the fridge? a: About 3-4 days if kept sealed. Reheat gently, add splash of broth if too thick. Keep simple."
