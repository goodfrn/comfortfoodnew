description: "A hearty salad balancing smoky diced guanciale and sautéed oyster mushrooms tossed with tender green lentils and crisp-tender asparagus pieces. Baby spinach leaves mingle through a tangy dressing made with apple cider vinegar, mild honey, and whole grain mustard. The pancetta substitute adds texture; oyster mushrooms lend an earthy chew contrasting the vegetables. Simple, rustic, packed with layers of flavor. Salting at the right stage crucial. Cool asparagus quickly to retain snap. Emphasis on sensory cues—fat rendered to crackling edges, mushrooms browning deeply but not drying. Dressing emulsified smoothly with gentle whisking. No tricky dressings here. Fork-tender lentils hold their shape, not mushy. Salt and pepper to balance. A midday staple with guts, no frills."

ingredients:
- "150 g diced guanciale about 1/2 cm thick"
- "220 g oyster mushrooms quartered"
- "50 ml extra virgin olive oil"
- "40 ml apple cider vinegar"
- "12 ml mild honey"
- "12 ml whole grain mustard"
- "1 can 540 ml green lentils rinsed drained"
- "Half bunch slender asparagus cooked crisp-tender cut in 2-3 pieces"
- "1 liter baby spinach leaves"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat 25 ml olive oil in large skillet over med-high. Toss in guanciale diced—listen to fat sputter, edges tighten, and crisp up to golden-bronze. Remove with slotted spoon. Important to not burn—smoke means too hot."
- "Add mushrooms to same pan, low heat. Stir often to coax out moisture, developing rich mahogany coloring. Mushrooms should be soft but hold shape—about 8 minutes. Drain excess fat if excessive but keep a bit for flavor."
- "In mixing bowl, whisk remaining 25 ml olive oil, apple cider vinegar, honey, and whole grain mustard till emulsified. Dressing needs balance—too sharp vinegar kills sweetness; too sweet dulls mustard punch."
- "Combine cooled guanciale, mushrooms, drained lentils, asparagus, and spinach. Fold gently to avoid crushing spinach. Dress with vinaigrette. Taste for salt pepper; lentils absorb seasoning so adjust accordingly."
- "Chill briefly if possible—letting flavors mingle quiets acidity and rounds edges. Serve room temp for best taste."
- "Note: if no guanciale, thick-cut pancetta or smoky bacon works but drain well to avoid sogginess. Oyster mushrooms swap out button mushrooms but add better texture."
- "Asparagus: cook just until it gives a gentle snap when bitten. Overcooked? Mushy and dull. Cool immediately in ice water for fresh green color and firmness."
introduction: "Mind the balance between smoky pork goodness and fresh vegetal crunch—flavors layered, never colliding. Guanciale offers fat rendered slowly, searing the mushrooms to earthiness; green lentils bring chewy pop, soaking up tangy dressing. Asparagus delicate; mustn't overdo or dull the whole thing. Spinach soft but alive, folded right at end so it doesn’t wilt to gray mush. Honey, whole grain mustard—a dressing that’s not just tang but a little sweet counterpoint. Learned quickly to toss salad gently—too aggressive, and baby spinach breaks down, ruins texture. This salad’s a midweek salvation, not a fussy plate—but watch your salt, timing, and heat, or it falls flat. The real trick’s in emulsifying the vinaigrette with honey and mustard—the glue. Learned the hard way, a dull dressing can kill the vibe instantly."
ingredientsNote: "Guanciale is the backbone of this salad’s flavor—rich, fatty, porky, and melts into the mushrooms. Substitute thick-cut pancetta or smoky slab bacon for different but similar effect; avoid lean meats that dry out. Oyster mushrooms add a chewy texture, contrasting the softness of lentils. Standard button mushrooms lack this bite but are acceptable. Lentils should be green/puy type that hold shape, canned for convenience but rinse thoroughly to remove excess salt and brine. Asparagus needs precise timing—overcook, and you lose the snap and vibrant color. Use apple cider vinegar for acidity, subbing white balsamic if unavailable. Whole grain mustard gives texture and mild heat; Dijon is too sharp. Honey softens acidity but use sparingly to avoid cloying sweetness. Olive oil should be good quality but standard extra virgin enough—too strong masks flavors. Baby spinach is best fresh; consider a mix with arugula for pepper notes if you want a twist."
instructionsNote: "Rendering guanciale fat properly is key—you want crackling edges but no burnt bits. Listen to the spit and smell the aroma; turn heat down if smoking. Mushrooms should be sautéed low and slow after pork to absorb flavors—don’t rush. Let ingredients cool a bit or spinach wilts on contact. Emulsifying the dressing well changes mouthfeel; mix vinegar, honey, and mustard first before adding oil gradually, using a whisk or fork. Toss the greens last to preserve their delicate texture—fold not stir. Season in stages: rely on dressing’s salt but season lentils lightly before combining. Chilling salad briefly blends flavors and softens mustard’s bite, but resist leaving too long—the asparagus loses texture. If pressed for time, ensure cool asparagus by rinsing under cold water immediately after cooking. Store leftovers airtight, but spinach wilts quickly; better fresh."
tips:
- "Render guanciale fat slowly; listen sharp spit crackle sounds. Edges tighten and crisp bronze. No smoke or burn allowed, turn heat down fast if needed. Slotted spoon helps remove clean, leaving fat behind. This fat flavors mushrooms, so keep some but drain excess if pool forms. Timing crucial, watch color not too dark anywhere."
- "Mushrooms go in same pan, reduce heat low. Stir often but gently, coax moisture out without drying. Color should deepen deep mahogany, rich warm tone, not wet or soggy. About eight minutes works if pan not crowded. Soft but keep shape, no mush. Draining fat depends on how much released; too much feels oily, keep taste, no grease puddle."
- "When whisking dressing, add vinegar honey mustard first. Watch acid balance: too much vinegar kills honey sweetness; reverse dulls mustard. Add oil slowly while whisking to get emulsified mix, thick but pourable. Use good quality extra virgin olive oil but nothing too strong or it masks flavors underneath. Whisk or fork works best, slow drizzle of oil."
- "Asparagus timing—cook until bite snaps crisp but tender, no mush. Immediately plunge in ice water to halt cooking, fix color bright green crisp snap. Overcook means dull color and limp texture. Cut into 2-3 sections for evenness. Don’t skip cooling step, important to lock texture before folding."
- "Salad toss last step; cooled guanciale, mushrooms, lentils and asparagus first. Fold in baby spinach gently, no stirring or bruising leaves, folds keep freshness alive. Season layering salt: light on lentils previously, then taste salad with dressing, add black pepper fresh grind. Dress then chill briefly to let acidity calm but not long or lose asparagus snap."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap guanciale? a: Use thick-cut pancetta, smoky slab bacon works too. Avoid lean pork like ham, dries out and loses fat needed. Pancetta removes some smoky edge but keeps richness. Try bacon if no pork, but drain well before salad to avoid sogginess."
- "q: How to tell mushrooms done? a: Colour deep mahogany, lack surface moisture slick. Mushrooms soft but still firm shape. Shouldn’t look shrunken or dried out. Listen for gentle sizzle fade. Too fast means too high heat. Low slow cooks flavors in pork fat better. Draining excess fat once or twice no harm."
- "q: Lentils turning mushy? a: Use green or puy canned lentils. Rinse thoroughly to get rid of brine and salt that messes flavor. Avoid cooking lentils fresh here, canned gives texture hold. Drain well before folding or they soak dressing too much get soft. Toss gently after seasoning, no rough mix or it breaks."
- "q: Storage tips? a: Salad best fresh same day. Keep leftovers in airtight container. Spinach wilts fast, so store separately or add last before serving next day. Refrigerate asap. If make vinaigrette ahead, keep it sealed, shake again before use. Don’t over chill salad, that dulls asparagus snap and flavors quiet."
