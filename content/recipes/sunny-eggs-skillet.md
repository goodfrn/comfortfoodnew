White set, yolk runny; seasoning with salt and freshly cracked black pepper. A hint of olive oil replaces butter to bring a different fat profile. Time in pan adjusted by a minute for the whites to firm without overcooking the yolk. Garnish omitted for clarity."

- "1 large egg"
- "pinch sea salt"
- "freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat a small nonstick skillet on the base of a fondue pot until warm."
- "Add olive oil and let it shimmer but not smoke."
- "Crack in one egg gently to preserve yolk integrity."
- "Cook on low to medium heat for about six minutes, watching the whites solidify and yolk remain soft."
- "Season with sea salt and cracked pepper just before finishing."
- "Slide onto plate carefully without breaking yolk."
introduction: "Eggs. Hot skillet. Slow cooking on a fondue burner. One egg this time, not two. Olive oil instead of butter. Why? Different fat, lighter taste, less saturated. The whites firm, yolk soft. Salt and pepper. No herbs, no extras. Simplicity. The kind of dish quick to make, when craving comfort. Minimal gear: a small nonstick pan, a fondue set top source of heat. Timing's crucial. Five to six minutes. Not too fast, not too slow. Watch whites turn opaque while yolk stays golden and runny. Different, easy, quiet. Just eggs, heat, seasoning working together."
ingredientsNote: "Switched butter for olive oil to change fat type, reduce dairy influence; 10 ml used to keep eggs from sticking while introducing subtle flavor variance. One egg only, cuts quantity by half, matches small skillet size and fondue burner capacity—less crowding means even cooking. No additional seasoning like herbs or spices to keep focus on essential flavors. Salt and pepper basics, freshly cracked preferred for texture and aroma. Ingredient simplicity means straightforward shopping, quick prep. Olive oil’s higher smoke point than butter suits fondue stove heat. Egg freshness critical when cooking slowly; yolk runnytiness depends on it. Skillet choice essential—nonstick recommended for ease with single egg and delicate handling."
instructionsNote: "Start by warming skillet on fondue burner gently. Heat olive oil until it shimmers but no smoke. Important: too hot = brown edges, too cold = sticky whites. Crack egg perfectly to avoid yolk breakage—slow, steady hand. Cook low-medium heat, about six minutes lets whites fully set yet maintains liquid yolk. Adjust time based on egg size, stove calibration; extra minute possible for more set yolk, less for runnier. Salt and pepper near end to avoid drawing moisture prematurely. Remove egg carefully using spatula, ideally one wide and thin to prevent tearing; plate immediately. Skipping butter means no browning flavor but lighter profile gained. Minimal seasoning keeps focus sharp. Simple, but timing and heat key to success. Quick cleanup if skillet nonstick and not overloaded."
tips:
- "Heat skillet slow, watch oil shimmer not smoke. Too hot burns oil look for light ripple no smoke. Skillet size small, fits one egg evenly spreads heat. Nonstick mandatory. Avoid crowding. Oil amount small, just coat. Helps slide egg out easy later."
- "Crack egg gently. One steady motion. Avoid breaking yolk. Use room temp egg better yolk integrity. Whites cook faster if cold shock. Fondue burner low to medium heat. Watch white edges, set but no browning. Time adjusted plus minus one minute for yolk runniness."
- "Season late. Salt draws moisture if early. Wait till very last moment before serving. Fresh cracked pepper two cracks or three adds aroma without overpowering. Olive oil fat type lighter than butter. No dairy influence here. Yolk stays silkier. Butter browns, olive does not. Watch pan temp accordingly."
- "Use wide thin spatula for removal. Slide carefully under egg edges. One piece integrity prevents yolk bust. Plate immediately. Egg freshness critical. Older eggs whites runnier, harder to get firmness without overcooking yolk. Ideally cooked 5-6 min on fondue heat. Adjust timing if egg bigger or smaller."
- "Skip herbs, garnishes, keep pure. Focus on basic elements: egg, heat, salt, oil. Quiet dish. Time and heat key. Little room for error if too hot yolk cooked through. Oil smoke point higher than butter so better suited for fondue. Cleanup easier nonstick with small amount oil. Minimal fuss."
faq:
- "q: Can I use butter instead of olive oil? a: Butter changes fat profile. Low smoke point. Watch closely or browning happens fast. Butter flavor richer but sticks sometimes. Olive oil better for fondue burner heat range here."
- "q: How to tell when egg is done? a: Whites opaque, set but not rubbery. Yolk still wobble if gently shaken pan. Timing tricky. Six minute mark average. Adjust plus minus depending stove calibration. No bubbles or browning edges wanted."
- "q: What if yolk breaks while cooking? a: Happens if crack careless or move egg rough. Cook faster whites first then yolk firm. Or poach instead for runniness. For skillet gently crack and don’t move egg once in pan. Also pan temp stable."
- "q: Can leftovers be stored? a: Stored fridge few hours fine. Reheat low temp skillet or microwave softly. Avoid overcooking yolk. Best fresh though. Quick meal, make fresh to keep yolk runny. Not good for freezing."
