title: "Beef Mac Skillet"
slug: "beef-mac-skillet"
description: "Ground beef browned with basic seasonings. Elbow macaroni simmered in broth till just tender. Creamy cheese and milk stirred in. Juicy diced tomatoes fold last, adding a bright note. Cast iron preferred for even browning. Butter brings richness, but swap olive oil if dairy a no-go. Salt, pepper, garlic, onion powders boost flavor layers. Drain excess fat cautiously to keep richness, avoid greasy. Pasta cooking time flexible—watch closely. Cheese choice can shift character, experiment sharp cheddar or smoky gouda. Simple weeknight meal, quick but needs attention at simmer. Timing depends on heat source and pan type, trust sight and feel over clock. A bit of liquid left in pan signals done pasta, no dry crunch. Stirring frequency matters—helps avoid sticking and ensures even cooking. Easy base for tweaks and upgrades."

ingredients:
- "2 tablespoons butter"
- "1 pound ground beef"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "1/4 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1/4 teaspoon onion powder"
- "1 cup uncooked elbow macaroni"
- "2 cups beef broth"
- "1 cup whole milk"
- "1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese"
- "1/2 cup drained diced tomatoes"
instructions:
- "Heat skillet on medium high. Melt butter fully, shimmering and bubbling. Toss in ground beef immediately, season with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders. Use wooden spoon to break up meat. Spread evenly, no crowding. Cook until rich brown forms on all sides and fat renders, about 6-8 minutes depending on heat. Listen to the sizzle drop off, that’s your cue. Drain excess fat carefully, a tablespoon or two of beef fat keeps flavor without slick grease."
- "Add uncooked elbow macaroni to pan with beef. Pour in beef broth, stir lightly to combine. Spread pasta evenly. Drop heat to low. Slow simmer now, lid off or partially on to prevent boil over. Stir pasta twice within the first 6-7 minutes, making sure no raw noodle pockets. Watch for broth to reduce slightly but remain visible, noodles swell and soften. Use bite test to check for al dente—tender but with slight chew. Total simmer time usually 8-10 minutes, varies with pasta brand."
- "When noodles look nearly done, lower heat further. Stir in whole milk and shredded cheese off the heat if possible to avoid grainy texture. Fold cheese gently until melted, creamy sauce forms. Immediately add drained diced tomatoes, fold through without breaking them down. Tomatoes add moisture and tang that contrasts cheesy richness. Leave in skillet for a minute or two to meld but avoid overcooking tomatoes; they turn mushy fast."
- "Taste for seasoning. If bland, a pinch more salt or dash hot sauce wakes it up. Let sit a couple minutes before serving, thickens as it cools. If too thick, loosen with splash more milk or broth next time. Serve scooped from skillet; leftovers reheat fine but can dry out so cover tightly and stir in splash water when warming. Cast iron gives superior crust and even heat, but nonstick or stainless will work with care—watch burning closely."
introduction: "Butter melting, sizzling beef chunks spat dancing under spoon prodding. Ground beef, seasoned, cooks stirring and breaking, brown and rich aroma fills kitchen. Fat slowly renders, shimmering pools form—a cue for draining, but not too much or dryness follows. Elbow macaroni throws in, dry and stiff, bathing in deep beef broth that bubbles gently over low heat. Twice stirred to soak, slowly softening. Pasta al dente—still slight bite—but moist, no crunch. Milk and sharp cheddar join the pan stage, melting creamy, thickening the mix with smooth cheesy heft. Juicy diced tomatoes fold last, bursts of red tang soften heat. Serving from cast iron retains heat, crusted edges hint at comfort food magic. Familiar, simple, but tricky balance of timing and texture. A one-pan solution that waits for intuition, not a timer."
ingredientsNote: "Butter anchors richness; swap olive oil or avocado oil for dairy-free option—adds earthiness but loses creaminess. Ground beef can be replaced with turkey or plant-based grounds if needed—watch fat content and add splash oil if lean. Macaroni choice matters: small shapes because they hydrate evenly and fit skillet easily. Broth intensifies depth; beef broth preferred for flavor but chicken or vegetable broth works in pinch, adjust salt accordingly. Whole milk brings body and smoothness; half and half can be richer but tricky to avoid curds with heat. Shredded cheese best added off heat or low to avoid graininess—sharp cheddar classic, but experiment smoky gouda or pepper jack for twist. Canned diced tomatoes add moisture and acidity, fresh tomatoes are too watery and may need additional simmer time to reduce. Drain tomatoes well or risk watery final dish."
instructionsNote: "Start with medium high heat to brown beef well—doesn’t brown properly, you get boiled gray meat and missing flavor. Break meat apart and spread so it’s worth hearing those faint pops and sizzles. Drain fat but don’t overdo or beef toughens. Add dry elbow macaroni and broth immediately after draining to start pasta hydration early, keep mixture spread flat for even cooking. Low simmer essential now; too high and broth evaporates too fast or burns, too low and pasta turns gummy. Stirring twice early prevents sticking but avoid excessive stirring which can break noodles. Watch visual signs: broth quantity shrinking but not gone, pasta softer but toothy, bubbles gentle. Fold in milk and cheese off or very low heat to ensure creamy texture. Add diced tomatoes last, fold softly to keep chunk texture. Adjust seasoning last. Let rest a couple minutes; texture improves as sauce thickens. Helpful tip—if pasta overcooks, stir in splash broth to loosen. If too dry, add liquid at end next attempt. Serve directly from pan for rustic vibes."
tips:
- "Brown ground beef on medium high heat—listen for sizzle dropping. Spread meat thin, don’t crowd pan. Fat renders slowly but keep some for richness. Drain carefully or end with greasy mess. Wooden spoon breaks clumps easy—no lumps or raw spots."
- "Add dry macaroni to beef fat then pour broth immediately. Spread pasta flat and keep heat low simmer. Stir twice in first 6-7 minutes—no raw noodle pockets hidden. Watch broth shrink but remain visible—pasta swells, soften carefully. Al dente means tender but slight bite. Bite test beats timer here."
- "Milk and cheese off heat or very low heat—avoid grainy texture. Fold cheese gently until creamy sauce forms. Diced tomatoes last, fold in gently. They add juiciness but overcooked tomatoes turn mushy fast. Drain tomatoes well to avoid watery sauce."
- "Butter anchors richness but swap olive or avocado oil if dairy intolerant. Ground beef can switch with turkey or plant-based—adjust fat, add splash oil if lean, still brown well. Macaroni small shapes hydrate evenly in skillet. Broth preference: beef best, chicken or veg works—adjust salt accordingly."
- "Cast iron gives crust and even heat but must watch closely to prevent burning. Nonstick or stainless okay with care. Stir frequently but not too much to avoid noodle break. Sauce thickens better resting a few minutes after cooking. If pasta too thick next time add splash broth or milk."
faq:
- "q: How to know when beef is browned enough? a: Look for rich brown crust all over meat. Not gray, no pink visible. Fat pools shimmer but not greasy slick. Listen for sizzle fade, meat spreads out, texture changes to firm chunks, not mush."
- "q: Can I use other pasta shapes? a: Yes, but smaller shapes like elbow macaroni hydrate evenly and fit skillet better. Bigger shapes need longer simmer, can dry out or undercook. Adjust broth volume too if changing pasta type or size."
- "q: How to fix grainy cheese sauce? a: Add cheese off heat or very low. Stir gently, melt slow to creamy texture. Avoid boiling after adding milk and cheese. Use sharp cheddar or smoother cheeses, experiment smoky gouda or pepper jack for twist."
- "q: How best to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, store airtight in fridge. Reheat covered, stir in splash water or milk to loosen drying. Cast iron leftovers need careful reheating—nonstick easier. Consume within 2-3 days to keep texture decent."
