ingredients:
- "2 whole poblano peppers"
- "30 ml olive oil (2 tablespoons)"
- "180 g fresh or frozen corn kernels (about 1 1/4 cups)"
- "1 medium red onion thinly sliced"
- "2 boneless skinless chicken breasts halved horizontally"
- "150 ml sour cream (to replace cooking cream)"
- "150 ml chicken broth"
- "20 g finely chopped fresh coriander (plus extra to serve)"
- "1 ripe avocado sliced thin"
- "1 lemon cut into wedges (in place of lime)"
- "1 small jalapeño, deseeded and sliced rings (optional)"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 215 C (420 F), rack in middle position."
- "Coat poblano peppers with half of olive oil. Roast in a baking dish for about 18-22 minutes turning once, until skins blister and peppers soften."
- "Transfer hot peppers into a sealed container or cover tightly to steam for 10 minutes, loosening skin."
- "Peel charred skins off peppers carefully, discard stems and seeds. Slice flesh into narrow strips."
- "While peppers roast, heat remaining oil in large skillet over medium-high heat."
- "Add corn and red onion, sauté 4-6 minutes until tender and just caramelized. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Remove from pan onto plate."
- "In the same skillet, sear chicken pieces 3-4 minutes each side until golden brown, season with salt and pepper, remove and keep warm."
- "In a small blender or food processor, purée sour cream, chicken broth, coriander, and half of the roasted poblanos until smooth."
- "Pour sauce back into skillet, bring to light boil, reduce heat and simmer gently for about 4 minutes, until thickened."
- "Return chicken, sautéed corn-onion mixture, and reserved poblano strips to the sauce. Heat together for 2-3 minutes, ensuring chicken is hot but not overcooked."
- "Remove from heat. Serve chicken and sauce garnished abundantly with thin avocado slices, lemon wedges on the side, and optional jalapeño rings. Sprinkle with extra coriander."
- "Ideal to accompany with cooked white or brown rice to catch sauce."
introduction: "Roasted poblano peppers, their skins blistered, peeled and sliced. Crisp sweet corn rising alongside sharp red onion sauteed until transparent yet firm. Chicken breasts thinned and pan-seared fast on hot oil. Creamy sauce blended – sour cream swapped for heavier creams, lending tang. Chicken broth smooths, coriander freshens with a herby lift. Lemon wedges replace lime, adding brightness with sharper citrus. Optional jalapeño for kick—spicy rings to ignite if you dare. Rice to soak the sauce, avocado for buttery cool. Roasting peppers near high heat, steaming seals tenderness. Pan cooks chicken in little time, retaining juiciness. Sauce simmers to thick richness. Stacked layers of flavor. Mexican roots mixed with French creamy whispers. Simple tweaks change the game."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil reduced slightly to keep dish light, while still sufficient for roasting and pan-searing. Poblano peppers become smoky and tender after roasting and steaming, peeling is easier post-steaming. Sour cream added instead of heavy cream introduces subtle acidity balancing savory and spice. Chicken broth concentration adjusted to moderate richness without overpowering cream tang. Red onion sliced finely adds textural crunch and mild sharpness. Corn kernels bring natural sweetness and earthy notes, fresh preferred but frozen acceptable. Coriander fresh and chopped, adds herbal brightness, saving some to garnish enhances visual appeal. Lemon wedges for optional acidity swap lime's zestiness while maintaining citrus punch. Jalapeño optional for those craving heat; deseeding reduces fiery intensity but maintains flavor. Avocado sliced thin for soft texture contrast. Recipe altered in timing and measurements to suit slight modifications without losing concise cooking flow."
instructionsNote: "Oven preheating good to do at the start; gets peppers going right away. Roasting at 215 C for around 20 minutes until charred and soft. Turning peppers halfway gives even crisp skin blistering. Steaming in closed container after roasting loosens skins for easy removal, prevents drying. Cutting away stems and seeds removes bitterness. Oil divided—half for peppers to coat in roasting dish, half for faster saute of corn and onions in skillet. Sauté time managed to keep vegetables tender without mush. Chicken pounded or halved thin for quick sear times, 3-4 minutes per side to create crust while keeping moist inside. Blending sauce components until smooth ensures consistent texture. Sauce reduces for 3-4 minutes to thicken, careful not to boil dry. Final step reintroduces chicken and veggies to hot sauce, warming through just enough to meld flavors. Remove from stove before overcooking chicken. Serve immediately with fresh garnishes, avocado for creaminess, lemon wedges for added brightness, jalapeños for optional zest. Works well served alongside steamed rice to balance richness and collect sauce."
tips:
- "Roast peppers well. Skin needs blistering. Keep an eye. Steam creates easy peeling. Cut after cooling. Ensures no bitterness. Coat with oil. Adds flavor."
- "Season chicken. Salt and pepper on both sides. Keeps flavor during cooking. Use medium-high heat. Sear fast. 3-4 minutes should suffice. Keep warm after."
- "Blend sauce thoroughly. Ensure smooth consistency. Sour cream adds tang. Adjust broth to control richness. Adjust to preference. Taste along the way."
- "Sauté time matters. Corn and onion need tenderness. Just caramelized is best. Not mush. Watch carefully. Remove early to maintain textures."
- "Serving matters too. Garnish generously. Avocado adds coolness. Lemon wedges for brightness. Leave jalapeños on side. Allows control of heat."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Up to 2 days is fine. Reheat gently to keep chicken moist. Don't overdo it."
- "q: Can I use frozen corn? a: Yes, it's fine. Just thaw before. Sauté quickly. Don't overcook. Fresh is best but frozen works."
- "q: What if I want more heat? a: Add more jalapeños. Spice can change everything. Consider adding hot sauce too. Be careful."
- "q: Can I swap ingredients? a: Sure, experiment a bit. Replace sour cream with yogurt. Try chicken thighs instead. Flexibility works well."
