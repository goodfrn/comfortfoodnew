ingredients:
- "1 cup unsalted butter softened"
- "11 oz evaporated milk not condensed"
- "3 cups granulated sugar refined or raw"
- "2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips"
- "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
- "7 oz marshmallow creme substitute with homemade marshmallow fluff (egg white, corn syrup, sugar)"
- "1 cup chopped pecans toasted, swaps walnuts"
instructions:
- "===Prepare Pan==="
- "Heavy 8x8 square pan lined with parchment paper. Extend paper sides past edges 2 inches for leverage when unmolding fudge. Grease lightly under paper if worried about sticking. Setup before heat."
- "===Cook Sugar Mixture==="
- "Medium heat. Butter melts first. Add evaporated milk then sugar. Constant stir avoid scorching bottom. Use heavy-bottom saucepan for even heat, candy thermometer affixed. Target soft ball stage around 240 F, higher than usual fudge clue but necessary with marshmallow fluff addition. Watch temp rise not just timer. Mixture thickens, glossy sheen; bubbles become sluggish, big and slow before dip at stage. Slow your stir pace now but don't stop."
- "===Incorporate Chocolate=== "
- "Remove pan immediately off heat once 240 F hit. Add the chocolate chips fast, vigorously stir to melt chocolate fully into hot base. Mixture darkens, aroma deepens, chocolate slick covering spatula. Quickly dump vanilla and marshmallow fluff. Texture puckers, glossy goop morphs into fluffy yet dense mass. Keep folding until no fluffy chunks visible. You want a velvety shine without streaks. Then fold in chopped pecans, toasted to bring oil and crunch without bitterness. Change from walnuts due to stronger flavor preference noticed over batch #4."
- "===Set and Chill==="
- "Transfer fudge quickly to parchment lined pan. Scrape all mixture out or waste lurks. Tap sides hard on counter to shift air bubbles trapped. Rest 25-35 minutes at room temp frosting over but not stiff. Then, refrigerate minimum 3 hours until firm to melee cut test. Should snap clean with no gumminess. Use sharp serrated or chef knife, warmed if needed to slice even 36 squares 6 by 6. Keep refrigerated to avoid melty mess when serving. Store leftovers wrapped airtight to retain texture."
- "===Tips & Troubleshooting==="
- "Sugar grainy texture? Overcooking or stirring while cooling. Under-melted chips? Add splash cream or reheat gently off heat while stirring. Marshmallow fluff swap okay with homemade but avoid marshmallow spread with tiny sugar crystals—causes choke in texture. Butter substitute possible with coconut oil, but flavor shifts. If fudge soft, fridge longer or try chill in freezer 15 min increments. Best flavor post-chill but can sit out 20 min before devouring. Make sure pan lined well for folds or fudge fights removal."
- "===Serving==="
- "Crunch of nuts. Sweet marshmallow bite lingers with bittersweet chocolate finish. Dense to touch but melts creamy; breaks gently like good fudge should. Take your time savoring pieces with coffee or milk. Leftover fudge better after day or two if you can resist."
introduction: "Butter melts slow on medium heat, that first hiss of sugar dissolving. That aroma, toasted sugar and chocolate hit senses before even tasting. Learned that hitting soft ball stage just right—240 F here—makes or breaks fudge. Marshmallow fluff adds a chewiness but watch the texture carefully; too much stirring or undercooked sugar will ruin the snap. Chopped pecans (switched from walnuts) add more robust bite, worth the swap. Kitchen smells hit ceiling, thick glossy mass folds with marshmallow fluff melting in. Patience after pouring needed or fudge might crumble or stick. These things take time but teach more than measuring cups ever could. Slice with a warm knife, don’t rush or fudge drags. Always pre-line pan; fudge loves tannic stickiness."
ingredientsNote: "Butter soft but not melted before starting helps control melting pace. Evaporated milk key in fudgy creaminess not as sweet as condensed milk. Sugar can be refined or raw; raw may add slight molasses note. Chocolate chips go semi-sweet to counter marshmallow sweetness; dark chips overpower here. Marshmallow fluff homemade also possible with egg whites, corn syrup, and sugar boiled to the right temp—makes texture lighter but tricky. Nuts toasted gently on pan, cool before folding in avoid melting fudge base. Pecans alter flavor subtlety but stronger and more aromatic than walnuts which can sometimes taste bitter if over toasted. Handful or cup sized chunks for crunch without overpowering creamy fudge."
instructionsNote: "Key step: watching candy thermometer closely, hitting soft ball at 240 F signals intense sugar concentration for fudge to set well. Stir constantly to stop sugar sticking or burning. When adding chocolate chips off heat, stir till glossy, no lumps. Marshmallow fluff introduction transforms texture from grainy to luscious thick—fold carefully so you don’t lose airiness yet fully incorporate. Tap pan hard to release air bubbles trapped else fudge cracks uneven. Room temp rest not skipped; helps fudge settle before cold chill. Chill minimum 3 hours for clean cut. Knife warmed with hot water smoothens slicing fudge. Practice makes fudge; variations in humidity or stove heat impact final texture significantly. When fudge seizes or grainy, conclusion usually sugar crystals formed too early, try softer heat next time. Must be tactile as much as timed."
tips:
- "Butter soft not melted. Controls heat slow, helps avoid scorching. Use heavy-bottom saucepan, candy thermometer fixed in place. Watch sugar closely, 240 F soft ball is key, not just timer. Temperature rise signs: glossy sheen, slow big bubbles, thickening mix. Stop stirring too hard when bubbles slow or fudge grainy forms. Patience here beats speed."
- "Once temp hits, remove pan promptly. Chocolate chips added fast, vigorous stir melts quickly. Avoid lumps by stirring till glossy slick coats spatula. Next fold vanilla and marshmallow fluff swiftly; texture changes from grainy goop to fluffy dense mass. Fold in toasted pecans for crunch. Swap walnuts if bitter or too strong. Toast nuts lightly, cool fully before mixing to keep fudge stable."
- "Rest at room temp 25-35 min until frosting thin but not stiff. Refrigerate 3+ hours minimum before slicing. Don’t rush cooling; fudge needs to set firm. Sharp serrated or warmed chef’s knife makes clean cuts without dragging. Tap pan hard to remove air bubbles pre-chill or fudge cracks uneven when cut. Room temp rest overlooked causes crumbly fudge often."
- "Watch for grainy sugar texture. Usually from stirring while cooling or slightly overcooked sugar. If fudge too soft after chilling, fridge longer or use freezer in 15 min increments. Butter can be swapped with coconut oil, changes flavor noticeably. Marshmallow fluff best homemade or store bought without sugar crystals; spread will choke texture. Cream splash helps melt underdone chips gently off heat."
- "Keep pan lined with parchment extending sides 2 inches, leverage for unmolding fudge easy. Fudge loves sticky edges; paper prevents fights at slicing. Cooling aroma: toasted sugar, chocolate hits senses early, gives clue fudge nearing set. Knife warmed with hot water slices smooth, no dragging. Store leftovers wrapped airtight in fridge to retain texture, prevent melty mess."
faq:
- "q: How to tell when sugar reaches soft ball stage? a: Use candy thermometer positioned in pan. Watch temp hit 240 F, mix thickens, bubbles slow, sheen glossy. Timers unreliable, rely on texture and sight. Stir constant till right moment then slow pace."
- "q: Can I substitute nuts? a: Pecans swap walnuts easily. Pecans stronger aroma, less bitter. Toast nuts gently, cool before folding in cold fudge base. Avoid oily overtoast, which kills texture. Other nuts work but change bite and oil balance."
- "q: Why is my fudge grainy? a: Usually stirred too much while cooling or sugar cooked too hot or not enough. Sugar crystals form and ruin snap. Slow temp rise essential. Chill promptly after rest phase. Add marshmallow fluff folded carefully to smooth texture."
- "q: How to store fudge for best texture? a: Wrap airtight after fully cooled and sliced. Refrigerate recommended, holds firmness. Can sit few days, leave 20 min out before serving for softness. Freeze short term possible but thaw slower in fridge to avoid moisture condensation."
