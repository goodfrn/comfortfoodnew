slug: "ghost-marshmallow-pops"
description: "Soft marshmallow pops shaped like ghosts, coated with a dusting of corn starch and powdered sugar blend. Gelatin softened in liquid, then heated with sugars for a sticky marshmallow base. Flavored lightly with almond extract replacing vanilla. Sweetened with golden syrup instead of corn syrup. Black sugar gel icing eyes add spooky faces. Molds greased lightly for easy unmolding. Refrigerator chills harden marshmallows around inserted sticks. Coating mix prevents sticking and adds a powdery finish. Stored wrapped, shelf stable at room temperature."

ingredients:
- "Vegetable oil 20 ml (1 1/3 tablespoon)"
- "Gelatin 78 ml (1/3 cup)"
- "Water 75 ml (1/3 cup)"
- "Granulated sugar 105 ml (1/2 cup)"
- "Golden syrup 90 ml (just over 1/3 cup)"
- "Almond extract 3 ml (3/4 teaspoon)"
- "Powdered sugar 70 ml (heaping 1/3 cup)"
- "Corn starch 80 ml (1/3 cup + 1 teaspoon)"
- "6 long coffee or lollipop sticks"
- "=== Icing ==="
- "Water few drops"
- "Black gel food coloring"
instructions:
- "=== Preparation ==="
- "Lightly grease 6 lollipop molds with vegetable oil. Dispense oil with a paper towel for thin, even film."
- "Bloom gelatin by sprinkling over water in small saucepan. Let sit about 7 minutes until gelatin absorbs liquid and softens."
- "Add sugar to gelatin-water mixture, heat gently, stir constantly until sugar and gelatin completely dissolve. Remove from heat immediately."
- "Pour syrup into mixing bowl. Stir in golden syrup and almond extract. Using electric mixer, beat on medium speed until mixture thickens and becomes like soft meringue, about 12 minutes."
- "Fill molds with marshmallow mixture using a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip. Tap molds lightly to remove air bubbles."
- "Insert sticks through center of each filled mold. Chill in refrigerator 2 hours 15 minutes until firm."
- "=== Coating ==="
- "In shallow dish combine powdered sugar and corn starch. Toss marshmallow pops in mixture, coat fully. Shake off excess powder carefully."
- "Place coated marshmallows on wire rack lined with parchment paper."
- "=== Decorating ==="
- "Mix small amount of powdered sugar with few drops of water and black gel color to make thick icing."
- "Use small cone of parchment or tiny piping bag to pipe eyes and mouth onto each marshmallow ghost."
- "Let icing set at room temperature about 10 minutes before serving or storing."
- "Wrap marshmallows individually in wax paper or store in airtight container at room temperature. Avoid humidity."
introduction: "Ghosts. Marshmallow soft, sticky fingers from sticky syrup and gelatin bloom soaked in water. Almond smell instead of vanilla. Golden syrup gives a darker note, less shiny than clear syrup but deeper flavor. Molding into ghost forms by piping shapes that stay puffed. Powder coating stops stickiness, adds softness to touch. Black eyes. Creepy faces. Lollipop sticks hold them firm. Chill just right, not too long, or marshmallow will get dry. Easy peel from oiled molds, sticky enough to hold, not too sticky to make a mess. Keep wrapped—humidity is the enemy. Sit back. Bite into clouds of sweet. Halloween in your hand."
ingredientsNote: "Vegetable oil for greasing molds, use just a thin layer or pops stick too much. Gelatin needs exact blooming to fluff marshmallow. Golden syrup is swap from corn syrup; color darker, flavor richer, stickier. Granulated sugar amount upped slightly for balance with thicker syrup. Almond extract added for twist to vanilla—distinct aroma, sharp sweetness. Powdered sugar and corn starch blend for coating prevents excess limp stickiness. Without coating, marshmallows turn tacky fast. Use fresh ingredients; stale gelatin or sugars ruin texture. Black gel for sharp icing eyes, drops of water thin enough to pipe but thick enough to hold shape."
instructionsNote: "Start by greasing molds sparingly. Bloom gelatin thoroughly; it takes longer with golden syrup mix, 7 min instead of 5. Gentle heat ensures sugar dissolves fully. Beat mix longer; meringue phase softer and fluffier than stiff peaks. Pipe quickly into molds; mixture sets fast upon cooling. Insert sticks gently but deeply for stable hold. Chill 2 hours 15 minutes for best firmness without drying. After unmolding, coat marshmallows fully, shake excess off over bowl to catch. Decorating eyes with gel icing requires patience, piped small dots for creepy but cute eyes. Dry icing before storing. Use airtight container with folded wax paper. No refrigeration after coating to avoid condensation. Pop in candy jar or stand upright in glass filled with decorative stones."
tips:
- "Grease molds super thin. Vegetable oil spread with paper towel tiny layer. Too much, pops stick or soggy edges. Molds need smooth release. Insert sticks gently but center. Not too shallow or marshmallow falls off. Not too deep to stay put without cracking."
- "Bloom gelatin in cold water for 7 minutes. Watch closely. Underbloomed gelatin makes marshmallow dense, no fluff. Longer bloom suits golden syrup—thicker mixture. Use small saucepan for even heat. Stir gently to not deflate gelatin-syrup mix."
- "Heat sugar with gelatin mix low and slow. No boiling or caramelization. Dissolve completely or gritty marshmallow texture happens. Remove from heat right after dissolve. Timing key. Electric mixer speeds up beating. 12 minutes medium. Stops when thick but soft peaks appear. Not stiff peaks."
- "Coating mix of powdered sugar and cornstarch. Toss pops carefully, cover fully. Prevents sticky surface. Makes touch soft powdery, no wet tack. Excess powder shakes off easily better over bowl or parchment. Store coated pops in airtight container. Moisture ruins coating fast."
- "Icing black eyes need thick paste. Mix powdered sugar few drops water, one drop gel color. Piping bag or parchment cone works. Pipe tiny details fast before icing runs. Let dry room temp 10 minutes minimum. Avoid fridge. Icing sets hard enough to hold shape but not brittle."
faq:
- "q: Why bloom gelatin longer for golden syrup? a: Golden syrup thicker so gelatin hydrates slower. Needs full softening else marshmallow won't fluff. Seven minutes bloom beats five. Skip rush or marshmallow tough."
- "q: Can I substitute almond extract with vanilla? a: Yes you can but flavor changes. Almond gives sharp sweet aroma. Vanilla softer, more common. Adjust quantity slightly, almond extract intense. Also syrup taste differences. Golden syrup darker, deeper flavor than corn syrup."
- "q: Sticking issues after unmolding? a: Check mold greasing thickness. Too thin causes pops to stick. Too thick also sticky. Balance. Coat fully with powdered sugar cornstarch mix right away. Delays tackiness. Use fresh gelatin, old makes sticky too."
- "q: How to store marshmallow pops best? a: Wrap each in wax paper air tight container better. Keeps humidity out. Room temp only, no fridge to avoid condensation which dissolves coating. Cool dry spot ideal. Can stand wrapped pops upright for display but avoid crushing."
