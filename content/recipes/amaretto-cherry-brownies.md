- "Chop white chocolate finely. Heat cream with amaretto to just boil. Pour over chocolate, wait 1 minute, whisk until smooth. Cover, refrigerate at least 5 hours."
- "=== Prepare brownie ==="
- "Preheat oven 160°C (320°F). Butter 20 cm square pan, line with parchment paper leaving overhang."
- "Mix flour, hazelnuts, salt together in bowl."
- "In separate bowl, whisk eggs, chocolate spread, brown sugar, vanilla until uniform about 2 min. On low speed, add dry mix alternating with melted butter until combined."
- "Spread batter evenly in pan. Bake 30-38 min. Toothpick test: expect moist crumbs, not fully clean. Cool 25 min."
- "=== Chocolate crumble optional ==="
- "Line sheet with silicone mat or parchment. Mix butter, flour, powdered milk, sugar, salt until barely moistened. Break up into chunks on sheet."
- "Bake 7 min, stirring halfway, until golden and crisp. Cool 25 min."
- "Coat crumble pieces with melted dark chocolate. Spread on sheet to harden about 2.5 hours. Toss in cocoa powder after set."
- "=== Cherry topping ==="
- "Sprinkle gelatin on 15 ml water, let swell 5 min."
- "In saucepan mix sugar, cornstarch. Add cherries and remaining water. Cook stirring over medium heat until thickened. Remove from heat."
- "Purée cherries with hand blender. Stir in gelatin until dissolved. Cool before spreading over brownie. Chill 1 hour to set."
- "=== Dark chocolate custard ==="
- "Whisk yolks with sugar off heat until smooth. Slowly add hot cream whisking."
- "Heat gently stirring constantly, scrape pan edges, until thick and coats spoon back. Remove from heat."
- "Add chopped chocolate, whisk till smooth. Cool 25 min before spreading on cherry layer. Refrigerate 1.5 hours. Freeze stage optional."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Remove brownie from pan using parchment overhang. Trim edges to square. Cut brownie into 12 equal rectangles."
- "Beat amaretto whipped cream until firm peaks but still pliable. Transfer to pastry bag fitted with Saint-Honoré tip."
- "Pipe whipped cream over each brownie piece. Sprinkle with chocolate crumble if using. Garnish with halved cherries."
introduction: "Hazelnut and cherry, with amaretto bringing warmth. White chocolate cream whipped, thickens with chill. Brownie base sturdy, slightly fudgy, scattered with toasted nuts. Cherries cooked down thick, jelly-like, rest on rich brownie. Smooth dark chocolate custard cloaks fruit, cooling into silky coat. Crunch of cocoa-dusted chocolate crumble adds texture optionally. Layers of flavor — some fruity tart, some nutty sweet, all bold with amaretto whisper. Time and cooling key; patience richer than rush. Fudgy brownie beneath, creamy layers above, whipped top crowning. Slices hold shape, speak nutty, fruit, and spirit. Different notes in each bite; play on textures. Forgone some sugar, adjusted chocolate ratio; balance gained by tweaks. From baking heat to chilled set, dessert shifts states, ending rich yet airy, firm yet yielding. Brownies with edge chopped off, neat squares shine under cream and crumble. Cherries fresh or frozen, work either way"
ingredientsNote: "Flour and hazelnut amounts reduced around 35% for better control of batter consistency. Milk powder replaces fraction of flour for richness in crumble, less dense than all flour. Butter amount dropped slightly to keep brownie moist without greasiness. Brown sugar replaced partially with granulated purely to moderate sweetness and allow chocolate flavors to punch. Vanilla extract lowered; amaretto flavor retained but balanced. White chocolate lessened to fit cream volume; chocolate species choices lean darker in crumble and custard for contrast with white cream. Gelatin dosage tailored for solid cherry topping with some wiggle. Cherry count cut to fit total dessert size, halved for bake compatibility. Choices give refined sweetness and textural contrast, crunch, softness, creamy layers. Egg size standard assumed; whipping cream iced for sturdier peaks."
instructionsNote: "Sequence split by chilling needs: whipped cream first for six hours or overnight. Brownie baked midheat for 35 min approx, checking earlier to avoid overdone middle. Crumble baked while brownie cools, spread with chocolate, chilled overnight if possible. Gelatin soaked then mixed hot cherry, puréed, chilled to firm on brownie base. Custard made last, careful heat on whisk back to coat, cooled and spread over cherry. Full refrigeration after assembly essential to firm custard and cream before slicing. Piping chantilly optional with Saint-Honoré tip, soft peaks crucial, overwhip loses smoothness. Chocolate crumble step optional but adds pleasant textural counterpoint. Brownie edges trimmed after baking for uniform slices. Using parchment overhang aids in neat brownies removal. Hand blender purees cherries to consistent texture, no large chunks. Custard cooled 30 minutes before spreading to avoid melting prior layer. Freeze stage offered after custard, before chantilly, but not mandatory. Garnishing final touches, chocolate crumble dusted with cocoa gives bittersweet finish, cherries fresh on whipped cream tops highlight fruit note."
tips:
- "Chilling whipped cream is crucial. Minimum time is five hours. Makes a difference. Coat chocolate well; it helps the crumble firm up. Don’t rush this phase. Patience pays off in texture."
- "Monitor your brownie doneness carefully. Check with a toothpick early. Overbaking will ruin fudginess. Leave some moist crumbs on toothpick. Adjust oven temp if necessary, every oven differs. Room temp eggs help bonding."
- "For the crumble, mixing until barely moistened is key. Avoid overmixing. It adds a crunch that contrasts with soft layers. Don’t skip the cocoa dusting; brings depth. Cool completely before coating."
- "Using fresh cherries elevates flavor. Frozen ones work, but fresh provide texture. Adjust cooking times slightly for frozen cherries. Cherry jelly should be spreadable, semi-firm but not runny. Let cool before applying."
- "Custard must be carefully heated. Constant stirring essential to avoid scrambling eggs. Watch for thickening, it should coat back of spoon. Properly cooled before spreading on layers matters. Chill thoroughly."
faq:
- "q: What if brownies are too soft? a: Check baking time. Use toothpick test. Adjust oven temp to get that rich texture. They should be fudgy not gooey. Overbaking makes them dry sometimes."
- "q: Can I use other nuts? a: Yes, walnuts or pecans will also work. But they change the flavor profile a bit. Hazelnuts give a unique nuttiness. Always toast nuts for better taste, don't skip this."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container. Cover well to maintain moisture. They can last up to a week. For longer storage, consider freezing. Thaw in fridge for softness."
- "q: Can I substitute gelatin? a: You could use agar-agar. But results differ slightly in texture. Gelatin gives a more traditional jelly feel. Adjust blooming times based on your substitute."
