ingredients:
- "2 red bell peppers halved and seeded"
- "318 g (about 11 oz) firm tofu cut into 12 slices"
- "2 small zucchini sliced lengthwise about 6 mm (1/4 inch) thick"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) fresh lime juice"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) rice vinegar"
- "75 ml (5 tbsp) mayonnaise"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) toasted sesame oil"
- "4 flour tortillas 25 cm (10 in)"
- "500 ml shredded iceberg lettuce"
- "Salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat grill or grill pan on high."
- "Brush peppers, tofu, and zucchini with olive oil. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Place peppers on grill skin-side down. Cook until charred, 8-10 minutes. Place in sealed container to steam. Cool and peel off skin. Refrigerate."
- "Grill tofu and zucchini 3 minutes each side. Cool zucchini."
- "Mix lime juice and rice vinegar in bowl. Add tofu, toss gently. Add salt and pepper. Set aside."
- "Combine mayonnaise with toasted sesame oil in small bowl."
- "Lay tortillas flat. Spread mayo mixture evenly."
- "Down center to right side, layer tofu, peppers, zucchini, lettuce."
- "Roll tightly. Wrap individually in parchment, fold ends like a candy wrapper."
- "Cut wraps in half to serve."
introduction: "Tofu and veggies go charred and cool. Peppers blackened till skin curls and slides off. Tofu slices marinate sharp and sweet with lime and rice vinegar instead of mirin. Zucchini strips grill fast, soak smoky flavors. The mayo twist: sesame oil stirred in for nuttiness, taking place of plain mayo. Tortillas lay flat, waiting for the pileup. Lettuce shredded crisp. Wrap it all tight, fold ends, slice halves. Cool to eat or pack for on-the-go. Minimal fuss. Balanced bite. No nuts, no dairy. Crunch meets creamy, fresh meets smoky. The grill marks work twice - veggies and tofu. A quick, packed meal. Uncomplicated layers, bursting flavor contrast."
ingredientsNote: "The quantities shift a bit for ease and freshness. Using 11 oz tofu ensures enough for 4 to 6 wraps but easier handling. Olive oil trimmed slightly to avoid sogginess inside. Substituting rice vinegar for mirin adds acidity and brightness without sweetness—a sharper twist. Sesame oil doubles down on the toasted flavor but at a safe dose to avoid overpowering. Instead of complex sauces, the simple mayo and oil meld keeps it streamlined but flavorful. Peppers need peeling after charring; locking in sweetness while removing bitterness. Zucchini stays firm, thin slices grill quickly. Iceberg lettuce is crisp, adding crunch and moisture balance. Flour tortillas remain standard size but feel free to swap for whole grain or corn for texture variations. Salt and pepper fundamental, no extra spices needed."
instructionsNote: "Start heating grill high to get good crisp marks quickly. Prepare veggies and tofu brushing gently with oil and seasoning beforehand. Focus first on peppers: grill longer on highest heat skin side, then contain in sealed container briefly to steam and loosen skin for easy peeling—achieves deep smokiness and soft flesh. Refrigerate peeled peppers promptly to firm them up chilled. Tofu and zucchini grill faster, 3 minutes per side to golden grill lines; cool zucchini fully before assembling to avoid soggy wraps. After grilling, marinate tofu briefly in lime juice and rice vinegar mixture to absorb tang and give a light acidic lift, season each step with salt and pepper to taste. Mix mayo and toasted sesame oil while cooling tofu to avoid oil separation. Assembly on flat tortillas spreads mayo evenly to hold fillings; layered by right side in long strips for neat rolling. Wrap folds like candy to hold contents secure, sliced in halves for manageable portions. Wraps can be refrigerated for packed lunches, eaten cool or brought to room temp. Timing is roughly 38 minutes total but depends on grill heat and prep speed."
tips:
- "Grill peppers till skin chars. 8-10 minutes. Contain in sealed container. Let steam a bit. Peel easy. Retains flavor. Cool in fridge before use."
- "Zucchini slices thin. 1/4 inch is perfect. Grill quickly, 3 minutes each side. Keep firm. Cool down after grilling to avoid sogginess in wraps."
- "Use firm tofu. Marinate quickly. Lime juice and rice vinegar mix. Tangy kick. Salt and pepper all steps to enhance flavors."
- "Mayo mix in a bowl. Add sesame oil. Stir well, keep it from separating. Spread evenly on tortillas, crucial for holding wraps together."
- "Wrap tightly. Fold ends like candy. Slices make portions manageable. Refrigerate for packed lunches. Eat cool or at room temp."
