slug: "chocolate-hazelnut-madeleines"
description: "Tiny chocolate bites with hazelnut crunch. Dark chocolate and nutty butter blend for a rich, tender crumb. Substituted almond flour for part of the all-purpose for extra nuttiness and lighter texture. Added a pinch of cinnamon to the dry mix for subtle warmth. Batters whipped just enough to keep air bubbles alive, crucial for that tender rise. Double mold usage cuts baking time but watch for edges darkening—oven quirks vary. Dipped in tempered dark chocolate, sprinkled with toasted hazelnuts for contrast in crackle and flavor. Resting times adjusted slightly; watch texture not just the clock."

ingredients:
- "100 g dark chocolate 70%, chopped"
- "90 g unsalted butter"
- "85 g all-purpose flour"
- "30 g almond flour"
- "2.5 ml baking powder"
- "1.5 ml ground cinnamon"
- "1 ml salt"
- "3 large eggs"
- "75 g granulated sugar"
- "2.5 ml vanilla extract"
- "150 g tempered dark chocolate 70% for coating"
- "40 g toasted hazelnuts, chopped"
instructions:
- "=== Madeleines ==="
- "Position oven rack center. Preheat oven to 190 °C (375 °F). Butter two 12-cavity madeleine pans thoroughly; dust lightly with flour to prevent sticking if you want—this catches stubborn ones."
- "Melt chopped chocolate and butter gently over simmering water or microwave in short bursts, stirring often. Must be warm but not hot, to avoid scrambling eggs later. Set aside to cool slightly while you prep dry ingredients."
- "Sift together all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt into a bowl. Almond flour changes texture; expect lighter but nutty crumb."
- "Whisk eggs and sugar vigorously for about 3 minutes until pale, ribbons form. This air whip traps gases making batter rise. Don’t overdo or you’ll deflate."
- "Fold in cooled chocolate mixture carefully, no rush. Then gently fold dry ingredients in batches, stopping when just combined. Overmix deflates and toughens edges."
- "Spoon batter filling molds about three-quarters full; allow space for the madelaines to puff and develop that familiar hump. Tap pan sharply against counter once or twice to even the batter and release bubbles."
- "Bake 9 to 11 minutes. Watch edges and tips—they should be firm to the touch, browned but not burnt. Sharp cracking sound as you tap a shell means done. Color shifts from shiny to matte."
- "Remove pans from oven. Let madeleines cool on racks about an hour. Don’t rush dipping warm or chocolate melts poorly and nuts won’t stick well."
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "Prepare baking sheet lined with parchment or silicone mat. Keep tempered chocolate warm but not hot—too runny dips too deep, too cool won't coat."
- "Pour chocolate into a tall cup for easy dipping. Dunk only one-third of each madeleine, set on sheet. Immediately sprinkle chopped toasted hazelnuts on wet chocolate for that punch of roasted crunch."
- "Allow dipped madeleines to set at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes. Too cold and you risk condensation blurring edges and dulling snap. Too warm and chocolate streaks."
- "Store finished madeleines in airtight container up to 3 days. Almond flour reduces shelf life slightly—sooner is better."
introduction: "Chocolate and nuts, a classic combo but tweaked here with almond flour for moisture and texture twists. Cinnamon sneaks in to wake the palate, subtle but impactful. Not a straightforward batter; timing and temperature control crucial. Egg foam’s the backbone, the fragile network you coax with sugar and whisking. Overmix and poof, dense middles—been there. Madeleines want heat that’s high enough for a quick rise but not so hot it burns the edges before the center cooks through. I learned the hard way. Dipping warm cakes in chocolate ruins shape and snap; patience pays. Toasted hazelnuts add crunch, a counterpoint to soft crumb. The copper tones of browned edges smell like fall afternoons. Tempting. Yet unforgiving if you rush. Visual cues trump timers. That signature hump signals right done. The batter’s lively, so go gentle folding. Play with your oven quadrant—little shifts change everything. This isn’t just dessert, it’s a dance of textures, temperatures, and timing."
ingredientsNote: "Substituted 30% of the all-purpose with almond flour. Adds moistness and subtle nuttiness but watch it won’t bind like gluten. Ideal if fresh or blanched almond meal available. Cinnamon optional but adds warmth and complexity. Dark chocolate at 70% ensures bitterness balances sugar; can drop to 60% for sweeter. Butter unsalted, essential to control final saltiness. Vanilla extract over essence—better aroma and flavor. Toast hazelnuts yourself if possible for freshness; store nuts airtight to prevent rancidity. If no hazelnuts, toasted almonds or pecans work but shift texture slightly. Tempered chocolate mandatory for shine and snap; if impatient, melted chocolate can be used but expect dull finish and softer texture. Be mindful of egg freshness for foaming power—inferior eggs yield heavier madeleines. Use room temp eggs to ease emulsification. To grease pan, butter plus a light dusting of flour beats oil for flavor. Flour dusting also helps release if butter sticks."
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven fully before batter prep—oven spring crucial. Step heat low, then medium rather than blasting at 400F like original; prevent over-browning edges while middles finish baking. Melt chocolate and butter on low to prevent seizing. Gentle cooling avoids cooking eggs when mixing. Sift dry ingredients for even leavening dispersion; skipping causes uneven rise, lumps in batter. Whisk eggs and sugar until foamy ribbons form, this traps air and leavens naturally—skip or rush this and you get dead dense shells. Fold dry ingredients gently but fully; overmix ruins texture by collapsing air pockets. Fill molds 3/4 full. Less means flat, more overflows. Tap mold to release large bubbles and level batter surface. Oven placement—middle rack central. Baking 9-11 minutes; edges firm and starting to brown. A dull, non-shiny surface signals that moisture’s evaporated, batter set. After baking, slide off molds immediately or cool for a few minutes before removing to avoid breaking delicate shapes. Cool on wire rack, air circulation avoids sogginess. Dipping must be done on cool madeleines; warm cake melts chocolate unevenly. Tempered chocolate dip coats cleanly, sets firm and shiny. Sprinkle nuts immediately then let set at room temp; too cold causes condensation, too hot waxy finish or drips. Store at room temperature wrapped in airtight container for best texture; fridge ruins crumb and dulls chocolate. If batter seems too thick after folding, a tablespoon of milk can be whisked in for moisture. If no almond flour, increase all-purpose by 30g but texture denser. Timing cues trump numbers here; learn by touch and appearance for best results."
tips:
- "Whisk eggs and sugar until pale ribbons form. Trap air well. Overwhisk kills air pockets. Underwhisk yields dense shells. Watch texture; frothy but steady. Timing’s exact here. Cold eggs slow emulsification; room temp helps."
- "Fold dry ingredients gently. Almond flour shifts texture; lacks gluten binding. Mix just enough to blend. Overmix loses volume, batter feels heavy. Batter thickness varies; add milk tablespoon if too thick but sparingly. Patience folding wins rise and light crumb."
- "Use two pans if you want faster baking but keep an eye on edges. Hot oven spots brown edges fast. Middle rack center best for even bake. Tap pan to level batter; releases excess bubbles. Avoid under or overflow; 3/4 fill only. Watch for shiny to matte change on shells."
- "Chocolate tempering is must for shine and snap. Tempered melts around 31-32 °C—use tall container for dip. Too hot, runs deep, ruins shape. Too cold, doesn’t coat well. Dipping warm madeleines softens chocolate, nuts slide off. Cool rack wait mandatory before dipping."
- "Toast hazelnuts fresh if possible. Adds punch and crunch. Chop coarse or fine depending on bite texture wanted. Store nuts airtight, rancidity kills nutty notes fast. Can swap pecans or almonds but texture shifts. Sprinkle nuts immediately on wet chocolate. Let set room temp for 45-60 mins; fridge dulls snap and crumb."
faq:
- "q: Can I skip almond flour? a: Yes increase all-purpose by 30 g. Texture denser, crumb less nutty. Almond adds moisture and subtle flavor. Without it, expect thicker batter. Watch rise, gluten drives structure here."
- "q: What if batter too thick? a: Add tablespoon of milk, whisk gently. Prevents dry crumb. Avoid adding water; changes flavor and texture. If too thin, firmer mold fill, risk heavy madeleines. Balance carefully folding dry into wet."
- "q: Why edges darken fast? a: Oven hotspots or rack too low. Middle rack recommended. Butter and dusting flour help release but edges can brown unevenly. Lower heat if edges burn before center bakes. Tap test and color shifts more reliable than timer."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container room temp best up to 3 days. Fridge ruins crumb, dulls chocolate shine. Freeze if longer storage needed; wrap tightly. Thaw at room temp. Avoid moisture buildup; condensation blurs chocolate crispness."
