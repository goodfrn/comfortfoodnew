ingredients:
- "150 ml lemon and lime juice mix (1/2 cup)"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "7 ml (1.5 tsp) crushed red chili flakes"
- "7 ml (1.5 tsp) fennel seeds, crushed"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) dried rosemary, crushed"
- "3.5 ml (3/4 tsp) salt"
- "4 bone-in pork chops, about 2.5 cm (1 in) thick, trimmed"
instructions:
- "In large sealable bag or glass dish, combine citrus juices, oil, chili flakes, fennel seeds, rosemary, salt. Mix vigorously."
- "Add pork chops. Press liquid to cover meat. Seal or cover tightly."
- "Refrigerate minimum 10 hours, up to 20 for deeper flavor."
- "Prepare barbecue or grill pan on high heat. Brush grates with oil."
- "Remove chops from marinade, wipe excess off to avoid flare-ups."
- "Grill chops 7-9 minutes per side until internal temperature 63°C (145°F)."
- "Rest chops 5 minutes before serving."
- "Serve with crunchy citrus fennel salad or creamy side like polenta."
introduction: "Citrusy punch before grilling. Pork chops soak in lemon and lime, time enough to soften but not overwhelm. Fennel seeds crushed, fragrance released. Rosemary swaps black pepper for piney herbal note. Chili flakes add heat but restrained. Chill 10-20 hours, flavors meld slow. Grill fast, hot flame, sizzle crackles. Charred edges, juicy inside. Essential to rest—juices catch back up. Serve up with something crisp or creamy. The key is balance—bright, spicy, herbaceous, smoky all in one bite. No dairy, no eggs, no nuts, just simple good flavors. Easy to assemble but need time for marinade work."
ingredientsNote: "Use fresh lemons and limes for juice mix — acidity sharp but bright. Olive oil smooths marinade, prevents sticking. Chili flakes crushed fresh if possible; dried work but less punch. Fennel seeds lightly crushed helps release aroma—use mortar & pestle or bottom of pan. Rosemary fresh or dried, crushed fine; substitutes thyme if needed but rosemary stronger. Salt adjusts tightly. Pork chops trimmed to 1 inch thick ensures even cooking and marinade absorption. Bone in for flavor and moisture retention. Avoid adding sugars; citrus brings natural sweetness balance. Marinate minimum 10 hours recommended, overnight best but not much longer than 20 or citrus can toughen meat."
instructionsNote: "Mix marinade thoroughly first so flavors integrate. Place chops in single layer if possible for even coverage—turn occasionally during marination if time allows. Preheat grill thoroughly, ensure grates oiled to avoid sticking. Pat chops dry before grilling to reduce flare-ups from oil or marinade residue. Cook over high direct heat thorough to sear surface locking juices inside; 7-9 minutes per side depending on thickness. Use thermometer for best doneness—145°F internal, rest five minutes to redistribute juices. Avoid opening grill too often or pressing chops, juices lost that way. Serve immediately after resting with sides. Cleanup marinade container or bag promptly. For additional twist, add zest to marinade or sprinkle chopped fresh herbs just before serving."
tips:
- "Use fresh lemons and limes. Juice should be sharp, bright. Avoid bottled juice. Fresh is key for marinating. Stronger flavor enhances pork well."
- "Crushed chili flakes should be fresh. More flavor. Or use dried but they’re less intense. Adjust spice level. Use more or less to fit preference."
- "Marinate pork minimum 10 hours. Overnight better. Just not over 20 hours. Citrus can toughen meat. Balance is essential for tender chops."
- "Cut pork chops to 1 inch thick. Even cooking required. Bone-in retains moisture. Flavor boost compared to boneless. Trim excess fat for better grilling."
- "Preheat grill properly. Must be hot. Oiling grates prevents sticking. Wipe excess marinade off chops before grilling. Less flare-ups possible that way."
faq:
- "q: How do I check doneness of pork chops? a: Use thermometer. Target 145°F internal. Juices run clear. Rest afterward for juiciness."
- "q: Can I use other herbs in marinade? a: Yes, rosemary works, but thyme can substitute. Try combinations. Experiment adds depth but balance is key."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container. Refrigerate for up to 3 days. Reheat gently to not dry out chops."
- "q: Can I grill indoors? a: Yes, use grill pan. Ensure good ventilation. High heat needed. Watch closely for flare-ups and smoke."
