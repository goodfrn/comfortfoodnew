ingredients:
- "1 can 350 ml coconut milk"
- "25 ml medium tapioca pearls"
- "20 ml granulated sugar"
- "1 ml sea salt"
- "900 ml finely crushed ice"
- "1 ripe large mango peeled and cubed"
- "Sweetened condensed milk to taste"
instructions:
- "Combine tapioca pearls, coconut milk, sugar, and salt in a saucepan."
- "Let soak 25 minutes so tapioca absorbs liquid and softens."
- "Heat gradually over medium heat, stirring often, until mixture thickens and pearls turn translucent. About 15 minutes but watch closely."
- "Transfer to bowl. Press plastic wrap directly onto surface to prevent skin forming."
- "Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate at least 30 minutes until cold and set."
- "When ready to serve, use spatula to stir and loosen the tapioca pudding; add spoonfuls of water if too thick to spread easily."
- "Fill shallow bowls or dessert plates with crushed ice first."
- "Spoon tapioca mixture evenly over ice."
- "Scatter diced mango on top."
- "Drizzle condensed milk over each serving as desired."
introduction: "Coconut and mango, a classic tropical duo. Tapioca pearls give chewiness to contrast the icy crunch. No eggs, no nuts, no gluten—friendly for many diets. Tapioca needs soaking before cooking for tender pearls. Coconut milk base thickened, then chilled until cold and slightly setting. Fine crushed ice breaks the heat, mango bursts sweet flavor. Condensed milk drizzle at the end adds creamy richness to the cold fruit mix. Simple to make but each element plays its role. Chill the tapioca prep to unlock a cold pudding texture, then serve atop a bed of crushed ice for the crunch. Without any heavy sugar load; gentle sweetness from coconut and mango instead. A twist on usual mango desserts—airy, not dense. Refreshing and textural, perfect as a light finish after food."
ingredientsNote: "Use medium sized tapioca pearls, not tiny or large chunks, to ensure chewy but tender bites. Tapioca benefits from soaking before cooking to soften interior. Medium tapioca thickens coconut milk slightly; no gums needed. Adjust sugar to taste depending on mango sweetness; ripe mangoes can be sweet enough alone. Fresh mango cubes should be soft but not mushy to lend a slight firmness against the smooth tapioca. Coconut milk canned varieties vary in thickness; go for full fat for richness but thin with a tablespoon water if too thick before cooking. Crushed ice fine as snow works best for textural balance; larger chunks won’t meld with tapioca as nice. Condensed milk optional, use sparingly to keep sugar balanced. Salt enhances flavor subtly without making it salty. Keep ingredients cold before serving."
instructionsNote: "Soak tapioca in coconut milk mix for 25 minutes before warming for tender pearls. Constant stirring during cooking prevents sticking and ensures even thickening. Tapioca pearls turning translucent signals readiness; do not overcook or pearls will burst and become mushy. Cover cooked tapioca pudding surface with plastic wrap to avoid skin forming as it cools. Chill at least 30 minutes until firm but still spoonable. Work quickly when assembling to keep ice from melting too fast. Stir tapioca prior to serving to loosen pudding texture; add small water amounts carefully to reach spreadable consistency. Layer crushed ice first for frostiness, then pour tapioca gently to avoid melting. Scatter mango last to keep fresh texture. Drizzle condensed milk sparingly, control sweetness at serving time. Serve immediately after assembly for best textural contrast. Utensils chilled can help maintain cold temp on table."
tips:
- "Medium size tapioca pearls, not tiny or large. Soaking helps them cook right. Soft interior. Tap the texture of pearls in pudding."
- "Coconut milk should be full-fat for richness. Thin with water if too thick. Adjust sugar to match sweetness of mango."
- "Use fresh ripe mangoes. Cut into cubes—avoid mushy! Fine crushed ice is best. Ice should be like snow, not chunky."
- "Cook tapioca gently, constant stirring helps. Watch for translucence. Don’t overcook or they’ll burst. Plastic wrap prevents skin."
- "Chill the assembled dish fast. Serve immediately for best contrast. Cold utensils help keep things cool. No melting ice."
faq:
- "q: How do I get tender tapioca? a: Soak the tapioca in coconut milk mix 25 minutes minimum. Stir during cooking. Watch for them to turn clear."
- "q: Can I use different fruits? a: Yes, adjust other fruits to taste. Some pair well, but balance sweetness. Avoid heavy flavors though."
- "q: What if my tapioca gets sticky? a: Solution, add a spoonful of water. Stir until spreadable. Don’t panic, just adjust gradually."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Keeps for a few days. But texture changes as it sits. Be aware."
