description: "Rich buttery cookies punched up with dark rum and dried fruit bits. Simple dry flour base blended into soft, malleable dough with golden sugar, rum essence, and vanilla. Baked just enough to be slightly browned. Sweet rum glaze brushes on hot cookies, twice done, sticky, shiny. Golden raisins replaced with chopped dried apricots, rum swapped for spiced rum for deeper notes, pinch of cinnamon added to dough. Timings tweaked slightly for perfect texture. No eggs, no nuts, lactose-free with slight butter swap. Hand-formed dough balls roll in flour. Baking sheet lined. Hot oven. Double glaze application. Cool fully before storing or nibbling."

instructions:
- "=== PREP ==="
- "Set oven rack mid-level. Preheat oven 175 °C (350 °F). Line baking tray with parchment or silicone mat."
- "In medium bowl, whisk flour, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside."
- "In large bowl, beat vegan butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add spiced rum and vanilla extract, mix well."
- "Slowly incorporate dry mix into wet. Fold in chopped apricots carefully."
- "Using 15 ml scoop, portion dough. Roll into balls with lightly floured palms. Place spaced on tray."
- "=== BAKING ==="
- "Bake for 22–25 minutes or until edges turn light golden - watch closely near end."
- "=== GLAZING ==="
- "While baking, mix icing sugar with spiced rum till smooth."
- "Immediately remove cookies from oven. Brush top surface generously. Let rest 10 minutes."
- "Apply second glaze layer. Cool completely on wire rack."
- "Store in airtight container once cold."
introduction: "Dry, buttery, boozy. They crack slightly on edge but soft inside. Apricots chopped, sweet little bursts, not raisins. Spiced rum—deep, warm, with a hint of clove and cinnamon—mixes better with cinnamon dusted in dry ingredients, adds complexity. Dough's sticky but manageable with hands floured enough. Scooping ice cream spoon works neat, keeps size small, uniform. No eggs, vegan butter stands in smooth, less creamy but close. Sugar pressed in coarse enough for caramelized baking edge. Double brushed with rum icing. Stickier, shinier, not too sweet. Wait fully cool or glazing slips off. Thin, crisp sucrée base, rum bite in aroma, golden in color, soft crumbs with chewy apricot pieces. Cookie plate or jar—gone fast."
ingredientsNote: "All-purpose flour unbleached preferred for texture and color; can use whole wheat for denser biscuit but changes chew. Vegan butter softens easier than regular butter when at room temp, keeps recipe lactose-free. Sugar amount adjusted down slightly to maintain balance with glaze sweetness. Spiced rum swap introduces warm notes over plain dark rum, good with cinnamon addition. Dried apricots add tang and chew different from raisins. Cinnamon optional but recommended; compliments spices in rum for subtle warmth. Icing sugar in glaze must be mixed until lump-free to get even coating. Measuring ingredients by weight helps precision since dough consistency critical; too wet results in spreading, too dry, crumbly biscuits."
instructionsNote: "Preheat well to ensure steady bake, middle rack gives even heat distribution to crisp edges but keep soft center. Mixing dry ingredients apart prevents pockets of salt or cinnamon clumps in dough. Cream vegan butter and sugar thoroughly to introduce air for texture. Fold flour carefully to not overwork gluten and keep tender crumb. Use ice cream scoop for uniform cookies; clean between scoops if dough sticks. Flour hands lightly for rolling balls to avoid dough sticking but avoid excess flour that dries dough. Baking time varies; check after 20 minutes, look for light golden edges, slightly soft centers for moistness. Remove promptly from hot baking sheet or risk burning under. Glaze while cookies warm to absorb better; two layers prevent soggy texture but give shine. Cooler on wire rack to dry and set glaze. Store airtight to keep crispness. Great with tea or afternoon pick-me-up."
tips:
- "Measure weight, precise baking really matters for texture here. Too much flour, the dough gets dry. Too little, the cookies spread. Use a kitchen scale. Recommended."
- "Maintain flour and butter temperature. Cold butter limits spread but not too cold. Softened works better. Room temp is key for mixing. Don't skip preheating oven."
- "Use proper storage to maintain crunch. Airtight container is vital. If you want soft cookies, keep tissues in. Just don’t mix soft and crunchy in same jar."
- "If cookies too dry, underbaked or too much flour. Might not hold shape while baking. If dough’s too sticky, flour hands. Roll just enough, avoid excess."
- "Try adding zest. Orange zest enhances flavors but don’t overload. Makes it fresh. A hint of nutmeg in glaze could surprise taste buds. Subtle warmth factor."
faq:
- "q: How should I store these cookies? a: Keep in airtight container. Room temp works best. Crispiness is key here. Fridge makes them softer, don’t do that."
- "q: What if my dough is too sticky? a: Add little flour, not too much. Roll with floured hands gently. Avoid overworking. Dough should be manageable, not too wet."
- "q: Can I use other dried fruits? a: Yes, but adjust sugar content. If using sweeter fruits, balance is key. Adds different texture too. Experiment, see what works."
- "q: Baking time seems off, what to do? a: Check at 20 minutes. Ovens vary, guidelines not definitive. Light golden edges, soft centers for right moisture. Watch closely."
