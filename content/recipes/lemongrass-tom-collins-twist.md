ingredients:
- "=== Lemongrass syrup ==="
- "175 ml honey (instead of sugar)"
- "175 ml water"
- "1 stalk lemongrass split lengthwise"
- ""
- "=== Cocktail ==="
- "50 ml gin"
- "50 ml lemongrass syrup"
- "50 ml yuzu juice (instead of lemon juice)"

instructions:
- "=== Lemongrass syrup ==="
- "1. Heat water, honey and lemongrass in small saucepan just until honey dissolves completely. No boiling necessary, keep below 90°C to preserve flavor. Let simmer gently for about 8 minutes. Remove from heat. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate minimum 15 minutes."
- "2. Strain out lemongrass stalk. Syrup keeps up to 3 months refrigerated in sealed container."
- ""
- "=== Cocktail assembly ==="
- "3. In a tall glass, pour gin, 50 ml chilled lemongrass syrup, and yuzu juice."
- "4. Add ice cubes filling 3/4 of glass, stir briefly."
- "5. Top with sparkling water for a slight fizz. Adjust syrup or yuzu balance if preferred."
- "6. Garnish with twisted peel or wedge of lemon or yuzu. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Gin shining bright. Lemongrass sings in syrup, slow heat. Honey thick, golden sweet, swapped the raw sugar grind. Yuzu juice sharpens bright citrus bite, brings something different. Sparkling water bubbles gently blast, not club soda. Ice packed tall glass. Lemon twist or yuzu slice curls on rim. Minimal fuss, total impact. Chill syrup slow, no wild boil, flavor locked and neat. Quick assemble. Pour, mix, fizz. Summer sip or anytime buzz. Not too sweet, just right zing. Vegan, no nuts, no dairy. Easy swaps, new taste. Different but familiar. Fresh herb in every sip. Experiment vibrant. Punchy. Simple precision."
ingredientsNote: "Honey replaces granulated sugar for a smoother, richer sweetness that dissolves fast without boiling over. Using water less than boiling temperature protects delicate citrus oils in lemongrass. The stalk split wide releases more aromatic oils without bitterness. Yuzu juice adds intense citrus complexity compared to common lemon juice—tart and fragrant. Sparkling water offers gentler carbonation than club soda, making bubbles fine and less salty, enhancing subtle lemongrass notes. Fresh garnish of lemon or yuzu peel provides visual punch and essential oils aroma. Keep lemongrass syrup refrigerated; honey prolongs shelf life. Stir before use to blend syrup if separation occurs."
instructionsNote: "Step one is gentle heat infusion of honey and lemongrass to preserve floral top notes. No rapid boil needed, slow simmer to fully dissolve honey. Cool syrup completely then strain well before refrigeration to avoid floating pulp or fibers. When mixing cocktail, measure carefully for balance—liquor, syrup, citrus juice each equal parts but reduced from original volumes to keep delicate flavors distinct. Pour over lots of ice for chill and dilution control. Stir briefly not vigorously to keep bubbles in sparkling water. Final touch of citrus garnish adds oils and freshness. Serve promptly to maintain fizz and aroma. Adjust syrup or yuzu juice to taste for sweetness or tang if desired. Experiment with garnish or swap botanicals in gin for variation on this base. Clean glassware enhances presentation and taste."
tips:
- "Use fresh lemongrass. Split stalks release aromatic oils. Don't skip simmer step. Low heat. Preserve flavors. Chill syrup fully before using. Good temperature control."
- "Yuzu juice adds tang. Citrus complexity. Substitute if needed. Use lemon if yuzu unavailable. Adjust ratios carefully. Use equal parts for balance. Stir briefly. Don't lose fizz."
- "Honey gives smooth sweetness. Replace sugar with honey. Fast dissolving without boiling helps flavor. Keep syrup refrigerated. Up to 3 months lasts. Strain well for clarity."
- "Sparkling water adds fizz. Lighter than club soda. Use it. Gentle bubbles are better for flavors. Maintain visual appeal too. Fresh garnish matters. Lemon twist or yuzu slice vibrancy."
- "Adjust flavor as needed. Balance sweetness with syrup. Or add more yuzu for tang. Taste preference varies, experiment lots. Add different herbs too for unique variations."
