slug: "coconut-lime-scones"
description: "Scones made with coconut milk, lime zest, and coconut flakes. Uses gluten-based flour, coconut milk instead of regular milk for moisture and flavor, and cold butter for flakiness. Slightly sweet with sugar added on top for crunch. Baked until golden. The lime zest gives a fresh citrus note contrasting with creamy coconut. No eggs or dairy outside butter. The dough is shaped into a disk, cut into wedges, baked on parchment. Texture is tender but crumbly. A quick bread with a tropical twist. A simple vegan-friendly scone version, swapped one wet and one dry ingredient for a twist, with adjusted proportions and times."

ingredients:
- "160 g (1 1/3 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "50 g (1/4 cup) brown sugar, plus extra for topping"
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) baking powder"
- "90 g (6 tbsp) cold vegan margarine, cubed"
- "100 ml (7 tbsp) coconut cream"
- "1 medium lime, grated zest only"
- "Unsweetened shredded coconut (optional, for sprinkling)"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack middle position. Heat oven to 205°C (400°F). Line baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat."
- "Combine flour, sugar, baking powder in food processor. Pulse a few times. Add cold margarine cubes. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs pea-size."
- "Pour in coconut cream and lime zest. Pulse briefly to moisten dry ingredients. Dough slightly sticky but manageable."
- "Flour work surface. Pat dough into 18 cm (7 inch) circle. Transfer carefully to baking sheet."
- "Sprinkle top with sugar and coconut if using. Cut into 8 wedges, keep in place on pan."
- "Bake 22-25 minutes or until edges golden with slight browning on top. Remove, let rest 10 min before serving."
introduction: "Coconut milk and lime zest. A citrusy note to counterbalance creamy, rich coconut flavor. No eggs, no dairy except margarine to keep it vegan. Simple, quick. Flaky from cold fats. Brown sugar for subtle molasses aroma. The shredded coconut scattered on top adds texture crunch, optional but recommended. Food processor helps bring mixture together fast. Dough soft, handled gently. Straight to oven. Scones aren’t fancy but sometimes straightforward comfort wins. No raising fancy techniques. Just mixing, cutting, baking. Tropical inspired turns traditional scones into something with personality. Bright for breakfasts, teas, snacks. Crumbly but moist. Lime zest is key here, not optional. Poke around, enjoy."
ingredientsNote: "Use unbleached flour for better flavor and texture. Brown sugar adds depth compared to plain white sugar. Coconut cream richer than regular coconut milk—thicker, better for hold in dough. Margarine chosen for vegan and non-dairy fat, cold cubes essential. Lime zest fresh, finely grated without white pith to avoid bitterness. Unsweetened shredded coconut adds texture and contrast, lightly toasted if desired but not required. Slightly less sugar than classic for balance with coconut and lime tartness. Baking powder sufficient agent for rise. Keep everything cold until mixing to achieve flaky crumb."
instructionsNote: "Oven preheat crucial for rise and crust. Food processor pulses to avoid overworking dough—stop as soon as crumbly. Add liquids last, minimal pulses, do not overmix or dough turns tough. Working surface floured but avoid too much to keep moisture. Shape gently into circle—pressed, not rolled. Cut wedges carefully in place to maintain shape when baking. Bake just until edges color and top golden—too long dries out scones. Cool on rack—hot scones fragile but served warm better than cold. Store in airtight, reheat briefly before serving. No refrigeration recommended immediately—best fresh."
tips:
- "Keep all ingredients cold. Cold margarine crucial for flaky texture. Breaks into small pieces. Avoid softening before mixing. Not too crumbly but not too wet. Consistency matters."
- "When pulsing in food processor, watch it. Don't overmix. The moment it looks crumbly, stop. Add wet ingredients next. Just a few pulses to combine. This helps. Creates better texture."
- "For shaping dough, use minimal flour. On work surface, pat into shape instead of rolling. Easier to control. Don’t force it. Move carefully to keep round shape intact while cutting."
- "Baking time is important. Keep an eye after 20 minutes. Check edges for golden brown. Tops should have slight color. Don't overbake. Dry scones lose appeal and texture."
- "If storing, use airtight container. Scones best fresh, but keep well overnight. Reheat gently in oven. Or microwave briefly. Crispness might fade. Fresh out of oven is best."
faq:
- "q: How do I know my scones are done? a: Look for golden edges. Top should be lightly browned too. Check after 20 minutes, keep an eye on color."
- "q: Can I use different flour? a: Yes, other varieties work. But all-purpose gives best results. Gluten-free flours may change texture. Experiment but be cautious."
- "q: What can I do with leftover dough? a: Try chilling it. Reshape later, bake again. Or freeze raw. Just thaw before baking. Repeat works too."
- "q: How should I store these scones? a: Best in airtight container at room temperature. Avoid fridge, they get dry. Heat briefly if needed. They taste better warm."
