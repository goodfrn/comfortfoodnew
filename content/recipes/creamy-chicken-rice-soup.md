slug: "creamy-chicken-rice-soup"
description: "A thick, creamy chicken and rice soup bursting with herbs and a gentle kick from chili flakes and hot sauce. Chicken pieces tossed in seasoning before hitting the pot, then cooked alongside a soffritto of onions, carrots and celery that soften into sweet-savoury harmony. Rice simmers right in the broth, thickening naturally as starch unlocks, no roux needed beyond a dusting of flour for structure. Balanced with half & half and soy sauce replacing typical dairy saltiness, this soup stretches to feed a crowd yet keeps cozy sharpness and texture. Finished off with Parmesan and parsley for bite and freshness."

ingredients:
- "1.5 pounds diced chicken breast or thigh meat"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt plus to taste"
- "1 teaspoon Italian seasoning mix"
- "1/2 teaspoon mustard powder"
- "1 teaspoon paprika"
- "1/2 teaspoon chili flakes or more if you dare"
- "4 tablespoons unsalted butter"
- "1 large onion diced"
- "3 large carrots diced"
- "3 celery stalks diced"
- "3 garlic cloves minced"
- "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme"
- "1/2 teaspoon rosemary crushed"
- "3 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
- "7 cups chicken broth, low sodium preferred"
- "2 cups half & half or substitute with whole milk for lighter"
- "1 tablespoon soy sauce"
- "1 teaspoon hot sauce (more to finish)"
- "1 1/4 cups medium-grain rice (arborio or jasmine works), rinsed"
- "Shaved Parmesan cheese, for garnish"
- "Fresh parsley chopped, for garnish"
- "Fresh ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Season diced chicken with salt, Italian seasoning, mustard powder, paprika and chili flakes. Toss in a bowl until well coated. Set aside to marinate briefly or longer if you got time."
- "Heat a heavy Dutch oven or large soup pot over medium heat. Melt butter until foamy and fragrant but not browned. Add diced onions, carrots, and celery with a pinch of kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, onions turn translucent and start sweating but not colored, about 7-8 minutes. Smell the sweetness appearing."
- "Stir in garlic, cook just until fragrant and you catch that sharp garlic aroma, about 30-40 seconds. Too long and it burns, bitter note."
- "Add seasoned chicken pieces to pot. Spread them out, let them brown slightly on the edges but don't crowd the pan. Stir occasionally but let the chicken lose its raw pink until fully opaque throughout. Should take around 6-8 minutes. Finish with thyme and rosemary scattered over."
- "Sprinkle flour over everything. Stir quickly to coat chicken and veggies. This step thickens slightly once liquids hit, avoid lumps by mixing well into fats and juices."
- "Slowly pour in chicken broth while stirring, break down any clumps. Then add half & half, soy sauce, and hot sauce. The soy adds salty depth instead of extra salt. Taste buds already waking."
- "Add rinsed rice and stir. Bring pot to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, bubbles rising steadily. Then immediately lower to a simmer. Simmer uncovered with frequent stirring to keep rice suspended and prevent sticking. It’ll take about 20 – 25 minutes, longer if you used brown rice or different grains. Watch the liquid reduce and texture thicken, soup turning luscious. If soup thickens too much or rice soaks up all broth unevenly, add splash of broth or water to loosen."
- "Final taste test before serving. Adjust salt, pepper, or hot sauce. Ladle into bowls. Garnish generously with freshly shaved Parmesan, a good crack of black pepper, and chopped parsley for brightness."
- "Leftovers reheat well but often thicken further. Add broth or water when warming up. Rice absorbs liquid but that’s why soup holds up nicely even after a day or two."
introduction: "Hearty, creamy, loaded with herbs and subtle heat. Chicken gets tossed in a quick spice mix first, something I learned chopping too early ruins texture. The base? Classic mirepoix softened in butter, the smell as onions soften always pulls me close. Garlic in right at the end of that step so it doesn’t burn bitter but still sings its song. I prefer thigh meat here but breast works fine, just watch cook times, no one wants dry chicken. Flour dusted in adds body but no heavy roux fuss. Rice simmers right in, thickening naturally, no separate pot needed. Soy sauce instead of extra salt brightens flavors deep without overpowering. Lots of ways this can rescue a chilly night or stretch into leftovers that don’t disappoint. Parmesan and parsley at the end — don’t skip — that sharp, fresh finish is everything."
ingredientsNote: "If you lack chicken thighs, breasts are totally fine but watch the cooking time; thighs stay juicy longer. Diced veggies keep things consistent but rough chopping works if you’re in a rush; just cook a bit longer. Half & half can be swapped for whole milk or even heavy cream if you want it richer — but heavy cream ups fat content significantly. Chicken broth works best low sodium, so you control salt at the end. Arborio rice plays well here, releasing starch to thicken the soup; jasmine or basmati can do but watch the texture so soup doesn’t get gummy. Flour dusting thickens gently; no skipping unless you want thinner broth. Soy sauce adds earthiness without salt bomb, can swap with tamari for gluten-free. Garlic or hot sauce adjust to your palate—easy to add more later. Parmesan garnish lovers, go heavy; it melts into the creamy surface, counterbalancing the heat and herbs perfectly."
instructionsNote: "Seasoning chicken first locks in flavor and helps brown properly — skipping this makes soup bland, trust me. Mirepoix is the heart here; softened but not browned veggies bring sweetness and depth, so patience during that 7-8 minutes is worth it. Garlic deserves a short crisp stir to avoid burning, which ruins the whole pot. Chicken pieces should cook evenly, opaque inside but not rubbery — crowding pot traps moisture and steams chicken, no good. Flour stirred in is subtle but key, coats everything and thickens once liquids go in. Pour broth slowly while stirring to prevent lumps from flour. Rice cooks right in the pot, meaning soup thickens naturally, but stir often or rice sticks, scorching the bottom fast. Turn heat down after reaching boil, simmers gently. Taste often after rice softens — add liquids, salt, or heat bit by bit. Garnish last to keep flavors bright. Reheating is your best friend; soup thickens but a splash of broth revives. Don’t walk away, thick soup needs watching for that perfect balance."
tips:
- "Season chicken early. Coat with salt, Italian seasoning, mustard powder, paprika, chili flakes. Gives surface flavor, keeps chicken juicy when browned. Wait if you have time to marinate. Skip this, chicken ends bland and dry. Toss well, don’t crowd the pan when browning; moisture traps, chicken steams, loses edges. Brown only lightly-just edges break color curls, not charred."
- "Butter melts foamy, not brown. Add onions, carrots, celery, salt pinch. Stir slow. Vegetables soften, onions go translucent, sweet aroma means right. Watch carefully. Garlic goes last, short 30-40 seconds only; no burn. Sharp aroma and no bitterness key. Stir quickly and pull off heat if smell off."
- "Flour dusting crucial but easy missed. Sprinkle, stir fast to coat chicken and mirepoix evenly. Prevent lumps, mix well in fat and juices. Add broth slow while stirring vigorously. Break those clumps. Flour thickens gently once liquid hits. Rushing steps ruin final texture; patience here saves soup’s body."
- "Rice simmers right in broth; medium grain like arborio works better but jasmine okay if watched. Stir often so rice stays suspended, no sticking. Temperature matters: bring to gentle boil, no rush. Then drop to steady simmer. Watch liquid reduce, texture thickens; rice swells, starch released naturally, thick soup without roux. Add splash broth if dries unevenly."
- "Soy sauce replaces extra salt, adds umami depth. Use low sodium broth so you control salinity. Adjust hot sauce at end based on heat level wanted; chili flakes do background heat. Keep flavors balanced, test often. Parmesan shave at service, fresh parsley chopped gives fresh, bright snap. Heat and vinegar tang sits better with herb contrast."
faq:
- "q: What if chicken sticks to pot? a: Chances high pan too hot or crowded. Try smaller batches or raise heat to brown then lower. Butter fat helps prevent, stir some during browning but not too often or won’t crisp. Timing key. Also check moisture on chicken—pat dry first."
- "q: Can I use other rice types? a: Yes but watch texture and time. Jasmine or basmati softer, less starch output. Brown rice needs longer cook, results chewier. Arborio releases starches thickening soup naturally. If swapping, watch simmer time; stirring needed more with low-starch rices."
- "q: Soup too thick after reheating? a: Add broth or water when warming up. Rice soaks liquid over time. Thin it bit at a time, stir well between additions. Leftovers usually thicken; reheating slowly on medium heat helps. Don’t boil leftovers vigorously. Keeps texture better."
- "q: Can I substitute half & half? a: Whole milk lighter texture; soup thinner but still creamy. Heavy cream richer, ups fat much. Use based on diet need. Soy sauce still needed for salt and flavor depth. Avoid watery milk-heavy combos or soup feels flat."
