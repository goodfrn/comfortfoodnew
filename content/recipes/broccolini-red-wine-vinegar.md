slug: "broccolini-red-wine-vinegar"
description: "Broccolini charred under the broiler with a sharp splash of red wine vinegar. Crunchy stalks, tender florets with a snap, tossed warm in oil, garlic, and tang. A dish where timing counts more than clocks. Visual cues like blistered edges and a bright green pop guide the way. Maldon salt flakes for that crunchy burst. Forget boring steam; broiling adds bite and smoky notes. Replace broccolini with broccolini stems or sautéed green beans for variations. A quick, bold veggie side that plays well with steak or a casual weeknight meal."

ingredients:
- "1.5 lbs broccolini stems, trimmed and halved lengthwise if thick"
- "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided"
- "2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced"
- "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, or more to taste"
- "1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup to balance acidity"
- "Maldon sea salt flakes, to taste"
- "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste"
instructions:
- "Start by rinsing broccolini well. If stalks over ¾ inch thick or woody, trim and blanch them briefly in boiling salted water 45-60 seconds to soften—don't skip; avoids toughness later."
- "Drain and pat dry thoroughly—wet veg steams rather than chars."
- "Preheat your broiler on the highest setting. Place oven rack about 5-6 inches from the heat source to get that golden blister."
- "Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon olive oil or cooking spray to prevent sticking and smoke buildup."
- "Spread broccolini in a neat single layer—crowding wilts and steams, losing that coveted snap. Watch for those sizzling sounds—that’s oil working."
- "Pop under the broiler for about 3 minutes. You want charred spots appearing; edges curling, not burnt black. If it screams smoke, move the pan lower for fewer minutes next round. Keep a close eye."
- "Flip stalks with tongs; broil an additional 4 minutes, slightly longer on second side to avoid sogginess. Up and down flips help even crisping—no lazy half turns."
- "Remove pan; immediately drizzle remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic slices, red wine vinegar, and honey or syrup directly onto broccolini while hot—heat unlocks flavors and softens raw garlic bite. Toss gently but fully; every stalk coated."
- "Season aggressively with Maldon sea salt flakes and cracked pepper for pops of texture and piercing spice. Taste, then adjust vinegar or sweetener if vinegar edges too sharp. Remember, warm broccolini absorbs seasoning best now."
- "Serve straight from the pan or plate family style. Leftovers reheat poorly; best fresh."
- "Optionally scatter toasted almonds or chili flakes for heat and crunch to mix things up."
introduction: "Char and tang. Broccolini isn’t just steamed orphaned stalks anymore. Instead, crisp blistering under high heat, the deep olive green exploding with sudden smokiness. Tossed while still hot in an acid bath—red wine vinegar bursting sharp, honey smoothing the edges. Garlic slivers soften but linger with punch. Once I skipped blanching, ended with fibrous stalks that ruined the bite; now short blanch saves the day without losing crispness. The broiler’s heat signal means watch edges curling, color darkening unevenly. Don’t half-ass the layering—crowding kills crisp. Maldon salt flakes snap like tiny explosions, black pepper ground fresh pricks the palate awake. Swap broccolini for trimmed green beans or asparagus if needed, but timing adjustments off. The aroma hits before the first crunch—smell tells you everything."
ingredientsNote: "Extra virgin olive oil is key here. Cheap oils smoke faster and impart bitter flavors. If unavailable, grapeseed or avocado oil work, but lose some body. Garlic sliced thin enough to soften in hot dressing but keep texture—minced garlic steeps too strong and harsh. Red wine vinegar varies in sharpness; start low, add more after tossing if preferred. Honey counters the vinegary bite; maple syrup replaces for a deeper earthiness. Maldon salt flakes not table salt—flaky texture enhances mouthfeel and seasoning control. Black pepper isn’t optional. If broccolini thick or limp, quick blanch in salted boiling water 45-60 seconds to prevent woody toughness; skip for thin stalks or smaller bundles. Cooking spray works but olive oil preferred for flavor and crisp results."
instructionsNote: "Broiling demands attention. Preheat fully—if unsure, test by putting a single broccolini stalk under heat 1 minute to check blistering progress. Overcrowding causes steamed limpness; spread out. The key visual cue is blistering with browning, not blackened burning. Flip carefully and fully for even surface to catch all edges. The second broil longer to get deeper char without soggy steam pockets. Remove immediately before tossing, as residual heat softens veg and blooms flavors. Adding vinegar and oil hot breaks down raw garlic harshness and distributes seasoning thoroughly—best done right on the pan for efficiency and flavor adherence. Taste as you season—vinegar can overwhelm. If vinegar overpowers, a pinch extra honey balances sharpness. Serve immediately. No reheating advice—just do fresh and don’t skimp on Maldon salt flakes for complex texture."
tips:
- "Blanch stalks if thick or woody—45 to 60 seconds in boiling salted water. Don’t skip unless stalks thin. Saves from stringy bite later. Dry thoroughly. Wet veg steams instead of chars, kills texture. Pat down, no excess water anywhere near broiler."
- "Spread broccolini in one layer only. Crowding means steaming, limp edges. Use rimmed tray to catch drips but avoid overlap. Visual cue: sizzling oil sound means heat working. If no sizzle, pan/water or oil cold—lose crisp."
- "Watch edges carefully under broiler. Brown spots, curling edges show progress. Black means burnt, bitter. Adjust rack distance if smoke ratio is too high—lower it slightly or reduce broil time. Timing varies by oven power; test a stalk first if unsure."
- "Flip stalks fully with tongs. Helps even charring—don’t do lazy half flips. Second broil slightly longer than first yields deeper char without soggy centers. Keeps texture and snap with that smoky inhale in every bite."
- "Add oil, garlic slices, red wine vinegar, honey directly on hot broccolini off heat. Heat unlocks sharp acidity, tempers raw garlic bite. Toss gently but thoroughly for full coating. Taste, adjust vinegar or sweetener if edges too sharp. Warm veg absorbs seasoning best."
faq:
- "q: Why blanch broccolini first? a: Tough stalks start woody. 45-60 seconds in salted boil softens outer fibers but keeps crisp core. Skipping blanch = stringy and fibrous bites. Thin stalk no blanch needed because broiling alone chars evenly."
- "q: Can I substitute other veggies? a: Yes. Broccolini stems, trimmed green beans, or thin asparagus works. Timing changes slight for each. Beans slightly less time; asparagus thinner, watch for quick burn. Adjust vinegar and honey ratios too based on bitterness or earthiness."
- "q: What if broccolini comes out soggy? a: Mostly crowded pan or wet stalks. Steam forms inside and ruins crisp. Use single layer, dry stalks extensively, and spread well. Also, oven rack position and broil time. Closer is faster charring but higher risk of burn. Test and adjust."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Not great for reheating. Best eaten fresh. If needed, cool quickly and refrigerate in airtight container up to 2 days. Reheat in hot pan to avoid soggy texture but expect some loss of crisp. Microwaves kill crunch, so avoid."
