ingredients:
- "1 1/10 cups mini semi-sweet chocolate chips"
- "1 tablespoon creamy peanut butter"
- "Optional 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
- "1 can 13.4 oz sweetened condensed milk"
instructions:
- "Line 9x9 inch pan with parchment paper leaving overhang for easy fudge removal."
- "In medium microwave-safe bowl, combine mini chocolate chips, peanut butter, and sweetened condensed milk."
- "Microwave on high for 50 seconds, then let stand for 70 seconds — watch for bubbling edges and chocolate glossy melt."
- "Stir vigorously while warm until fudge mix gains even, glossy sheen with no chip lumps."
- "Add vanilla extract and fold immediately — volatile aroma hits, don’t delay or booze off."
- "Pour fudge mix evenly into prepared pan, spread with offset spatula or back of spoon for smooth top."
- "Refrigerate between 50 to 130 minutes. Fudge should be firm but giving slightly under poke."
- "Use parchment overhang to lift fudge out and slice into 36 small squares. Sharp knife, wipe between cuts to avoid smudging."
introduction: "Chop. Melt. Chill. No fancy appliances needed here. Years messing with fudge taught me fleeting moments matter. Chips have to soften, not scorch. Too hot and bitter, too cold and stubborn. Peanut butter swapped in for butter adds silkiness and nutty depth, cutting bland sweetness without drowning it. Vanilla’s a quick stir in the still-warm melty mess — aromas hit like a late-night invite to the kitchen. Spread thick or thin, fridge sets hard edges but soft center. Slice with a sharp blade, slow and steady — fudge’s texture should tempt, smooth but with bite. The clink of cutting through fudge, that tiny crack sound. It’s old-school candy therapy, midnight sugar fix without the candy store chaos."
ingredientsNote: "Mini chocolate chips must be semi-sweet or bitter balance goes haywire. I swapped half a tablespoon of butter for peanut butter one round — creamy, a touch nutty, and fat richer to avoid waxiness. Vanilla extract? Use pure if you have it; flavor bombs after heat. Sweetened condensed milk is critical, no skim substitutes — richness lost makes fudge tough or gritty. Can swap mini chips for chopped bittersweet bars, but watch melting time, chunks linger. Parchment paper isn't optional — fudge sticks like glue otherwise. For creamier fudge, a splash of cream can replace some milk, but adjust chilling time to compensate. Always scout your microwave power, heating times vary or mix scorches and sets unevenly."
instructionsNote: "Don’t rush microwave time, chips change glossy when ready — stops lumping but doesn’t break smooth surface. Stir before vanilla or mix stiffens with cold spots. Spreading needs a quick flick of wrist; slow spreading leads to uneven chilling, cracks form. Chill in the coldest part of fridge, not door, for firm set. Visual clue: fudge surface should dull slightly, not sticky or wet to touch. Lift edges with parchment, folding slightly to loosen after chilling to avoid breaking fudge. Slice with clean sharp knife, heating the blade under hot water then drying helps, especially on thicker chunks to prevent dragging or tearing. If fudge becomes grainy, next batch add a bit more fat or less mixing after heating. Chunky nuts? Fold in after melting before spreading."
tips:
- "Heat in bursts, never long straight. Watch chocolate bubbles, they signal gentle melt. Overheat scorches bitterness, underheat leaves lumps. Stir while warm, don’t wait. Lava-like shine means right time."
- "Use semi-sweet chips only. Milk chips melt too fast, mess texture. Bittersweet bars chopped work but need more watch on melting chunks. Peanut butter swaps butter fat for richer silky mouthfeel, no waxy weirdness."
- "Vanilla addition timing crucial. Add when warm not hot. Aroma bursts quickly, lost if mixed late or delayed. Stir once, no overmix or it dulls shine, kills fudge gloss finish and texture."
- "Parchment paper crucial, no skip. Sticky fudge ruins edges, shredding on removal. Overhang edges help lifting out clean. Fold parchment edges slightly after chilling to loosen fudge with minimal breaks."
- "Knife prep matters. Hot water blade wipe between cuts avoids smudging. Slow steady slices give cleaner nuggets. Overchill fudge makes cutting brittle; underchill creates sticky mess. Find middle ground fridge spot for set."
faq:
- "q: Why fudge grainy? a: Could be overheating or too much stirring after melting. Fat balance off, or condensed milk substituted. Add bit more fat next time, less overpowering stir. Check microwave power too, uneven heat can cause."
- "q: Can I swap peanut butter? a: Use butter or coconut oil but texture shifts. Butter less silky, coconut oil gives waxy feel. Peanut butter adds nuttiness and fat that smooths. Adjust chilling time slightly with fats you choose."
- "q: What if fudge too soft? a: Chilling not long enough or fridge too warm spot. Coldest section needed, door bad option. Longer chill helps firm, quicker slice. Could fold in more solid bits like nuts to feel denser too."
- "q: Storage tips? a: Wrap tight, fridge best for firmness but absorbs fridge odors fast. Airtight container mandatory. Can freeze small portions wrapped well. Thaw in fridge slowly to keep texture stable. Room temp short term okay, but softens fast."
