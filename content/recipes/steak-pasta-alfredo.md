ingredients:
- "4 filet mignon steaks seasoned with salt and freshly ground pepper"
- "3 tablespoons unsalted butter divided"
- "1 1/2 cups heavy cream"
- "1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese"
- "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"
- "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"
- "1/4 cup chopped flat leaf parsley divided"
- "12 ounces fettuccine pasta"
- "1 tablespoon grapeseed oil or high smoke point oil"
instructions:
- "=== Alfredo sauce ==="
- "In a medium saucepan melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat with cream. When small bubbles form at edges, reduce heat to very low and simmer gently for 12-17 minutes uncovered. Stir occasionally to prevent skin forming on top or scorching. You'll notice sauce thickening subtly; that’s how you know it’s ready."
- "Remove pan from heat. Quickly stir in grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Add salt, freshly ground pepper, finely grated nutmeg, and half the chopped parsley. Taste and adjust seasoning. Sauce will thicken more as it cools—ideal texture for coating pasta."
- "=== Steak prep and cooking ==="
- "Preheat oven to 410°F. Dry steaks thoroughly with paper towels; moisture kills crust. Season both sides generously with salt and freshly ground pepper."
- "Heat grapeseed oil in a heavy cast iron skillet over medium-high until shimmering but not smoking. Add steaks carefully; sear without moving them for 2-4 minutes until a rich brown crust forms. Flip and add remaining 1 tablespoon butter. As butter melts, tilt pan and baste steaks continuously for about 3-4 minutes. Butter foaming, herby aroma developing, juices sizzling—signs you’re nailing it."
- "Use instant read thermometer or finger-test firmness to judge doneness. Transfer skillet to the oven. Roast steaks for 4 to 7 minutes depending on thickness and preference. Medium-rare? Lean more to 4-5 minutes. Medium or more done? Extend closer to 6-7. Remove when a few degrees under desired temp as steaks rest and carryover cook."
- "Rest steaks on cutting board tented loosely with foil for 6-8 minutes. Resting crucial—locks in juices, keeps meat tender."
- "=== Pasta and plating ==="
- "Bring salted water to boil. Cook fettuccine until just before al dente according to package; usually 9-11 minutes. Drain, reserving a splash of pasta water in case sauce needs loosening."
- "Toss pasta immediately in Alfredo sauce, stirring gently to coat thoroughly. If sauce is too thick, add small amounts of reserved pasta water to loosen."
- "Slice rested steaks thin across the grain. Plate pasta in shallow bowls or plates, top generously with steak slices. Sprinkle remaining fresh parsley, extra freshly cracked pepper and a dusting of Parmesan if desired."
- "Serve hot. Heavy cream scent mingles with buttery steak. Creamy, rich Alfredo clings to your noodles; steak tender and juicy bites contrast the smooth sauce. The faint nutmeg undercurrent cuts the richness just slightly—my favorite twist. Do not skip resting or you’ll lose juice and texture."
- "=== Tips & tweaks ==="
- "If Parmigiano-Reggiano isn’t available, use a good aged Grana Padano or a blend of Pecorino Romano and Parmesan for sharper bite. Nutmeg can be omitted if you dislike its aroma, but it adds complexity here."
- "Butter quality matters; use unsalted European-style butter if possible for creamier flavor and better browning."
- "If steak overcooks, slices thinly and serve atop pasta, then drizzle any pan juices over all to keep moist."
- "Cast iron skillet crucial for crust and basting; if unavailable, heavy stainless steel pans fine. Avoid nonstick—no fond development."
- "Don’t boil cream or let sauce bubble violently; gentle heat keeps sauce smooth and prevents cream splitting."
- "Use grapeseed or avocado oil for searing, neutral flavor and high smoke point helps crust formation without burnt taste."
introduction: "Butter melting, cream simmering softly, that first bubble whispering heat—the start of rich Alfredo in my kitchen. I’ve wrestled with sauces too thin or curdled, learned low simmer and careful stirring matter. Parmesan stirs in last, melts silky, fold in pepper and that surprising hint of freshly grated nutmeg. Steak prepped right means drying meat, searing to a crust with oil blazing hot, butter foaming for flavor overload—basting is non-negotiable. Resting steak patiently retains juices—no rushing here or you pay in dryness. Pasta just shy of al dente tosses in sauce, hugging every twist, ready to be crowned by steak slices warm and resting. The smell alone pulls you close, inviting forks and knives without ceremony."
ingredientsNote: "Butter and cream are the sauce backbone. Don’t skimp on cream quality; heavy cream or at least 36% fat gives thickness and mouthfeel. Substitute Parmigiano-Reggiano with Grana Padano or even a mix including Pecorino Romano for a sharper touch, but avoid pre-grated powders—they won’t melt correctly and risk grainy texture. Flat leaf parsley freshens; dry parsley won't do the same. Fresh nutmeg is underrated here, just a small grate changes taste appreciably. Filets best for tender bites; ribeye or sirloin work but adjust sear and roast times, thicker cuts need longer rest. High smoke point oils like grapeseed or avocado oil are crucial for searing without burning. Salt well; it draws flavor out but applying too late loses crust building. Dry steak thoroughly before sear to prevent steaming."
instructionsNote: "Start sauce early to let it thicken gradually while prepping steak. Medium heat, then low simmer stops boil and cream breaking. Watch for tiny bubbles at edges—not a rolling boil. Stir gently, no whisking to avoid aeration. Remove from heat before adding cheese to keep sauce smooth. Dry steaks before seasoning; moisture kills crust formation. Searing in hot pan gives Maillard reaction—the brown crust—flavor maker. Add butter after turn, use it to baste steak repeatedly by tilting pan and spooning melted butter, a step many skimp on but critical for flavor and texture. Thermometer use is easier than finger tests if unsure; 125-130°F for medium-rare, 135°F medium. Rest steak off heat, loosely tent with foil—don’t wrap tight or you steam meat. Pasta boiled well salted — like seawater taste — prevents blandness. Toss pasta just out of drain to coat with sauce while hot for best cling. If sauce thickens too much, add reserved pasta water a little at a time to loosen without losing creaminess. Serve immediately for best texture contrast."
tips:
- "Start sauce early, butter melting slowly with cream on medium heat. Watch tiny bubbles form on edges not boil. Stir carefully, no whisking or skin forms. Cheese folds in off-heat for smooth texture. Salt late, seasoning adjusts once cheese mixes in."
- "Dry steaks before seasoning; moisture kills crust. Heat oil till shimmering but no smoke. Sear first side 2-4 mins till deep brown crust then flip. Add butter now, tilt pan, baste constantly. Basting critical for flavor and crust depth. Butter foam aroma signals right time."
- "Use instant read thermometer if guessing doneness. Medium-rare target 125-130°F internal. Oven roast after sear 4-7 minutes depending on thickness. Rest loosely tented 6-8 mins to lock juices or steak will dry. Resting more important than many realize."
- "Pasta just shy of al dente—9-11 mins usually. Drain but reserve pasta water splash for sauce adjustments. Toss pasta immediately in sauce hot enough to coat each strand. If sauce thickens too much, gradually add reserved pasta water to loosen without watering down flavors."
- "If Parmigiano-Reggiano missing, swap Grana Padano or blend Pecorino Romano with Parmesan. Nutmeg optional but adds complexity. Butter quality counts; European unsalted preferred for browning. Grapeseed or avocado oil over olive for sear without burning. Skip nonstick pans, no fond or deep flavor then."
faq:
- "q: How to know sauce thickness? a: Watch tiny bubbles at edges not big boil. Stirring helps prevent skin. Sauce thickens faintly, coats spoon slightly thicker than cream. It feels just right when it clings yet still runs smoothly across pasta."
- "q: Can other steaks work? a: Ribeye or sirloin okay but adjust cook times. Thicker needs longer oven roast and resting time. Fat content varies, will change sauce impact. Slice thin for tough cuts. Always dry before sear or steam mess happens."
- "q: What if sauce breaks? a: Too hot or boiled cream causes split. Use gentle low simmer only. Stir gently to avoid aeration too. Add cheese off heat to prevent curdling. Adding small pasta water helps fix slight thickness fail, rebinds with starch."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep steak separate to avoid soggy pasta. Refrigerate airtight, consume within 2-3 days. Reheat sauce gently low heat, add splash water or cream to loosen. Steak slices reheat in skillet quick or eat cold with pasta cold."
