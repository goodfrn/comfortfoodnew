ingredients:
- "350 g linguine"
- "350 g small shrimps shelled thawed"
- "30 ml olive oil"
- "1 medium shallot minced"
- "2 garlic cloves minced"
- "5 ml crushed dried chili flakes"
- "1 can 400 ml fire-roasted red peppers drained"
- "190 ml 15% cream or mascarpone 65 g"
- "70 g mascarpone softened"
- "50 ml fresh basil chopped plus more for garnish"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Start: Big pot salted water boil for linguine; drop pasta; cook firm to bite. Taste early: Al dente sets texture; keep a cup pasta water handy before draining."
- "Meanwhile heat oil medium-high in large skillet. Toss in shrimps spread single layer; hear gentle sizzle; cook quickly until color turns pink and edges curl—about 2 minutes per side. Don’t crowd or shrimps steam; sear and scent develops. Remove shrimp; rest on plate; season with salt and pepper."
- "Same pan medium heat—use that shrimp fat build flavor. Add shallots, sweat slowly till translucent and edges caramelize - 4 to 5 minutes. Smell sweet onion fragrance, stir often to avoid browning too deep. Stir in garlic and chili flakes, cook 1-2 minutes till aromatic but not burnt."
- "Pour in roasted peppers; smash lightly with spoon; simmer till excess liquid reduces, thickening sauce base - about 6-7 minutes. Watch consistency; sauce should coat back of spoon, not watery. Add half the reserved pasta water to loosen if needed."
- "Turn heat to low; stir in cream and mascarpone gradually; whisk till smooth and creamy. Season with salt, pepper; toss in chopped basil; fresh herb brightens and cuts richness. Add shrimps back; warm through for 2 minutes, not more or rubbery."
- "Drain linguine, immediately toss into sauce pan. Mix thoroughly adding splashes pasta water to adjust sauce cling. Sauce must hug noodles, not pool at bottom of bowl."
- "Dish into bowls, scatter fresh basil on top. No cheese garnish—it would compete with mascarpone richness. Serve hot, spoon first bite—herbaceous, creamy heat, sweetness from shallots and smoky peppers lingering."
introduction: "Shrimp and pasta meld well but tricky—overcook shrimp and all’s lost. Tried tomato sauce versions but swapping fire-roasted red peppers adds smoky depth without heaviness tomato sometimes overshadows. Mascarpone instead of cream cheese? Silkier, less tang, better melts into sauce. Shallots slow cooked bring natural sweetness cutting chili’s edge. Pasta water magic here; without it, sauce clumps or too thin. This one’s about layering flavor; spice not firebomb; creamy but not cloying. A dish that feels like a cheat even when you’re careful; relaxing but still impressive. Learned timing shrimp properly, watch heat, changes texture fast. Fresh basil finishes with punch so don’t skip. Once overcooked shrimp messes this up—trust senses for perfect bite."
ingredientsNote: "If shrimp hard to get or budget tight, swap with scallops or firm fish chunks—adjust cook time same principle: quick high heat sear. Fire-roasted red peppers replace canned tomatoes for smoky undertone but regular tomatoes okay if drained well. Mascarpone not at hand? Cream cheese works but add splash lemon juice to lift creaminess. Basil here cups freshness; parsley original was good but basil’s sweetness works better against chili. If no chili flakes, smoked paprika offers heat plus smokiness without burning tips. Olive oil for sauté, can use avocado oil if you want neutral flavor and higher smoke point. Garlic and shallot finely chopped for cooking evenly; big rough pieces burn rapidly. Always save pasta water; starch helps sauce cling and rescue texture if overthick."
instructionsNote: "Boil pasta till al dente—firm core but easy to bite, starts tenderizing but not mush. Shrimp cook fast; watch edges curl and turn opaque with pink—not pure white. Overcook and rubber city. Shallots sweat low till translucent then edges color; caramelizing adds sweetness balancing chili heat. Garlic and chili brief just till fragrant to avoid burning bitterness. Roasted peppers simmer reduces liquid; look for sauce thickening and shiny finish, not watery sloppy. Add cream and mascarpone off heat or low to avoid curdle; whisk continuous. Basil chopped fresh; added last keeps brightness intact. Toss shrimp last to retain texture, incorporate heat gently. Pasta immediately into sauce to use residual heat, toss evenly coating strands. Use pasta water gradually; too much thins, too little clumps. Final garnish fresh basil; no cheese garnish here, would compete for attention."
tips:
- "Shrimp cook fast. Listen for gentle sizzle, edges curl, color shifts pink with opaque center. Don’t crowd pan or shrimp steam, sear keeps flavor punch. Rest on plate brief while sauce cooks, seasoning works better then."
- "Shallots caramelize slowly, low heat helps sugars develop sweet aroma, edge lightly browned but not dark. Stir often or risk bitter spots. Garlic and chili flakes tossed in near end of shallot cooking, just till fragrance pops, no burn."
- "Roasted peppers drained heavy; smash with spoon to integrate texture into sauce. Simmer till thickened, sauce coats back of spoon with shiny finish, watery sauce loses punch. Add half pasta water if too thick, not all at once, texture control key."
- "Adding mascarpone off heat or very low heat prevents curdling. Whisking smooths lumps; cream or cream cheese okay substitutes but mascarpone melts silkier with less tang. Fresh chopped basil last second keeps brightness and color intact."
- "Pasta water magic: reserve before draining. Starch thickens sauce, helps cling. Toss hot linguine immediately in sauce pan; add water splash by splash, avoid sloppy sauce pooling. Keep sauce hugging noodles not pooling bottom; texture tactile."
faq:
- "q: How do I know shrimp is cooked? a: Color changes pink opaque, edges curl up tight. Slight resistance when biting. Avoid all white centers or rubbery texture. Timing tight, 2 minutes side usually."
- "q: Can I swap shrimp with other seafood? a: Yes scallops chunks firm fish both ok. Cook time like shrimp but thicker pieces need longer. Same principle: high heat quick sear avoid steaming."
- "q: Pasta sauce too thick or thin? a: Add reserved pasta water little at a time. Too thick? Water loosens without losing creaminess. Too thin? Simmer a bit longer. Watch sauce coat spoon, shiny, smooth."
- "q: Best way to store leftovers? a: Cool down fast, airtight container fridge 2 days max. Reheat gently; add splash water or cream to loosen sauce. Freeze no more than 1 month; thaw overnight for even heating."
