ingredients:
- "=== Coconut cream ==="
- "2 cans 400 ml full-fat coconut milk chilled at least 10 hours"
- "45 g sugar"
- "=== Shortcakes ==="
- "210 g unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "65 g oat flour (substituting almond powder)"
- "60 g sugar plus extra for sprinkling"
- "5 ml baking powder"
- "3 ml baking soda"
- "1 ml salt"
- "125 ml avocado oil (instead of coconut oil)"
- "185 ml unsweetened applesauce"
- "5 ml vanilla extract"
- "400 g fresh strawberries sliced"
instructions:
- "=== Preparing chilled coconut cream ==="
- "Fridge necessary min 10 hours to firm up fat in coconut milk cans. Crucial step else whipping fails. When ready, flip cans upside down. Open carefully pouring off canned liquid into separate cup; reserve for smoothies or baking. Scrape thick solid part into bowl. Add sugar. Whip with electric mixer at high speed till peaks form and cream looks like whipped cream. No fats solid enough? Stick cream in freezer 10 minutes to thicken but watch closely, melts fast. Set aside chilled."
- "=== Making shortcakes ==="
- "Preheat oven to 195 C (385 F). Position rack mid-level to ensure even heat. Line baking tray with parchment or silicone baking mat."
- "Whisk dry ingredients: flour, oat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt. Use oat flour here for slight chew and nutty depth. Stir well to distribute leaveners evenly."
- "Add avocado oil, applesauce, vanilla. Combine with food processor or by hand. Pulse or mix just until dough forms loose ball. Dough should be soft, slightly sticky but manageable. Overmixing toughens final texture."
- "Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; gently pat or roll into rectangle about 4 cm thick. Cut into 8 equal pieces, shape into slightly flattened rounds. Handle lightly to keep tender crumb. Place on prepared tray."
- "Brush tops lightly with water then sprinkle sugar generously to get caramelized crunchy top during baking."
- "Bake 20-22 minutes or until golden brown edges visible and surface springs back to touch. Color deepens as bake progresses; avoid underbaking for crumb integrity."
- "Cool completely on wire rack — too warm and cream melts, ruining texture contrast."
- "=== Assembly and serving ==="
- "Halve cooled shortcakes horizontally. Generously pile sliced strawberries on bottom half, adding their juices too for moist burst."
- "Top with whipped coconut cream. Place crown shortcake back on top gently."
- "Serve immediately before cream softens and soaks into biscuit. Best within 20 mins of assembly."
- "Leftovers: store shortcakes separately wrapped; cream keeps in fridge up to 24 hours but deflates. Strawberries can be macerated with bit of sugar and lemon juice to extend freshness."
introduction: "Midweek craving something sweet but dairy-free? Thought shortcakes impossible without cream and butter? Guess again. Learned old school tricks swapping traditional cream for whipped coconut. Yes you need chill time for coconut to cooperate — patience pays. Applesauce instead of eggs or butter changed the crumb—moist but holds shape. Oat flour over almonds twisted nutty notes subtly, plus no nuts risk makes it safe. Avocado oil adds mellow richness absorbs beautifully. Scones bake with crackling sugar crust telling if done. Strawberries juicy with faint tang cut rich sweetness. Gotta serve sharp after assembly or cream collapses. Made it countless times knowing when dough’s just right; using visual touch over timers helps so much. Baking mostly sensory not clockwork here; guesswork kills texture. Next batch I’m trying lemon zest and fresh mint fold for fun. Stay tuned."
ingredientsNote: "Chilling full-fat coconut milk is non-negotiable for coconut cream whipping—don't shortcut or risk watery failure. Use cans undisturbed for at least 10 hours, even overnight if possible. Coconut milk brands vary; choose those with fat content above 17% for best results. Oat flour replaces almond meal to avoid nut allergens without losing moisture or texture—plus oat flour lends subtle sweetness and chew. Avocado oil is more neutral with health benefits compared to coconut oil, but coconut oil delivers slightly firmer dough so adjust handling accordingly. Unsweetened applesauce replaces wet binding agents like egg or additional oil—maintains moisture but watch dough softness when using different fruits. For sugar, standard granulated works well; sprinkle extra coarse sugar atop for crisp top crust. Fresh strawberries ripe but firm prevent sogginess when assembled freshly."
instructionsNote: "Many home cooks err by skipping chilling coconut milk — whipping fails unless fat solidified. Low temp crucial; cream separates visually before opening cans. Whipping coconut cream can be tricky—start slow speed moving to high to avoid splashing or deflation. Aim for soft peaks, stop before graininess sets in. Mixing dough requires restraint; overmix toughens shortcakes and ruins desired tender crumb. Dough should feel soft yet cohesive. When cutting shapes keep light hands; dense handling compacts dough. Sugar top must be generous for caramel crackle topping. Monitor oven brown edges—too pale underbaked, too dark bitter. After baking, cooling fully is crucial; warm shortcakes cause cream meltdown during assembly. Assemble right before serving to keep textures intact. Timing is sensory here: browned edges, crackly top, spring bounce indicate done baking. Cream peaks and sheen show readiness for topping. Watch for strawberry juices dripping for juiciness indication but avoid early soaking to prevent soggy base."
tips:
- "Chill coconut milk no less than 10 hours. Must see thick solid layer separated. Any less, cream won’t whip properly. Flip cans carefully, pour off watery part; keep thick fat only. Whipping slow start then high speed to avoid collapse. Soft peaks not grainy. If fails, freeze briefly but watch close. Air bubbles matter; too much or too little changes texture. Sugar in cream sweetens but keep measured."
- "Dough mixing critical. Whisk dry ingredients thoroughly, especially leaveners; uneven mix causes uneven rise. Add avocado oil, applesauce, vanilla last. Pulse just till dough forms ball; overmixing toughens crumb badly. Dough sticky but manageable is right. On floured surface, pat to 4 cm thick rectangle. Avoid heavy hands; dense dough = dense shortcakes. Cut careful uniform pieces so bake evenly. Light water brush then sugar for crisp tops; sugar caramelizes distinctly. Bake cues in smell and sight essential."
- "Oven temp mid rack at 195 C. Watch closely edges color gold but don’t burn. Surface should spring back but not rock hard. Overbake dulls crumb, underbake soggy inside. Cooling fully on rack crucial; warm shortcakes will melt cream topping and ruin texture contrast. Assembly needs to be quick once shortcakes cooled fully; cream melts fast at room temp, losing form and soak biscuit."
- "Strawberries fresh, ripe, firm. Juice drips add moisture but too much: soggy base. Cut and slice right before assembly to keep burst aroma but avoid early maceration which softens berries. If leftovers, macerate with small sugar and lemon—extends fridge life but not beyond 24 hours max. Strawberries key for fresh scent and that sharp bite balancing sweet cream and crumb. Timing servings when berries smell vibrant."
- "Substitutions: oat flour for nut allergy and moisture. Avocado oil for milder fat than coconut oil; dough softer, handle gentle. Applesauce replaces egg/butter for moisture binder, changes crumb elasticity. Baking powder and soda combo builds rise with slight chew from oat flour. Sugar sprinkle on top for crust, no shortcuts or baking sugar substitutes. Technique beats timer; look, touch, smell determine finish. Keep shortcake tender, cream stable, berries fresh."
faq:
- "q: How long should coconut milk chill? a: Minimum 10 hours. No less or fat won’t separate well. Overnight better. Essential for whipping. If not solid, no peaks form. Cooler fridge helps. Don’t shake cans before chilling. Leave undisturbed."
- "q: Can I swap avocado oil? a: Yes, but expect firmer dough and less mild flavor. Coconut oil makes dough stiffer; avocado oil softer. Olive oil too strong, affects taste. Neutral oils like grapeseed work but adjust moisture slightly. Applesauce moisture balance must stay. Watch dough softness carefully."
- "q: What if cream won’t whip? a: Check fat layer first. Too little fat yields watery cream. Chill cans properly, whip slow speed first then high. Freeze briefly if needed but watch carefully. Sugar helps stiffen slightly. Overwhipping leads to grainy. If failing, try different brand with >17% fat. Some brands skim fat too aggressively."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep shortcakes wrapped separately, fridge best for up to 24 hours. Coconut cream loses loft, deflates on standing. Strawberries can be macerated with sugar and lemon juice to hold longer but freshness fades fast. Reassemble only before serving. Avoid storing cream atop soaked biscuits."
