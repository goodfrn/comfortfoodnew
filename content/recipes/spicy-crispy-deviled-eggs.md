- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) Dijon mustard"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) finely chopped fresh chives, plus extra"
instructions:
- "Place eggs in a saucepan, cover with warm water, bring to boil. Cover and remove from heat after boiling. Let sit 12 minutes. Drain water."
- "Fill saucepan with cold water, immerse eggs for 12 minutes. Peel eggs under cold running water, pat dry."
- "Cook bacon slice in skillet over medium heat until crisp. Drain on paper towel, chop finely."
- "In same pan, toast panko breadcrumbs with sriracha, chipotle powder, stirring constantly for 1-3 minutes until golden and fragrant. Transfer to bowl to cool."
- "Add chopped bacon to breadcrumbs, mix well. Set aside."
- "Halve eggs lengthwise, scoop yolks into bowl. Keep whites intact on serving plate."
- "Mash yolks with mayo, Dijon mustard, and chopped chives until creamy."

- "Garnish with more fresh chives."
introduction: "Half a dozen eggs boiled hard and peeled. Bacon tossed in pan until crackly, chopped fine. Panko breadcrumbs tossed in skillet with spicy sriracha and smoky chipotle. Crunchy mixture waits. Egg yolks mashed creamy with mayonnaise, mustard, and chives. Whites hollowed, filled generously. Chilled a bit. Then the fun part. Press yolk side into crunchy spicy crumbs. Sprinkle more. Fresh chives scattered on top. A snack with attitude—spicy, smoky, creamy, and crisp. No gluten, no dairy, no nuts, just punchy eggs transformed in texture and flavor."
ingredientsNote: "Eggs must be cold before peeling for easy shell removal—running water helps. Bacon smoked lends smoky depth, but pancetta or cured ham can replace. Panko breadcrumbs provide light crunch; gluten-free crumbs work but skip the toasting time. Chipotle powder added for smokiness replacing paprika, plus a pinch of cayenne for heat. Mayonnaise should be full-fat for creaminess, but vegan mayo can sub. Dijon mustard brightens the yolk mix, balances the richness. Fresh chives preferred over dried for that fresh oniony hit. Sriracha's tangy spice melds into toasted crumbs for a crunchy layer with kick."
instructionsNote: "Use fresh eggs for easier peeling. Timing critical: boiling 12 minutes then cold water bath for same to stop cooking. Crisp bacon in skillet, drain well to avoid greasy bits in crumbs. Toast panko with sriracha and chipotle gently, constant stirring to prevent burning and bring out aroma—1 to 3 minutes max. Chop bacon fine to distribute crispy texture evenly. Mash yolks thoroughly with mayo and mustard until no lumps; chives add fresh burst. Carefully fill egg whites to keep neat halves. Chill to let flavors meld before crumb coating. At serving, pressing yolk side into crumbs creates crunchy topping; pressing firmly needed. Garnish liberally with chives. Serve cold or room temp."
tips:
- "Use fresh eggs. They peel easier. Cold water helps too, but running water works best. Boil then cool. Don’t skip the ice water bath. It’s all about easy peeling. Hard boil for 12 minutes. Remember timing is key."
- "Bacon adds crunch. Crisp in skillet until crackly. Drain well. Reduce grease in crumbs. Chop fine, distribute texture. Can swap pancetta or ham for smoked bacon. Experiment with flavors but balance is essential."
- "Toast panko crumbs correctly. Skillet on medium, not high heat. Stir all the time. 1-3 minutes max to avoid burning. Add sriracha. Chipotle gives smoky undertone. Mix for even coating. Parched crumbs create crunch."
- "Egg yolk mix must be creamy. Mash yolks thoroughly. Blend mayo and mustard well. No lumps allowed for smooth filling. Fold in chives last. Fresh is splendid. Not dried. Balance richness with that fresh onion taste."
- "Chill filled eggs before serving. Let flavors meld together. Refrigerate for best results. Then coat in crunchy breadcrumbs right before. Press firmly to adhere. A generous sprinkle of crumbs enhances crunch."
faq:
- "q: How to boil eggs perfectly? a: Boil for 12 minutes. Remove heat, cover. Let sit. Cool quickly for easy peel. Ice water bath helps. Best way, every time."
- "q: What if I don’t have bacon? a: Use pancetta or cured ham as alternatives. Still get crunch. Check seasoning, adjust flavors. Spicy taste still needs balance."
- "q: Can I prepare ahead? a: Yes, chill filling before. Also chill halves. Just crumb coat just before serving. Keeps crunch longer. Timing matters for best texture."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in airtight container in fridge. Keep cold. Best consumed within 2 days. Crumbs might soften. Enjoy quick snacks though."
