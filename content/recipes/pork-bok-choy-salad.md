ingredients:
- "=== Teriyaki Dressing ==="
- "55 ml (3 tablespoons) soy sauce"
- "50 g (3 tablespoons) light brown sugar, lightly packed"
- "40 ml (2 1/2 tablespoons) molasses"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) rice vinegar"
- "1 small shallot, finely sliced"
- "2 garlic cloves, minced"
- "1 tablespoon fresh grated ginger"
- "3 ml (3/4 teaspoon) sambal oelek"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "2 pork tenderloin filets, approx 325 g (3/4 lb) each"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tablespoons) olive oil"
- "400 g (14 oz) baby bok choy leaves, separated and blanched"
- "3 carrots, julienned"
- "1 tart green apple, julienned"
- "1 green onion, chopped"
- "20 ml (4 teaspoons) fresh lime juice"
- "35 g (1/5 cup) roasted unsalted peanuts, chopped"
- "Salt and freshly ground pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Teriyaki Dressing ==="
- "1. Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, molasses, and rice vinegar in a small saucepan. Add shallots, garlic, grated ginger, and sambal oelek. Heat over medium until boiling, then reduce to a simmer. Let simmer 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens and turns syrupy. You'll smell sweet garlic and ginger notes intensifying. Remove from heat; cool completely before chilling in fridge. Sauce should coat back of spoon; too thin means simmer longer."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "2. Preheat oven to 205 C (400 F). Rack in center position. Meanwhile, pat pork dry; rub with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering hot. Sear pork, turning till all sides are golden brown—listen for that searing sizzle that means flavor. Transfer skillet to oven. Roast 13-17 minutes; internal temp 62-64 C (145-147 F) for medium. Carry-over heat finishes cooking while resting."
- "3. Remove pork; cover loosely with foil. Rest 8-10 minutes. Resting redistributes juices, keeps meat juicy, not dry or tough. Slice pork thinly across the grain."
- "4. Meanwhile, blanch bok choy leaves in boiling salted water 30 seconds till just wilted but vibrant green. Drain well; shocking in ice water optional to halt cooking if prep ahead."
- "5. In large bowl, toss bok choy, julienne carrots, apple, and green onions with half the teriyaki dressing and lime juice. Taste. Add pinch salt or splash more lime if brightness dull. This step is where textures contrast; crisp apple meets tender bok choy leaves, sweet carrots give a fresh crunch."
- "6. Divide salad onto plates, top with sliced pork. Drizzle remaining teriyaki sauce over everything. Sprinkle peanuts last for crunch and nutty aroma right before serving; adds texture contrast and flecks of toasted brown."
- "7. Serve immediately for best texture contrast. Leftover pork can be thinly sliced cold for packed lunches or grilled quickly for a second round."
introduction: "Chopping scallions; green apple crisp under the knife. Juicy pork tenderloin sears, crackling with that eager oil-shimmer. Garlic and ginger hum out their fragrance as the teriyaki bubbles—sweet, spicy, sticky. Bok choy! Blanched, just a flash to soften stalks, vibrant leaves still crunch. This salad’s a symphony. Toasted peanuts pop aroma into the air. Lime juice sharpens everything last minute—the brightness you need. Resting pork is key; I’ve punished too-hot meat before, dry and tight, no good. Rolling textures and flavors. Carrots add a natural sweetness, apple a tart twist. You’ll hear the sizzle, smell rich caramel, see salad shimmer lightly coated with gloss. Mixing bowl bursts of color. Quick roast, quick prep, but steady attention. Mismatched flavors mustard precise balance here. It’s not fancy but doesn’t skimp on depth or crunch. Trust your senses. Feel when pork is springy but firm. See bok choy turn that perfect emerald. Smell the nuts just before tossing. Mouth feels layers. Simple. Bold. Great for weeknights or impressing guests."
ingredientsNote: "Swap pork tenderloin for pork chops or chicken thighs if short on time—adjust cook times accordingly. Molasses adds depth but dark brown sugar alone works fine for less robust flavor. If no sambal oelek, use a dash of crushed red pepper flakes or freshly ground black pepper for heat punch. Rice vinegar can be swapped with white wine vinegar or even a mild apple cider vinegar, but lime juice finish is non-negotiable for brightness. Peanuts can be replaced with cashews or toasted almonds if allergies or preferences dictate—just roast until golden and fragrant. Don’t skip blanching bok choy—it softens the stalks but keeps color and bite. For the shallot, a small red onion or a mild yellow onion works if that’s what’s on hand. Keep garlic finely minced to disperse pungency without overpowering. Store the sauce in airtight container; thickens further when chilled—warm gently back in microwave or stovetop for pouring consistency."
instructionsNote: "Start sauce first—low simmer coaxing the sugar to syrupy gold. Watch carefully; too hot and it can scorch or boil off too fast. The aromas shift from sharp garlic to sweet rounded notes. Pork sear: hot pan essential for caramelized crust. No moving meat till edges release or risk tearing. Oven finish cooks evenly; test doneness with thermometer or firm touch (springy give means medium). Rest pork under foil to trap juices but avoid steaming; foil needs to be loose. Bok choy blanch no longer than 30 seconds; overdo and leaves turn slimy and color dulls. Toss salad gently to avoid bruising delicate leaves. Dress lightly to keep veggies crisp; extra sauce for drizzling is best. Toast peanuts ahead but mind not to burn; nutty scent signals perfect. Mixing textures is the highlight here—don’t overmix or crush. Serve immediately after assembling to maintain contrast between warm pork and cool salad. Leftovers reheat gently; pork can dry if overcooked."
tips:
- "Start sauce on low heat; sugar must melt slowly or burns bitter. Watch color shift. Garlic smell changes from sharp to mellow as sauce thickens. Keep stir intervals irregular; syrup texture clues readiness. Sauce too thin- simmer longer. Cool fully before fridge to prevent clumps. Sauce thickens more cold; rewarm gently for pourable consistency."
- "Searing pork needs pan screaming hot. No moves till edges release cleanly—tug early and meat tears, ruining crust. Sear all sides quick, listen for crackle sizzle. Oven finishes interior; temp in center hits medium at 62-64 C. Use thermometer or finger press, firmness tells when exact. Rest pork loosely covered; foil tight steams meat, breaks crust and juiciness."
- "Bok choy blanch quick; no longer than 30 seconds or stalks get soft, leaves dull. Shock in ice bath if prepping in advance to save crunch. Toss salad gently, avoid bruising delicate leaves or apple dilutes bright snap. Add dressing slowly, taste mid-toss to balance lime and salt — brightness dulls fast if overdressed."
- "If no sambal oelek, crushed red pepper or cracked black pepper adds heat punch. Molasses deepens glaze but dark brown sugar alone works softer. Swap pork tenderloin for chops or chicken thighs: adjust roasting time accordingly. Peanuts replaceable with cashews or almonds, roast till aroma pops. Keep garlic finely minced to spread flavor without overpowering one single bite."
- "Rest pork at least 8 minutes. Importance learned hard way—too short and juices escape with first slice, meat dries fast. While resting, blanch and prep veggies. Slice pork thin across grain for tenderness. Drizzle remaining sauce last; puddled on plate means soggy salad. Peanuts sprinkle top last second; preserves crunch and nutty aroma. Serve immediately for contrast between warm pork and crisp salad."
faq:
- "q: How to fix sauce if too thin? a: Simmer longer, lower heat. Stir often watch consistency shifts. Can cool sauce; thickens more cold. Reheat gently for pour. Overboil burns sugar bitter. If sauce lumpy cold, warm slowly to dissolve clumps."
- "q: What if no bok choy? a: Use napa cabbage or spinach quick blanched. Texture different but fresh green notes remain. Avoid hearty kale here, overpowers. Blanching time same - just till leaves soften, stays vibrant. Crunch lowers, but overall mix still works."
- "q: Pork gets dry? a: Rest longer loosely covered foil. Rest time redistributes juices, stops heat penetrating further. Dont slice hot meat direct or juices leak quick. If unsure, pull pork from oven few degrees early; carryover heat finishes. Over-cooking common mistake here."
- "q: Storing leftovers? a: Pork reheat low and slow in pan or microwave covered. Salad best eaten fresh but if needed keep dressing separate. Store salad and pork in airtight containers, fridge max 2 days. Peanuts best fresh for crunch; toasted nuts soften storing. Lime juice freshness fades fast; add extra when serving."
