description: "Pork medallions seared to a light crust paired with a crunchy slaw of cabbage mixed with charred corn kernels. A quick marinade for the pork adds a hint of tang and spice, while the salad features a splash of lime juice and toasted seeds for a smoky finish. The corn, grilled with husks removed, lends natural sweetness and char that cuts the richness of pork. A straightforward plate focusing on textures—crispy edges on the pork, crisp slaw with little soft spots—and bright, punchy notes. Swapped jalapeño for fresno chili for milder heat and used yoghurt in dressing instead of mayo to lighten things up."

ingredients:
- "600g pork tenderloin, cut into 2cm thick medallions"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "1 teaspoon ground cumin"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "1/2 head green cabbage, finely shredded"
- "2 ears sweet corn, husks removed"
- "1 small red onion, thinly sliced"
- "1 fresno chili, deseeded and chopped fine"
- "Juice of 1 lime"
- "3 tablespoons plain Greek yoghurt"
- "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar"
- "1 tablespoon toasted pumpkin seeds, crushed"
- "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Pork Medallions ==="
- "Slice pork tenderloin into thick medallions. Toss with olive oil, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper. Let sit 10 minutes minimum, longer if time; this softens the meat and gives deeper flavor."
- "Heat cast iron pan over medium-high until smoking slightly. Lay pork medallions away from you – listen for sharp sizzle immediate contact. Don't move them for 3-4 minutes. Edges browning with crisp, mahogany color means ready to flip."
- "Turn pork over, lower heat if pan flares. Cook 3 more minutes until firm but springy. Internal temp aiming for 65°C gives juicy medium — pork overcooked becomes dry rubbery. Rest covered loosely. Resting crucial to relax fibers, retains juices."
- "=== Corn Slaw ==="
- "Preheat grill or grill pan. Corn on high direct heat, turning every 2 minutes. Look for blackened kernels surrounded by golden browns—aroma sweet, nutty with smoky wafts. Around 12-15 minutes total."
- "Remove kernels from cob by standing ear on flat side and running sharp knife downward. Toss kernels with shredded cabbage, sliced red onion, chopped fresno chili."
- "In small bowl whisk together lime juice, Greek yoghurt, and apple cider vinegar. Whisk through salad coating evenly but not drowning; look for slight sheen. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Add crushed toasted pumpkin seeds and fresh cilantro last—retain crunch and freshness. Mix briefly to combine."
- "Serve pork medallions hot alongside vibrant corn slaw. Garnish with extra cilantro or microgreens for visual pop."
introduction: "Skirting the line between summer and fall flavors—corn still sweet but with char, pork tender and spiced, cabbage crunchy and sharp. Pork tenderloin slices, not bulky chops, make for fast searing and even cooking. I learned roasting pork too long kills juiciness, so now it's about quick, hot sear and rest. Corn off the cob cooks differently if boiled vs grilled—go grill every time, that charred aroma wakes up the palate. Mayo dressing too heavy previously; yoghurt brightened the salad without losing creaminess. This dish takes about 50 minutes total but if searing pork while grilling corn, it tightens up to under 45. Fresno chili swapped in for jalapeño after an eye-watering misadventure—the heat's gentler, flavor fresh. Pile on crunchy seeds to contrast softness of slaw. Not fancy but rustic with attention to texture and timing."
ingredientsNote: "Pork tenderloin—key for tenderness but pricey; pork shoulder cubes can substitute if cooked slowly elsewhere. Smoked paprika brings mild smoky depth; regular paprika works differently, less smoky but adding warmth. Fresno chili replaces jalapeño here working better for even heat control; serrano if you want more punch. Corn must be fresh—day-old corn lacks sugar needed for good caramelization so don't skip grilling. Greek yoghurt for dressing adds tang and fresh creaminess; sour cream if unavailable but thinner. Toast pumpkin seeds in dry pan 2-3 minutes until nuttier aroma; keep stirring to avoid burning. Cabbage finely shredded will mix better, avoid limpness by using only half head to prevent watery salad. Apple cider vinegar sharpness cuts through oils. If pressed for time, canned corn can substitute but lose smoky and fresh snap."
instructionsNote: "Marinate pork to infuse spice deep—not just surface. High heat sear locks juices. Don’t overcrowd pan or you’ll steam, losing crust. Look for mahogany edges and audible sizzle as real markers—not timer. Rest pork to redistribute juices—a common shortcut I regret skipping in past attempts. Char corn to just blackened spots, not burnt to carbon. Too pale and flavor falls flat. Slice corn off cob vertically with stable grip; kernels should drop cleanly without tearing to maintain texture. Dressing tossed last keeps crunch crisp. Seeds added post-dressing retain crunch; add early, they soften unpleasantly. Mix salad gently to avoid wilting cabbage. Use lime juice liberally or salad dulls—the acid brightens every bite. Plate after pork rests to serve hot meat with cold crunchy crispness standard contrast. Leftovers keep well 2 days refrigerated but salad getting soggy is inevitable—add fresh seeds on re-serving."
tips:
- "Marinate pork minimum 10 minutes, longer if time. Oil and spices soak in deeper, not surface only. Let rest after searing is crucial. Hot pan, no crowding—sear locks juices, audible sizzle tells all. Don’t skip resting pork loosely covered; fibers relax, meat holds juices better than slicing hot."
- "Grill corn husk off on high heat with turns every 2 minutes. Look for blackened spots, not full burn. Sweet aroma and nutty smoke hit at 12 to 15 minutes. Kernels pulled cleanly off cob with sharp downward knife motion; vertical slice keeps kernels intact, avoids mush. Fresh corn only—day old lacks sugar for caramel, no char taste."
- "Dress slaw last, add lime juice liberally or mix dulls fast. Whisk Greek yoghurt and cider vinegar thoroughly before tossing; provides tang and creaminess without heaviness of mayo. Add toasted pumpkin seeds post-dressing to keep crunch; early seeds soften and lose texture. Fresh cilantro last keeps brightness, add more garnish if serving."
- "Heat management key on pork pan; lower when flare ups start. Mahogany edges sound—sizzle sharp at initial hit, then calm as crust forms. Internal temp target 65°C for juicy medium. Use cast iron if possible for even heat retention and crisping. Rest covered loosely to trap warmth but avoid sweating meat into sogginess."
- "Substitutions: use pork shoulder cubes instead tenderloin if slow cooked elsewhere. Serrano chili if fresno not around but hotter heat. Sour cream replaces Greek yoghurt but thinner texture changes dressing feel. Canned corn okay in pinch but lose smoky char and fresh snap. Toast seeds in dry pan constantly stirring 2-3 minutes till nuttier aroma to avoid burnt taste."
faq:
- "q: How long to marinate? a: Minimum 10 minutes works. Longer means more flavor seeped deeper. Less just surface seasoning. Timing depends on schedule but no rush is best. Marinate in oil plus spices, salt helps draw flavors."
- "q: Can I use other chili? a: Fresno is milder choice for even heat. Serrano hotter, jalapeño sharper but can burn noses. Pick what you tolerate. Fresh, deseeded or leave some seeds for heat variation. Dry chili won’t cut."
- "q: What if pork dry? a: Usually overcooked or no resting after sear. High heat sear locks juices to inside. Rest lets fibers reabsorb moisture lost while cooking. Don’t poke meat with fork during rest. Low and slow for pork shoulder substitute if used."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Pork slices wrapped to keep moist, fridge 2 days max. Slaw gets soggy so add fresh seeds before serving again. Dressing may separate, whisk again. Freeze not advised for cabbage salad, pork can freeze separately but texture changes."
