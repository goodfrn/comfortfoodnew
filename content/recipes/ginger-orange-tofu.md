instructions:
- "=== Sauce ==="
- "1 Whisk chicken broth, orange juice, marmalade, tamari, ginger, garlic, chili paste, and cornstarch in a bowl. Set aside."
- "=== Tofu and spinach ==="
- "2 Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat. Pour in sesame oil. Add spinach. Stir, cook 4 to 5 minutes until wilted but still bright. Season with salt and pepper. Drain well, transfer to a serving bowl. Sprinkle with black sesame seeds. Keep warm."
- "3 Wipe pan clean if needed, raise heat to medium-high. Add vegetable oil. Fry half tofu pieces 2.5 minutes each side, till golden and caramelized. Remove to plate. Repeat with remaining tofu."
- "4 Pour sauce into pan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat. Simmer 3 to 4 minutes until thickened and glossy."
- "5 Return tofu to pan, toss to coat evenly. Warm through for 1 minute."
- "6 Sprinkle scallions on top. Serve tofu sauced, spinach on side. Rice if desired."
introduction: "Tofu chunks, browned crisp then drenched in a punchy orange-ginger glaze. The zing of ginger, mild sweetness from marmalade, biting soy saltiness, a subtle chili spark. Spinach leaves, gently wilted, soaked with nutty sesame oil, crunchy black sesame seeds scattered over. Green onions sliced finely for a fresh crunch. The interplay—bright greens, textured tofu, saucy heat. Fast skillet cook. No complicated steps, no waiting around. Just layering flavors, quick heat. Dinner on the table, ready to dive into citrus and spice."
ingredientsNote: "Broth and soy sauce form the savory base of the sauce; use low sodium for better control. Fresh ginger is key, grated finely or minced. Orange marmalade adds sweetness and texture; substitute with fresh orange zest and a bit of honey if desired. Sriracha or any chili paste amps the heat; omit for mild or swap with a pinch of ground cayenne. Sesame oil brings nuttiness to the spinach; avoid toasted versions if you want subtler flavor. Black sesame seeds toast well in a dry pan to release aroma. Firm tofu pressed well for extra crispness. Scallions julienned thin for maximum freshness and crunch."
instructionsNote: "Spinach cooks fast. Don’t overdo it—bright green, still moist, not soggy. Drain well to avoid watery final dish. Use a good non-stick pan. Pan-fry tofu in batches, hot pan essential to caramelize properly. Flip gently to avoid breaking. Sauce thickens with cornstarch; whisk it thoroughly to avoid lumps before adding to hot liquid. Simmer until glossy, slightly sticky. Toss tofu in last minute to soak up flavor without getting soggy. Sprinkle scallions just before serving to maintain their crisp texture. Timing matters. Prep sauce while tofu cooks to streamline. Serve immediately for best texture contrast."
tips:
- "Press tofu well. Essential step for crispiness. Slice thick. 1.2 cm works best. Use a non-stick pan. Hot heat caramelizes well. Sear both sides."
- "Sauce technique matters. Whisk all ingredients. Use cornstarch to thicken. Stir until smooth. No lumps allowed. Adjust sweetness with marmalade. Add zest if you want."
- "Spinach cooks fast. Don't let it wilt too much. Bright green is key. Season lightly. Drain excess water. Avoid soggy texture in final dish. Keep warm."
- "Fry tofu in batches. Too much in the pan lowers heat. Gold and caramelized since that’s what you want. Flip carefully. Tofu is soft. Avoid breaking pieces."
- "Scallions add crunch. Slice thinly for best texture. Last-minute sprinkle on finished dish. Brighten flavors. Freshness brings life. Don’t add too early."
faq:
- "q: Can I use regular soy sauce instead of tamari? a: Yes. Tamari is gluten-free. Regular soy gives same flavor. Adjust salt levels."
- "q: What if I don’t have orange marmalade? a: Substitute with fresh orange zest and honey. Or just use all orange juice. Just make it sweeter."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Yes but tofu can get soggy. Keep tofu separate from spinach. Store in airtight container. Reheat quickly before serving."
- "q: What other greens can I use? a: Kale works well. Chard is another option. Even broccoli if cut small. Cook quickly just till bright."
