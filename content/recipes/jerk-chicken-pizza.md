ingredients:
- "1 chicken breast, pounded to even thickness"
- "1 tbsp olive oil (extra for brushing and pan)"
- "1 tbsp jerk seasoning (use homemade or store-bought)"
- "1/4 cup cornmeal, for pan and peel"
- "1 pizza dough ball (~12 inch)"
- "1/2 cup chipotle salsa (substituting for pizza sauce)"
- "1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese divided"
- "1 tbsp jerk seasoning (reserved for topping)"
- "1/2 cup mixed bell peppers, chopped (reds and yellows)"
- "1/2 cup onions, thinly sliced"
- "1/3 cup mushrooms, chopped"
- "2 tbsp honey, drizzle finish"
instructions:
- "Ready cooked chicken first. Pound chicken breast gently—not to paper-thin but close to even thickness, about 3-4 minutes would do it. Into an airtight bag with 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp jerk seasoning. Toss to coat fully, marinate at least 35 mins in fridge. 30 isn’t bad but extra time spikes flavor. Grill over medium-high heat or pan-sear, hear that sizzle? Cook till no pink remains, around 6-7 minutes each side depending on thickness. Rest briefly. Chop or shred to small bite pieces."
- "Prep for crust. Brush 1 tbsp olive oil on a metal pizza pan or stone—stone heats better, pan heats faster. Dust with 1/4 cup cornmeal. Don’t skip cornmeal here or crust will stick and be doughy underneath; cornmeal = crispy base. Place pan or stone in oven and preheat to 430°F. Preheating pan inside oven crucial for even bottom crust bake. No you won't burn cornmeal this way. Toss flour on baker’s peel or inverted rimmed baking sheet, then 1/4 cup cornmeal over flour. Cornmeal acts like tiny ball bearings, helps pizza slide off easily."
- "Shape dough roughly to 12-inch circle on the peel or baking sheet, don’t stress about perfect edges. Brush 1 tbsp olive oil over dough surface with a pastry brush, seals it, prevents sauce from soaking in and making soggy dough. Spread 1/2 cup chipotle salsa (subbing here for usual pizza sauce) evenly—a smoky twist rather than classic tangy sauce flavors. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella evenly over sauce, then dust 1 tbsp jerk seasoning. Cheese first means toppings stick; tried it reversed, toppings slid and made sloppy mess. Now pile 1/2 cup chopped bell peppers, 1/2 cup thin slices onions, 1/3 cup mushrooms, and the jerk chicken bits. Finish off with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese over all, thick layer melts and holds toppings tight."
- "Transfer pizza carefully from peel to the heated stone or pan in oven. Most nerve-wracking step—wobbly hands? Use parchment paper under dough for safer transfer, remove after 5 minutes bake. If dough tears slightly don’t panic, patch with fingers fast. Bake begins audible: gentle crackles from dough, cheese bubbling, edges turning golden brown around 18-22 minutes. Watch dough edge color closely: golden brown but not blackened and cheese fully melting with scattered brown spots. Oven temps vary, so eyeball crust firmness gently with spatula edge; crust should feel firm but not rock hard. Inner dough stays tender if it jiggles less."
- "Once out, the smell is intoxicating; smoky, sweet, spicy all at once. Drizzle 2 tbsp honey over the entire pie right away; the warm surface melts honey, adding complexity and cutting the heat with sweetness. Slice with a pizza cutter or sharp knife. Let sit 2-3 minutes before digging in to avoid molten cheese burns."
introduction: "Forget run-of-the-mill chicken pizzas. This one? Jerk-spiced chicken with smoky chipotle salsa, layered over a crunchy cornmeal-dusted crust. Marinate that chicken longer than you think, trust me. Pound the breast evenly—uneven cooking is amateur hour. Cornmeal under crust is the unsung hero here for crisp edges. Brush oil first prevents that soggy bottom battle we all hate. I swapped in smoky chipotle salsa instead of plain pizza sauce to add coat flavor heat with a smoky undertone. Honey drizzle at the end? Don’t skip it, cuts through spice like magic. Eat hot but not molten lava melting. Colorful bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms add texture layers, herbal sharpness, and punch to balance juicy chicken. It’s about textures, aroma, and heat you can smell from the next room."
ingredientsNote: "Jerk seasoning can be store bought or homemade blended with pimento, allspice, thyme, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper. If you don’t have cornmeal, fine semolina flour works but cornmeal punch is undeniable—gives that crunchy gritty bottom bite that regular flour can’t. Swap chicken breast for thighs if you want juicier meat, just watch doneness. Chipotle salsa swaps pizza sauce for a smoky profile—but you could use a tomato paste thinned with adobo sauce. Mushrooms add earthiness and moisture, bell peppers add crunch and color—avoid overloading though or crust slips. Honey drizzle? Replace with maple syrup if you want deeper sweetness. Always keep olive oil handy for brushing crust and pan. Flour and cornmeal on peel critical to slide pizza easily into oven."
instructionsNote: "Pounding chicken is step one not optional—makes thickness even, avoids drying outer edges, speeds cooking. Marinate min 30 minutes but longer if you can; more flavor penetration. Grill or pan-fry chicken over medium-high heat—don’t crowd pan or you steam meat instead of sear. Rest before chopping to keep juices locked. Preheating pizza stone or pan is non-negotiable, trapping heat ensures bottom cooks before toppings burn. Flour then cornmeal on peel acts like roller-skates for pizza. Brush oil on dough before sauce builds moisture barrier on crust. Cheese on bottom keeps toppings from sliding off while cooking; try propping less cheese and toppings slide. Bake 18-22 minutes—listen for crackle, watch edges shift gold, cheese bubble with brown blisters. Transfer pizza carefully; rolled parchment eases slide in and out. Honey drizzle last adds flavor and shiny gloss finish. Slice after slight rest to keep cheese melty but not burn tongues."
tips:
- "Pound chicken to mostly even thickness but don’t go paper-thin—keeps juice locked but cooks evenly. Marinate cold minimum 30 minutes or longer if timing allows; deeper flavor develops slow. Use airtight bag to trap juices and seasoning. Medium-high heat on grill or pan gives sizzle and char without drying. Rest after cooking to avoid shredding dry bits. Shred or chop depending on topping size preference; smaller bits scatter better on pizza."
- "Preheat pizza stone or metal pan inside oven at full temp—430°F here. No other way; crust bottom needs immediate crisping on contact. Cornmeal dusted on pan and peel acts like little ball bearings, prevents stick but adds crunch. Flour on peel + cornmeal combo slides pizza quicker—don’t skip either. Brushing oil on dough surface before sauce traps moisture, prevents soggy crust. Use pastry brush if possible, or fingers in pinch."
- "Swap chipotle salsa for classic sauce when wanting smoky heat profile. Spread evenly but thin to avoid soggy spots. Cheese first under toppings keeps everything stuck while baking. Tried toppings-first: mess, slip off when baked, no good. Jerk seasoning sprinkled on cheese dust changes flavor mid-bake, use reserved for topping. Layer veggies chopped not too thick for consistent bake; peppers add crunch and sweetness, mushrooms keep moist earthiness balanced."
- "Transfer pizza carefully from peel to stone; parchment paper under dough helps stabilize wobbly hands and tears. Remove parchment after 5 mins baking or crust won’t brown underneath. Bake till edges golden but not blackened. Listen for bubbling cheese, light crackling from crust. Use spatula to check dough firmness if unsure; should be firm but with slight give—inner dough jiggle means not done. Oven temps differ—watch not time only."
- "Honey drizzle last—2 tbsp over hot pizza melts and spreads sweetness, cuts spice well. Substitute maple syrup if deeper sweetness preferred. Drizzle right out the oven; warm surface activates sugars better. Let pizza rest 2-3 minutes to settle toppings and cool enough to slice without molten cheese burns. Use sharp knife or pizza cutter, whichever gives cleaner cuts."
faq:
- "q: How long to marinate chicken? a: Minimum 30 mins cold in sealed bag. More time breaks down fibers for deeper flavor but not mandatory to go longer. Room temp can speed marinade but risk bacteria. I stick fridge. Longer marinade always better but 30 works alright."
- "q: Can I use chicken thighs? a: Yes and recommended if wanting juicier bites. Thighs cook differently, may need less time, watch internal temp. Skin-on optional but remove to avoid excess fat dripping on pizza. Adjust marinade time similarly. Juiciness beats breast often but can be messier to shred."
- "q: What if no cornmeal? a: Fine semolina flour can replace but doesn’t give same gritty crunch. Cornmeal creates that subtle crunch and won’t burn if oven preheated. Flour flakes slide easier but soggy bottom risk higher. Use parchment paper transfer extra cautiously if skipping cornmeal dust."
- "q: Can I prep pizza ahead? a: Dough can sit shaped on peel with cornmeal and flour dust but watch drying crust edges. Sauce and toppings best added last minute. Marinate chicken earlier. Partial bake possible, then finish topping and bake again. Storage best in fridge, reheat in oven for crisp crust, microwave ruins texture."
