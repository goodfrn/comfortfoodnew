slug: "stuffed-nicoise-buns"
description: "A savory blend of tuna, crunchy veggies, and tangy vinaigrette stuffed in tender buns. Haricots verts swapped with blanched asparagus tips for a fresh snap. Instead of red bell pepper, diced radish adds peppery crunch. Modified vinaigrette with sherry vinegar instead of red wine. Cooking times flexed for imperfect stovetop setups. Egg boiled by feel, cooking veggies alongside for efficiency. Mix of textures, vibrant colors, and punchy flavors captured in handheld bites. No mayo here—olive oil-based dressing keeps it bright and dairy free. The filling’s juicy enough to make you slightly mess but that’s part of the fun. Elevate sandwiches beyond bread, simple yet layered with bold Niçoise spirit."

ingredients:
- "Vinaigrette"
- "50 ml (3 ½ tbsp) olive oil"
- "25 ml (1 ½ tbsp) sherry vinegar"
- "1 small garlic clove, finely minced"
- "2.5 ml (½ tsp) anchovy paste or finely chopped anchovy fillet"
- "Salt and black pepper"
- "Stuffed Buns"
- "4 small round buns or ciabatta squares, plain or with olives"
- "1 egg in shell"
- "140 ml (⅔ cup) asparagus tips, cut into 1 cm pieces"
- "500 ml (2 cups) fine shredded radicchio"
- "125 ml (½ cup) halved cherry tomatoes"
- "¼ small radish, finely diced"
- "1 can 198 g (7 oz) tuna in oil, drained"
- "1 green onion, thinly sliced"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) pitted black olives, chopped"
instructions:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "Mix olive oil, sherry vinegar, garlic, anchovy paste in large bowl. Season well with salt and pepper. Taste; adjust acidity or salt depending on anchovy intensity. Set aside to let flavors meld."
- "=== Stuffing Preparation ==="
- "Slice off bun tops carefully with serrated knife. Hollow out crumb gently, don’t go too deep — want thick sides to hold filling without breaking. Keep crumbs for breadcrumbs or toast later."
- "Place egg in pot, cover with cold water. Bring to boil over medium heat, then lower heat to gentle simmer. Timer at about 7 minutes but test doneness by feel; shake egg gently—firm yolk sounds solid but still tender inside. While egg cooks, add asparagus tips with pinch of salt for last 5 minutes of simmer. Asparagus should brighten green, stay crisp tender—not mushy."
- "Drain egg and asparagus; plunge quickly in cold water to stop cooking and keep vibrant color. Peel egg under running water; peel slips off easier and egg won’t stick."
- "Cut egg into eighths; drop into vinaigrette bowl. Add asparagus, radicchio, tomatoes, diced radish, tuna, green onion and olives. Toss gently but thoroughly. Season with salt and black pepper. Let marinate 5 minutes so flavors mingle; dressing softens radicchio edges slightly, taming bitterness."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Spoon generous amount of filling into hollowed buns, pressing gently to pack but don’t crush egg pieces. Bun tops replace. Wrap in parchment or foil if eating later; filling’s juicy and aromatic, potentially messy but rewarding. Consume within a few hours for freshest texture."
- "Notes on timing—the egg’s core texture is key; too hard and it dries, too soft and it oozes. Asparagus must still snap when bitten. Radish gives unexpected peppery crunch instead of traditional bell pepper; balances richness of tuna and egg."
- "Substitutions : canned salmon or cooked white beans for tuna; red wine vinegar for sherry vinegar; green beans or snap peas for asparagus in a pinch."
- "Efficiency tip : prep vinaigrette and veggies while egg boils to maximize time. Hollow buns just before serving to avoid sogginess."
- "Common pitfalls : overboiling egg makes it crumbly; undercooking asparagus loses crunch and vibrant hue; insufficient seasoning flattens flavors."
introduction: "Ditch the usual sammy monotony. Pile into buns with bold bursts of anchovy punch, garlicky tang, and the bittersweet crunch of radicchio. Think Niçoise in handheld form—tuna, egg, veggies nested inside pillowy bread. Not just a sandwich but a mix of contrasting textures; creamy egg yolk, crisp asparagus, juicy tomatoes. No mayo but olive oil dressing that leaves a slick sheen, not heaviness. Cooking egg here is art; listen for the subtle rattle to nail that jammy center. Radish swapped for pepper because I like a sharper edge against tuna’s softness. The bun’s hollowed just so; a bite should reveal layers, never collapse. Perfect for lunches when you want something substantial but not weighed down by cheese or cream. Handles grab and go. Savor taste, smell, little flurries of flavor—minimal fuss, maximum bite."
ingredientsNote: "Swapped traditional haricots verts for asparagus tips — faster to cook, lively green snap that hits the palate brighter. Choosing sherry vinegar over red wine vinegar gives a slightly nuttier profile, enriching the anchovy’s saltiness. Radicchio, not common in sandwich salads, tames bitterness after resting in vinaigrette, balancing sweet cherry tomatoes and radish’s sharp crunch. Tuna in oil preferred for richness but good quality canned salmon or even chickpeas create nice protein alternatives. Oven-toast bun crumbs later; don’t discard. Garlic minced fine to avoid raw harshness but still noticeable. Anchovy paste delivers umami without overpowering. Black olives chopped small so they fold into the texture, no big chunks stealing focus. This combo yields complexity with pantry staples."
instructionsNote: "Start with vinaigrette mixing — acid and oil emulsify best after resting. Hollow buns carefully to preserve crust integrity; thick walls ensure no leaks or breakage. Egg boiled with slow simmer instead of rapid boil prevents cracking, controls yolk softness better — remember, feel and sound trump clock on eggs. Cook asparagus simultaneous to save energy, watch color changes, bright lime green signals doneness. Cooling down quickly is crucial for texture snap. Combine everything gently; want to keep egg quarters intact and maintain veggie crunch. Season after mixing to balance saltiness and acidity. When stuffing buns, press firmly but delicately to shape filling; too loose and it falls apart, too tight and egg breaks down. Wrap to maintain moisture if making ahead; else serve immediately for crisp toppings and bread texture contrast. Classic steps twisted with precision timing and tactile cues for best results."
tips:
- "Boil eggs slow, gentle simmer beats fast boil every time. Listen for subtle rattle—faint solid but tender center. Peel under running water; slip off shells easier, reduces white damage. Timing’s based on feel not clock."
- "Cutting buns: use serrated knife, saw gently. Hollow crumbs out carefully; keep thick walls or filling leaks and breaks. Save crumbs for toasting later, adds crunch topping or breadcrumb mix—waste nothing."
- "Asparagus—green snap means it's done. Blanch with pinch of salt in last 5 minutes of egg simmer. Cool down fast. If mushy, no crunch and dull color. Timing’s tight here between too soft and raw."
- "Vinaigrette: emulsify oil and vinegar well, garlic minced very fine to avoid harsh raw bites. Anchovy paste pulls umami without overkill. Adjust seasoning last after tossing filling; salt dulls or brightens flavor based on anchovy strength."
- "Assemble: pack filling snug but not tight. Press gently or egg pieces break down and filling becomes mushy. Wrap well for later—foil or parchment stop moisture escape but expect some juice leakage; that’s part of the experience."
faq:
- "q: How to tell when egg is done? a: Listen for rattle inside shell. Firm yolk but tender center, not chalky dry. Rapid boil cracks shell, slow simmer safer. Feel texture by shaking egg gently. Peel under running water helps remove shell cleanly."
- "q: Can I swap tuna for anything else? a: Canned salmon works well, carries similar fat content. Or cooked white beans for plant option. Chickpeas hold but change texture. Adjust seasoning to balance different protein flavors."
- "q: What if asparagus gets mushy? a: Either overcooked or blanched too long. Best to add in last minutes. Cool quickly in cold water to stop cooking and keep color snap. Under cooking loses tender bite, so timing’s key."
- "q: How to keep buns from soggy? a: Hollow out just before serving. Wrap filled buns tight if storing. Toast crumbs from hollowed part to add texture or use them to shellac crumb inside before adding filling. Quick assembly prevents wet bread."
