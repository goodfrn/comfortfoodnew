slug: "creamy-chocolate-poke-cake"
description: "Yellow butter cake baked till just golden. Poked holes filled with vanilla pudding mixed with whole milk and a hint of almond extract not vanilla. Chilled for an hour letting pudding seep. Melted bittersweet and milk chocolate with cream and butter creates a rich ganache poured generously over top. Refrigerated again till set, textures marry. Slices yield moist layers, pudding pockets, with shiny chocolate topping. Adjusted baking and chilling times for a reliable moist crumb. Nutrition moderate considering butter and chocolate mix."

ingredients:
- "1 yellow cake mix (follow box directions for size)"
- "1½ cups whole milk"
- "1 box instant vanilla pudding mix"
- "1 teaspoon almond extract (replace vanilla for twist)"
- "½ cup pudding mixture (reserved from step 3)"
- "½ cup butter (softened)"
- "½ cup bittersweet chocolate chips"
- "½ cup milk chocolate chips"
- "¼ cup heavy cream"
- "½ teaspoon vanilla extract"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven per cake box instructions. Lightly grease 9x13 pan; don't skimp here or cake sticks. Mix cake batter as directed on box; I like to swap out a tablespoon of oil for melted butter sometimes, richer flavor. Pour batter in pan, smooth surface with spatula—gets even rise. Bake till toothpick just clean, edges pulling slightly away from sides, usually 30-35 minutes depending on your oven; watch for golden dome, no overbaking. Cool completely on wire rack."
- "When cool, grab sturdy wooden spoon back and poke holes about 1.5 inches apart all over cake. Don’t punch through bottom; aim for ¾ depth. Holes let pudding soak into crumb evenly, prevents soggy mess. Set cake aside on counter."
- "Mix pudding. In medium bowl, whisk instant vanilla pudding, whole milk, and almond extract until thickened but pourable. Reserve half cup in a separate bowl, cover with cling wrap so skin doesn’t form. Pour rest immediately over cake in holes while still loose; pudding starts thickening fast. Use spatula to gently spread, pushing pudding into holes."
- "Wrap cake loosely with foil or plastic wrap; refrigerate for about 65 minutes. Pudding needs time to seep and firm but not dry."
- "For ganache, stir softened butter, bittersweet and milk chocolate chips, heavy cream, and vanilla extract in medium heat-safe bowl. Microwave in 25 second bursts stirring aggressively after each. Repeat until chocolate fully melted and glossy. Too hot? Let cool a bit before pouring or else might soak into cake too much and get greasy."
- "Pour chocolate ganache over pudding layer, spread gently but don’t push or break cake surface. It should be silky and pourable but thick enough not to run off sides. Refrigerate uncovered until set, about 4 hours or overnight if you have patience."
- "Slice clean with serrated knife warmed under hot water then dried, prevents dragging pudding out. Store leftovers refrigerated, bring to room temp 20 minutes before serving."
- "Substitution tips: If no bittersweet chips, use all semi-sweet but reduce sugar in pudding slightly. Heavy cream can be swapped for half and half in a pinch but ganache less thick."
- "Watch for wet spots: too much pudding or ganache pouring floods cake making it gummy. Control amounts and trust texture cues described."
introduction: "Moist cake layered dense with vanilla pockets. Think classic Boston cream pies but cut corners with instant pudding. Butter cake base carries aroma of warm golden crumbs just off the heat; smell mingles with chocolate ganache melting slowly. Pockmarking cake with holes isn’t just for show; each tiny crater traps pudding, locking moisture and flavor for bites rich yet light. Chocolate topping isn’t just garnish but thick glossy coat sealing in the surprise underneath. Recipes where timing and texture are everything — too long and cake bogs down, too short and pudding falls flat. Tried this multiple ways; found almond extract swapped in pudding adds subtle complexity, more upfront than vanilla. Trust fingers testing ganache warmth and poke hole depth more than clock. Refrigerator’s chill isn’t optional, pudding needs time to settle in for bites that fall apart just right without turning into mush."
ingredientsNote: "Yellow cake mix—grab a box with butter flavor over plain for added richness. Whole milk is non-negotiable here; skim waters down pudding affecting set and mouthfeel. Instant vanilla pudding can be substituted with chocolate pudding if you fancy, but changes profile completely — better reserve half cup to even it out. Almond extract replaces vanilla in pudding mixture, more assertive and less common punch elevates the dish. Butter soft but not melted for chocolate ganache prevents separation; chips blend bittersweet and milk to balance sweetness and depth. Heavy cream thickens ganache — half and half too thin, low-fat milk fails. Vanilla extract final aroma lift; don’t skip. Baking spray or butter with flour on pan ensures cake releases cleanly. Wooden spoon back ideal tool; forks or knives risk tearing fragile cake surface."
instructionsNote: "Baking time varies; check cake visually for golden dome and tester removal. Allow full cooling before poking or pudding drains straight through crumbs. Hole spacing important — too close risks collapsing cake, too far leaves dry bites. Pudding thickens fast, whisk immediately, reserve half cup smooth to drizzle as needed or repair. Pour pudding before it gels so it sinks deep. Chill minimum hour to set; no shortcuts, or cake feels runny. Ganache melts better in bursts than continuous microwave to avoid burning chocolate. Stir vigorously after each heating to prevent grainy texture. Pour ganache warm but not hot, spreads easier without breaking cake top. Final refrigeration critical to solidify ganache, stabilizing cake. Slice with warmed serrated blade to keep pudding in place. Leftovers benefit from resting before serving to regain tenderness."
tips:
- "Poke holes evenly spaced about 1.5 inch apart. Too close? Cake collapses. Too far? Dry spots, no pudding pockets. Use back of wooden spoon; forks rip fragile crust. Depth about ¾ the cake height, no punching through bottom. Avoid tearing crumb surface; pudding seeps best when holes clean."
- "Pudding mix immediate use important. Whisk vanilla pudding with whole milk plus almond extract until just thick but still pourable. Reserve half cup pudding separately to drizzle or patch later. Pour quickly over warm cake before pudding gels, push gently with spatula into holes. Timing here decides moist crumb vs wet mess."
- "Ganache requires temperature control. Melt butter, bittersweet and milk chocolate chips with cream and vanilla in short bursts microwave 25 seconds max. Stir aggressively between bursts to avoid grainy texture and overheating. If ganache too hot it melts cake crumb too much, ends greasy; too cool and it won’t spread smoothly. Use immediate pouring while warm and pourable but not runny."
- "Chill twice: First after pudding layer for minimum 60 minutes. Crucial to let pudding seep and firm without drying. Second after ganache spreads for minimum 4 hours or overnight. Ganache sets shiny, sealing moisture inside. Slice after chilling with warmed serrated knife to clean cuts, stops pudding pull and cake drag."
- "Substitutions possible but affect texture. Butter-flavored cake mix better than plain; whole milk mandatory for pudding mix set, skim waters down. Almond extract switches vanilla for punchier flavor, less common but adds depth. Bittersweet chips can swap for semi-sweet but reduce pudding sugar. Heavy cream thickens ganache best; half and half runs thin. Store leftovers cold; bring to room temp 20 minutes for best mouthfeel."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid soggy spots? a: Space holes evenly. Pour pudding before thick. Poke not too deep. Chill pudding layer well. Pudding too much? Cake soggy. Ganache runs off? Use cooler temperature, spread gently."
- "q: Can I change pudding flavor? a: Chocolate pudding okay but changes cake profile. Reserve half cup pudding to even thickness. Almond replaces vanilla in original. Swap flavors but expect texture and taste shift."
- "q: Why does ganache separate? a: Butter too soft or melted causes oily texture. Microwave bursts critical. Stir after every burst. Cooling ganache before pouring keeps cake from soaking grease. Don’t rush spread, gentle touch."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate covered to keep ganache set. Bring to room temperature 20 minutes before serving. Can freeze slices but texture changes. Best eaten within 3 days. Reheat gently if needed."
