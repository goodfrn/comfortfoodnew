ingredients:
- "wax paper for lining two baking sheets"
- "1/2 cup shredded coconut per sheet for strips"
- "1 cup mini marshmallows"
- "3/4 cup chopped walnuts mixed with 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter"
- "1 tsp almond extract as vanilla substitute"
- "1/4 cup shredded coconut for topping the logs"
instructions:
- "Line two baking sheets with wax paper. Sprinkle 1/2 cup shredded coconut on each sheet in a 3 x 10-inch strip, leaving a 1-inch gap between strips and edges. Sets the base and adds both texture and barrier to sticky marshmallow later. Toasting coconut before use intensifies flavor but not essential here."
- "In a sturdy medium-sized pot over medium-low heat, melt chocolate chips and butter together. Stir constantly to avoid scorching chocolate; watch as chips soften then slick into thick glossy chocolate sauce. Once fully melted, pull from heat, stir in almond extract instead of vanilla. Cool 3 to 5 minutes until just warm; if too hot, marshmallows will melt too fast or clump."
- "In a large mixing bowl, toss mini marshmallows with cinnamon-spiced walnuts. Using spiced nuts adds warmth and complexity. Regular walnuts fine but bland. Mix thoroughly so nuts are evenly distributed before chocolate hits."
- "Pour warm chocolate blend over marshmallow-nut mixture. Fold carefully with silicone spatula or sturdy wooden spoon until every marshmallow mound is slick and chocolate-coated. Don’t over-stir or crush marshmallows; goal is coating, not breakage. The texture is key here—soft but intact marshmallows."
- "Divide mixture into two equal portions. Scoop over coconut strips on each baking sheet. Spread gently but keep shape along strips."
- "Sprinkle 1/4 cup shredded coconut evenly on top of each marshmallow mound. This adds a final layer of chew and coconut aroma."
- "Use the 1-inch wax paper lip to lift and roll the coconut and marshmallow mixture tightly into logs. Tuck ends in like candy wrappers. Rolling loosens excess air pockets, compacts logs for cleaner slicing later."
- "Refrigerate logs for 1.5 to 2 hours or until firm to touch but not rock hard. Chill signals time to chill but texture is better judged by feel. If too soft, will smear when sliced; too hard, log fractures."
- "Unwrap chilled logs gently. Use sharp serrated knife to slice 1/2 inch rounds. Clean cuts without squish come when logs are properly chilled. Store cookies airtight at room temp up to 2 days or refrigerated for 4."
- "Variations—swap coconut for toasted pecans strips for crunch; use white chocolate and orange extract for citrus twist. Watch for melting times with different chocolates."
introduction: "Always been fascinated by sweet treats that look intricate but skip the oven. Coconut and marshmallow combo is nostalgic yet adaptable. I swapped out the vanilla—the usual suspect—for almond extract; subtle change, big impact. Cinnamon in walnuts adds unexpected warmth that cuts the sweetness. Rolling logs tight matters—helps slice clean. You want that glossy sheen on chocolate, signal it’s melted just right. Clumping marshmallows is a rookie mistake. Cool the chocolate a bit first—do not rush. The coconut strips set a firm bed and flirt with crunch. Slice logs too soon and you’ll end up with a gooey mess; chill patience pays off. Great little bites for a crowd or afternoon muse."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping vanilla for almond extract shifts flavor direction but keep it mild, too much overwhelms. Cinnamon is optional but adds a layer of warmth that pairs well with nuts and chocolate. Use unsalted butter to keep control of sodium levels. Semi-sweet chocolate provides balance against sugary marshmallows, bittersweet can overpower here unless you want that contrast. Toasted coconut strips can be swapped with finely chopped pecans if you crave crunch, but be mindful they won’t bind the logs the same way. Mini marshmallows must be fresh; stale ones don’t melt well and result in a gritty texture. Common mistake: not waiting for chocolate to cool before mixing; marshmallows could prematurely melt and turn gluey. Use wax paper with a one-inch lip to make rolling manageable and neat. Have a sharp serrated knife ready—dull blades will squish logs."
instructionsNote: "Start by prepping coconut strips on wax paper—spacing matters to prevent merging logs later. Melt chocolate and butter slowly; a heavy-bottom pan avoids hot spots and burning. Stir frequently; when chocolate glides off spoon thick and shiny, it's ready. Pull off heat and add extract; letting it cool 3-5 minutes prevents marshmallows from melting too fast. Toss marshmallows with nuts; cinnamon works magic but optional. Coat with chocolate gently; mixing too vigorously crushes marshmallows ruining texture. Spoon half mixture onto coconut strips receptive base. Sprinkle more coconut on top—it’s not just decoration; helps binding and adds chew. Use wax paper lip to roll logs tightly, folding ends gives neat, contained logs. Chill at least 1.5 hours; texture improves with muscle memory—logs should feel firm but not brittle. Slicing when too soft? You’ll get sticky, misshapen rounds like my first disastrous batch. Keep serrated knife warm by dipping in hot water, then wipe dry for cleaner cuts. Store logs airtight; refrigerate or room temp short term. Idea: introduce nutmeg and a pinch of chili flakes for heat-sweet balance—tried and liked."
tips:
- "Line sheets with wax paper and space shredded coconut strips precisely 1 inch apart to avoid logs merging. Toast coconut lightly first for bit more crunch. Use butter and chocolate melt slowly over medium-low heat, stir constantly. Chocolate changes texture, goes glossy then thick smooth. Don’t rush cooling or marshmallows melt too fast, clump up. Almond extract swaps vanilla easy but use sparingly—overpowers fast. Toss nuts with cinnamon before folding; cinnamon adds warmth, check evenly coated."
- "Fold chocolate into marshmallows gently but thoroughly. Avoid over mixing or crushing marshmallows—texture dies quickly. Use large silicone spatula or wooden spoon. Scoop mixture evenly over coconut strips, spread gently. Sprinkle extra coconut on top before rolling; helps bind and adds chew aroma. Use wax paper lip to roll tightly; tuck ends like candy wrappers to trap air pockets and compact logs for better slicing later."
- "Chill logs 1.5-2 hours minimum. Texture judged by touch, firm but not rock hard. Too soft means slicing mess, gooey rounds; too hard leads to fractured logs. Refrigeration keeps shape longer but can dry edges if wrapped poorly. Use serrated knife warmed in hot water, wiped dry, for cleaner cuts. Sharp, warm blade cuts slicker through marshmallow, no squish. Logs store well airtight 2 days room temp or 4 refrigerated; protects from moisture changes."
- "Substitute semi-sweet chocolate with bittersweet for more contrast but watch melting times carefully, burns faster. Toasted coconut strips can swap with chopped toasted pecans for crunch variation but nuts don’t bind same way. Mini marshmallows must be fresh; stale ones crumble or create gritty texture. Cinnamon optional but brings layered warmth, try nutmeg plus pinch chili flakes alternative twist; unexpected pairings work here for flavor depth."
- "Melting chocolate needs patience—heavy-bottom pan balances heat; avoid hotspots that scorch. Chocolate looks glossy then thickens slightly before removal; timing tricky but audible sizzling stops. Add almond extract after chocolate slightly cools to avoid volatility loss. Mixing chocolate and marshmallows when too hot? Marshmallows melt unevenly, gluey mess. Rolling on wax paper helps log shape stay consistent; use edges to help tuck ends before chilling for neat rolls."
faq:
- "q: Can I use vanilla instead of almond extract? a: Yes, use vanilla but almond extract changes profile; vanilla is milder here. Add after chocolate melts but cools a bit. Vanilla won’t clash but less warm complexity. Adjust amounts slightly."
- "q: Why are my marshmallows melting too fast or clumpy? a: Chocolate too hot, pouring straight from heat. Cool chocolate 3-5 mins before mixing. Over stirring crushes marshmallows; mix gently. Fresh mini marshmallows better; stale ones break down. Use low heat to melt chocolate butter combo."
- "q: How to keep logs from falling apart when slicing? a: Chill at least 1.5 hours at fridge temps. Feel logs firm, pliable but not hard. Roll tightly, tuck ends to trap air pockets. Use warm serrated knife dipped in hot water and wiped. Slice gently, clean cuts help. Avoid slicing too soon."
- "q: Best way to store logs? a: Airtight container essential. Store room temp up to 2 days or refrigerate 4 days max. Refrigeration firmer but edges dry without wrap. Avoid moisture exposure; wax paper or plastic wrap recommended. Can freeze rolls wrapped tight but texture changes."
