ingredients:
- "1 pint cherry tomatoes"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
- "4-5 day-old bagels cut into chunks"
- "8 large eggs"
- "1 cup shredded sharp white cheddar cheese"
- "1/2 cup whole milk"
- "1/2 cup sour cream"
- "1 tsp dijon mustard"
- "Cream cheese pieces for dotting"
- "Everything bagel seasoning spice blend"
- "Optional garnish sliced green onions"
instructions:
- "Begin by preheating oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with foil. Toss cherry tomatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper until slick and shiny. Roast until their skins bubble and wrinkle, about 20 to 25 minutes but watch for popping skins and a faint caramelized aroma."
- "Meanwhile, prepare bagel chunks. Use day-old bagels or slightly dry pieces to prevent sogginess later. Toast them on a foil-lined pan in the oven alongside tomatoes for about 8 minutes. If bagels start to brown too quickly, pull them earlier—too much char leads to bitterness."
- "In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, shredded cheese, milk, sour cream (switching cream for a tangier note), dijon mustard, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. You're looking for a silky, slightly thick custard base—no lumps. The sour cream adds body and tanginess missing from straight cream."
- "Fold in toasted bagel pieces gently but thoroughly. Let the mix sit for roughly 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This soak time lets the bagels soak custard without becoming mushy. Ideally bagel pieces stay puffed with soft centers."
- "Add the roasted cherry tomatoes, folding to combine but not squash. The roasted tomatoes should be soft yet intact, bursting with sweetness and slight savory char."
- "Grease a 9x13 inch casserole dish well. Pour in bagel-tomato mixture, smoothing surface. Spoon dollops of cream cheese sporadically on top—these melt into soft pockets inside the bake."
- "Sprinkle everything bagel seasoning evenly over the top. Cover loosely with foil to trap steam but prevent soggy top layer."
- "Lower oven temp to 375F. Bake covered for about 40 minutes until edges brown and center is almost set but still jiggles just a little when nudged."
- "Remove foil, bake another 8 to 12 minutes to brown and firm top without drying. Watch—the custard will stop jiggling but remain creamy. Overbaking turns the eggs rubbery."
- "Let rest 5 minutes. The bake firms as it cools. Garnish with sliced green onions and sprinkle more everything seasoning if desired. Serve warm, scoop the texture changes from crisp edges to creamy middle."
- "Keep an eye on moisture. If tomatoes release too much juice, drain excess before folding in to prevent soggy casserole."
- "If unavailable, swap sour cream for Greek yogurt or full-fat crème fraîche for creaminess and tang."
- "Saving stale bagels is key. Toasting them twice or drying in a low oven keeps them from dissolving in the egg."
- "Cream cheese dollops don't need perfect circles. Rough blobs bake into pockets of gooeyness—better texture than spreading."
- "Don’t skip the resting or soak times. Absorption phases differentiate this between curdled custard and luscious bake."
- "If you want spice, add a pinch of smoked paprika or cayenne inside custard to lift the flavor."
introduction: "Roasting cherry tomatoes until their skins glitch and bubble bursts flavor like magic. Toasting dry bagel chunks—not fresh, learn this—makes texture, prevents soggy glue. Eggs beaten with a mix of dairy, sharp cheese and dijon mustn’t be rushed; custard thick but pourable, creamy yet loose. Sitting the bread in mix makes or breaks it—don't skip. Roasted tomatoes take the acid-sweetness that pulls the whole breakfast bake together. Dollops of cream cheese melt into little pockets. Everything bagel seasoning—obvs, for punch. Covered baking traps steam so custard sets gently, uncovered to brown that top edge crisp. Resting in pan is crucial as it firms up, flavors deepen. I’ve burnt this more than once, so vigilance is mandatory. Perfumed onions on top brighten all that richness. Trust cooking by scent, jiggle and sight here. Imperfect? That’s where it’s best."
ingredientsNote: "Cherry tomatoes roast until their skins wrinkle, popping slightly, releasing juices that deepen savory acidity. Oil coats them, helping caramelize edges without burning. Day-old bagels or dry ones are a must—fresh bagels drown this custard and become heavy glue-like pulp. Toast the pieces separately, keep an eye to avoid blackened slices. Cheddar cheese works best for sharp bite; too mild and it gets dull. Switched sour cream here for tang and moisture that’s less heavy than cream—feel free to swap Greek yogurt or crème fraîche. Dijon mustard wakes up the egg bath, making custard less bland. Cream cheese blobs on top make gooey pockets, no need for even spreading, they melt beautifully. Everything bagel seasoning is essential, but if unavailable, coarse salt plus sesame and poppy seeds plus onion flakes replicate it well. Green onions for garnish cut through fat with freshness. Salt and pepper, adjust carefully; the seasoning blend has salt, so less on the bagels. A bit more oil if tomatoes dry out too much during roasting."
instructionsNote: "Roast tomatoes at 400F until bubbling and slightly wrinkled; when you hear gentle popping and smell sweet roasted skin—that’s your signal. Toast bagels on foil-lined sheet alongside—8 minutes is a guide, but watch brown edges, pull out before full darkening. Whisk eggs with dairy and mustard until smooth—no lumps or frothy foam. Fold in bagels gently; soak for 15-20 minutes, stirring here and there, so custard fully absorbs without gelatinizing. Add tomatoes carefully so they don’t bruise; roasted juices soak in but stay balanced. Grease casserole well or non-stick will stick disastrously. Spread mix in; dot cream cheese with a spoon—rough, rustic blobs work better than neat. Sprinkle everything seasoning generously; it should smell oniony and nutty before baking. Bake covered at 375F 40 minutes until edges gold, center jiggles softly. Remove foil; bake 10 more minutes to crisp top. Watch closely—overbake and custard sets hard; underbake leaves runny mess. Rest in pan 5 minutes; custard firms and flavors balance. Garnish fresh, serve warm. Timing is flexible; feel for jiggle and aroma rather than strict minutes. If too wet, drain tomatoes before adding. Looking for spice? Add to eggs before soaking bagels. Cleaning tips—foil-lined pans and greased dishes save scrubbing. You’ll find this method efficient; roasting and toasting side by side saves oven time."
tips:
- "Roast cherry tomatoes until skins wrinkle and pop softly. Listen for gentle crackle and smell caramel notes. Oil coating prevents burning but watch for drying out. Timing varies by tomato size. Avoid soggy tomatoes by draining excess juice if very wet. Layer flavors by roasting separately from bagels to keep textures clean."
- "Toast day-old bagels on foil lined pan. Watch closely to pull before too dark. Too much char adds bitterness. Toast twice for stale bagels to firm up centers. Avoid fresh bagels that turn gluey in custard. Toasted bread soaks custard but holds contours if not over-soaked. Timing soak about 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally to balance softness with structure."
- "Whisk eggs, cheese, sour cream, milk, and dijon mustard until silky with no lumps. Sour cream adds gentle tang, less heavy than cream. Mustard brightens custard taste subtly. Salt and pepper sparingly because seasoning blend adds salt. No frothy foam allowed, custard base must be smooth, slightly thick but pourable."
- "Dot rough uneven cream cheese blobs evenly over surface after pouring custard mixture in casserole. They melt into pockets creating gooey texture contrasts. Avoid perfect circles or spreading cream cheese thin. Layer everything bagel spice liberally over top for punch. If blend unavailable, coarse salt plus sesame, poppy, onion flakes recreate profile."
- "Bake covered at lowered heat 375F around 40 minutes for gentle steam setting edges. Remove foil then bake more 8-12 minutes to brown top without drying bake out. Use jiggle test for doneness; center should still gently shake under pressure but not liquid. Overbaking hardens eggs rubbery. Rest five minutes after baking for custard to firm and flavors to meld."
faq:
- "q: Can fresh bagels be used? a: Fresh not recommended. Turns gummy glue paste. Day-old or stale toast better. Twice toast for extra dryness. Avoid soggy texture. Fresh bagels soak too much quickly then collapse. Toast separately always."
- "q: Any substitutes for sour cream? a: Greek yogurt, full-fat crème fraîche work well. Both add tang and moisture. Sour cream less heavy than cream, smoother tang. Swap one-for-one. Adjust slightly for thickness. Avoid low-fat versions without adapting liquids."
- "q: How to avoid soggy bake? a: Drain roasted tomato juices before folding in if releasing too much liquid. Toast bagels thoroughly beforehand. Let bagels soak but not mush. Grease casserole well to prevent stick. Baking covered traps steam but uncovered finish crisps top reducing wetness."
- "q: Storage tips for leftovers? a: Store covered in fridge up to 3 days. Reheat covered in oven or microwave, moisture may release. Freeze in airtight container, thaw overnight in fridge first. Texture shifts with freezing. Cream cheese pockets soften when reheated. Best warm but hold well refrigerated."
