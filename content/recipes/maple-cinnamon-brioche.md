introduction: "Brioche meets maple syrup. Soft, sticky, enriched dough folded with butter and a twist of cardamom in the cinnamon filling. Malt syrup replaces milk to give a mild earthy undertone. Cuts into ten neat pieces instead of a dozen for a bit more heft per roll. The hot maple syrup bath just as they come out of the oven soaks into every crease, leaving sticky pockets of dark sweetness. A shot of maple butter glaze on top. Optional maple flakes for crunch slivers. Creamy, sweet, spicy with layers of maple complexity. Proofing and baking times cut slightly. All about that balance—soft crumb, sticky swirl, tender crust."
ingredientsNote: "Flour quantity reduced by about 30% for tighter crumb but still tender. Swapping out milk for barley malt syrup changes flavor profile to malted sweetness and enriches dough naturally—adds chewiness and a subtle umami hint. Maple sugar used in dough instead of granulated sugar to deepen flavor. Filling switches brown sugar to partial maple sugar and adds cardamom beyond the cinnamon for aromatic interest. Butter amounts trimmed moderately to balance dough hydration; still enough fat to keep tenderness. Syrup for soaking now a dark robust maple syrup; hot to absorb fast. Glaze uses whipped maple butter container slightly less volume and maple flakes added as a texture element, optional but recommended."
instructionsNote: "Start by mixing dry flour and salt. Combine wet ingredients including barley malt syrup replacing milk for more malt flavor. Yeast incorporates with warm syrup and eggs for better activation. Knead first at low speed, then increase for smoothness. Gradually add soft butter while kneading to get that enriched dough but sticky. First proof longer, warmer, and humid—110 minutes—to allow good volume. Roll dough thin and square for neat spirals. Butter layer then sprinkle sugar-spice mix, slight press ensures filling sticks without squashing dough. Rolling from edge, tight but gentle. Slice roll with dental floss for clean edges, prevents squashing compared with knife. Proof slices more modest time to puff but avoid overproofing. Bake a few minutes less than original to keep softness intact, golden but tender crust. Pour hot dark maple syrup immediately after baking; resting on rack lets syrup soak without sogginess. Glaze warmed just enough to drizzle evenly. Maple flakes sprinkled directly add contrasting crunch to soft sticky rolls. Serve warm or room temp."
tips:
- "Dough is sticky. Use a dough hook. Knead for 6 minutes. Add butter cubes on low. Then speed up. Knead till there’s smoothness. Don’t rush this part. The right texture is key. Warm, humid spot for proofing."
- "Roll dough to exact thickness. Aim for 1cm. Measure your rectangle size too. Press filling lightly. This keeps it from spilling out later. Rolling tight means better swirls. Use dental floss for clean cuts."
- "Baking temp matters. Preheat oven to 175 °C. Watch closely around 25 minutes. You want golden tops. Not too crunchy. Soft, tender rolls are the goal. Less baking time keeps them gooey."
- "Syrup soaking is essential. Pour hot dark maple syrup right out of the oven. It absorbs quickly. Rest them for 50 minutes. This is when they get sticky, sweet goodness. It’s a must-do step for flavor."
- "Maple butter glaze must be warm. Microwave briefly, keep it pourable. Drizzle generously. Optional maple flakes add nice crunch. But they also make rolls fancy. Texture contrast is key for enjoyment."
faq:
- "q: What if dough doesn't rise? a: Check yeast freshness. Use warm barley malt syrup. Too cold will stall it. Proof longer if kitchen is cold. Patience is vital for yeast."
- "q: Can I use regular milk instead? a: Yes but flavor changes. Barley malt adds depth. Milk is neutral. You lose some richness. Stick to malt for best results."
- "q: How do I store leftover rolls? a: Room temperature for 1-2 days. Wrap tightly. Refrigerate for longer but will dry out. You can freeze, though. Just warm them before serving."
- "q: Can I change the filling? a: Definitely. Add nuts or dried fruits. Try chocolate chips too. Adjust sweetness based on changes. Just keep those sticky elements."
