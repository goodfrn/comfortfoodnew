description: "Salmon fillets steamed in miso glaze with asparagus and baby potatoes, wrapped in foil. Miso mixed with mirin, honey, fresh ginger, garlic. Cooked on medium heat until fish flakes easily. Asparagus blanched first; potatoes cut into quarters. Olive oil drizzled on vegetables before enclosing. Foil packets trap steam, infuse flavors. No skin on salmon, seasoned with salt and pepper. Simple but bold umami and sweet tones. Quick cooking, watch for opaque fish flesh and firm texture to gauge doneness."

ingredients:
- "40 ml miso paste (white or yellow variety preferred)"
- "20 ml mirin"
- "20 ml maple syrup"
- "7 ml grated fresh ginger"
- "7 ml minced garlic"
- "20 baby potatoes, steamed and quartered"
- "500 g asparagus tips, blanched and cut in thirds"
- "45 ml extra virgin olive oil"
- "700 g skinless salmon steaks, divided into 4 portions"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
- "4 large sheets heavy-duty aluminum foil"
instructions:
- "Heat up barbecue or grill to high heat first to get it searing hot, about 10 minutes. You want that initial blast so it can quickly set the foil packets."
- "In a bowl, combine miso, mirin, maple syrup, ginger and garlic. Mix well until thick and fragrant. The honey swap to maple brings earthiness, less cloying."
- "Lay out foil sheets flat. Divide potatoes evenly at center; drizzle them with a good splash of olive oil, season well with salt and pepper, they’ll soak in steam."
- "Disperse asparagus on top of potatoes, another little drizzle of olive oil. The oil helps prevent sticking and adds richness under the steam cover."
- "Place salmon portions on the vegetable bed. Salt and pepper the fish surface lightly. Spoon on a generous layer of miso mix over each piece. You want something saucy but not drowning."
- "Wrap foil tightly: fold edges over to seal. You want steam trapped but a bit of room inside to puff up, doesn’t have to be vacuum tight. Avoid foil tearing."
- "Drop packets on grill set to medium—around 180°C, no flames licking the foil. Cook 15-18 minutes depending on salmon thickness. Look for opaque, flaky flesh—poke gently with fork."
- "Once done, remove from grill carefully, foil will be hot and steamy. Let rest a minute before opening; aromas of sweet miso and garlic burst out instantly."
- "Serve straight from foil or plate salmon with vegetables underneath. Sauce clings to fish; potatoes absorb flavorful juices. Texture contrast sharp from asparagus crunch."
introduction: "Miso and salmon are old pals, each lifting the other into savory territory with a sweet-spicy tease. Tried it loads of times; some ended up mushy or bitter, but the foil method really locks moisture and flavor. Also swapped honey for maple recently—less sweet, deeper. Blanching asparagus is key, else charred bitterness kills it. Potatoes need pre-cooking or you end up with hard bites. Foil technique tricks? Don’t wrap too tight; let steam balloon inside for tender fish and steamed veg. Fish thickness, heat, and smoking variations from the grill mean eyeball the doneness, fish should flake gently. Essential cook sense over exact timing. Quick, smoky, aromatic, no-fuss one foil dinner to get in your rotation."
ingredientsNote: "Miso pastes vary greatly; white miso is milder, yellow adds slight sharpness. Pick what suits mood but avoid red if possible—too salty. Mirin adds subdued sweetness and thin glaze texture. Maple syrup subbing honey means a touch less sweet yet that earthly maple tone. Fresh garlic and ginger shouldn't be too coarse, evenly minced to release aromatic oils and bite. Asparagus must be blanched to soften slightly but keep snap—otherwise stark bitterness creeps. Using extra virgin olive oil adds fruity richness but can swap to toasted sesame oil for nutty depth. Potatoes must be cooked ahead; steam, boil, or microwave so they’re tender before foil. Salmon ideally skinless here to avoid chewy foil stick and overcooked skin. Aluminum foil heavy-duty preferred to prevent tearing with steam pressure. Some use parchment but foil conducts heat better for this trick."
instructionsNote: "Start with hot grill to get even sear under foil packets—sets a slight crust on fish edges without direct flame flare. Mix miso glaze thoroughly—lumps of paste cause uneven cooking and flavor pockets. Assemble veggies on foil first, drizzle oil and salt so they absorb steam and fat, locking moisture and seasoning. Lay fish atop veggies prevents direct hot foil contact which can toughen flesh. Seal foil loosely while letting steam build inside; trying to squeeze packets tight kills steam and dries fish. Medium heat is crucial; too high flame scorches foil and bites fish edges. Watch for juices bubbling inside foil, that’s steam buildup sign. Salmon done when flesh turns opaque and flakes with slight touch, pinkish inside hints undercooked. Rest in foil after cooking locks in juices and keeps warm. Opening foil off-heat avoids steam burns. Serve from packet or plate foil juices spooned on fish and veg for full flavor. If lacking grill, oven at 190°C works but adjust time and crispness lower. Cleanup easy—foil discs at hand prevent mess."
tips:
- "Start grill hot to sear foil packets fast; sets slight crust on salmon edges but avoid flare-ups. Medium heat after prevents burning foil. Watch foil bubbles for steam buildup, reveals cooking progress."
- "Miso mix needs thorough blending; lumps cause uneven patches, some too salty, others bland. Maple syrup swap cuts sweetness, adds earthiness. Adjust ginger and garlic finely minced to spread aroma evenly."
- "Arrange veggies first on foil; drizzle olive oil and salt so steam penetrates, avoids dryness. Lay salmon on top to stop direct foil heat toughening fish flesh. Potatoes pre-steamed, asparagus blanched keeps texture sharp."
- "Wrap foil loosely enough for steam to puff but no leaks. If too tight, fish dries. Foil tearing lets steam escape, longer cook or dried edges. Heavy-duty foil best for pressure and easy folding without tears."
- "Check doneness by opaque salmon flesh and gentle flake with fork. Pink indicates undercook; overcook feels dry. Rest in foil a minute off heat to lock juices in. Opening foil slowly to avoid steam burns."
faq:
- "q: How do I know when salmon is done? a: Look for opaque flesh. Flake gently with fork. Pink inside means needs more. Touch feels firmer but not stiff. Steam inside foil helps cook evenly. Timing varies."
- "q: Can I use honey instead of maple syrup? a: Yes, honey works but sweeter. Maple adds earthier note. Both mix well with miso, balance saltiness. Adjust amount for taste. Could try brown sugar too, less liquid."
- "q: What if foil rips during cooking? a: Wrap tighter next time or double fold edges. Tears let steam out, fish dries faster. Use heavy-duty foil only. Keep edges sealed but leave room inside to puff."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool in foil or airtight container. Refrigerate up to 2 days. Reheat foil packets in oven or microwave gently. Avoid grilling again, dries fish. Potatoes reheat well, asparagus can get softer."
