ingredients:
- "1 tbsp butter"
- "8 oz scallops, rinsed and patted dry"
- "8 oz shrimp, peeled and deveined"
- "1/3 cup red bell pepper, diced, divided"
- "1/4 cup red onion, chopped"
- "2 garlic cloves, minced"
- "1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated"
- "1 1/2 tbsp red curry paste"
- "3 tbsp lime juice, divided"
- "1/4 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped"
- "1 cup coconut milk (full fat)"
- "2 cups vegetable broth"
- "1/3 cup corn kernels (fresh or frozen)"
- "2 scallions, sliced"
- "Maldon salt flakes, to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat butter over medium in a medium saucepan. Toss in scallops and shrimp, stir occasionally just until opaque and edges curl. No overcooking or they go rubbery. Remove seafood from pan, set aside on plate."
- "Same pan, toss in 1/3 cup red bell pepper, red onion, garlic, and ginger. Listen for that soft sizzle, veggies should start to soften and smell sharp but not burnt—roughly 2-3 minutes. Toss in curry paste, stir constantly until fragrance punches through – about 1 minute. Be mindful of burning spices here; low-medium heat is key."
- "Pour in 2 tbsp lime juice, stir in basil leaves, coconut milk, and veggie broth. Whisk gently to marry the liquids, no lumps. Bring to low simmer, watch for tiny bubbles around edges, reduce heat if boiling hard. Let it bubble soft 9-11 minutes, slightly thickening but still loose. Avoid a boil that breaks coconut fat; surface looks silky when ready."
- "While broth simmers, mix remaining red bell pepper and corn with cooked seafood. Toss gently without breaking scallops. This mixture gets warmed by hot broth later; no second cooking needed, protects texture."
- "Divide seafood and veggie mix into two bowls. Ladle the hot coconut broth over carefully, hear that steam hiss. Finish with sliced scallions, sprinkle Maldon salt flakes for crunch, and drizzle remaining lime juice to punch up brightness. Adjust salt cautiously; Maldon flakes offer texture and clean saltiness without overwhelming."
- "Taste, tweak acidity or salt as needed. If broth feels flat, another squeeze of lime or small pinch of sugar can balance. Remember, this is a play between creamy, tart, spicy, and savory."
introduction: "Seafood with coconut and Thai spice—an obvious win. Not complicated, but details matter. Scallops and shrimp, but not drowned in sauce; their texture should snap without rubberiness sneaking in. Red curry paste, garlic, and ginger setting the stage with aroma that wakes the senses before you even taste. Coconut milk’s creaminess balanced with lime’s sharp pop and fresh basil’s herbaceous twist. Corn and bell pepper adds sweetness and crunch, something I learned watching texture is what really elevates the bowl. Broth simmered low, coaxed gently. No rushing. Maldon salt scattered like tiny surprises while lime juice finishes the punch. This isn’t just soup; it’s balance and timing finely tuned. Tried many ways but dialing the simmer and not overcooking seafood changed everything. When the recipe calls for red bell pepper, I nudge that a bit to boost freshness and texture. Subbing vegetable broth for seafood stock keeps this accessible without losing punch."
ingredientsNote: "Butter for richness but use ghee or coconut oil if lactose intolerant or need more tropical tone. Scallops and shrimp fresh is best; frozen works but drain well to avoid excess water. Red bell pepper divided to maintain freshness, soggy bell pepper when cooked too long ruins that bright snap. Fresh garlic and ginger—don’t skip fresh, dried won’t cut the sharpness and zing essential to Thai. Red curry paste can vary wildly in heat and flavor intensity—start lighter and add more if needed. Lime juice split changes timing; adding some early softens curry flavor, final drizzle keeps brightness alive. Fresh basil adds sweetness and floral notes; can use Thai basil or swap cilantro cautiously if that’s all you have. Coconut milk full fat gives creaminess but light version works, just less body. Vegetable broth is a subtle base that lets the seafood and spices shine but beef or chicken broth can work in a pinch with flavor tweaks. Corn kernels fresh or frozen adds unexpected pop, frozen slightly sweet that fresh nail a texture contrast. Maldon salt finish is key—coarse flakes add crunch, regular salt won’t do the texture trick."
instructionsNote: "Cooking seafood first in butter, no overcooking—edges become opaque with slight firmness but not rubbery. Tossing them out early preserves texture; they’ll absorb flavors later in broth heat. Same pan, no washing to retain buttery fond flavor. Heat medium-low for veggies and spices, stir garlic ginger and peppers until they soften, aroma jumps before color deepens. Add curry paste, watch for blooming spice aroma to release properly—avoiding burnt paste is key. Lime juice early softens the curry’s sharp edges, then basil added to incorporate herbal lift inside broth. Coconut milk whisked in gently avoids fat separation. Simmer low, bubbles gentle—not rapid boil—broth should develop silk sheen. Broth reduces slightly but remains loose, pouring texture is crucial for soup not stew. Combining corn and bell pepper with seafood before ladling broth keeps textures alive; hot broth finishes warming without overcooking again. Finishing toppings layered last for texture and brightness—essential balance. Maldon salt adds subtle crunch and clean salty pop that normal salt lacks. Final lime juice splash is about that last punch—don’t skip. Adjust acidity and salt based on taste; acidity can cut through richness, sugar can tame over-bright lime or curry paste. Timing matters but visual and sensory cues trump clocks."
tips:
- "Butter browns fast; medium heat only, no rush. Toss seafood early, just opaque edges but not stiff; rubbery kills texture. Use same pan for veggies; fond saves flavor. Watch garlic not burn; sizzle and soft not dark. Curry paste needs stirring constant; aroma blooms before spice hits full. Low-medium heat key; don’t scorch or curry turns bitter. Lime juice early rounds heat, but wait to drizzle rest last second."
- "Divide fresh bell pepper; first batch sweats with onions and ginger, soft aroma fills air but keep bright. Toss remaining raw bell pepper with corn and seafood after cooking broth. Keeps crunchy snap; cooked bell pepper mush kills freshness. Corn frozen or fresh? Both work but frozen brings slight sweet note that pops well. Scallops dry well before sear; moisture stalls caramelization and makes soggy edges."
- "Simmer broth gently, bubbles small at edges only, boil breaks coconut fat which splits. Silk surface shimmer is chef’s signal. Whisk coconut milk carefully in to keep fattiness together, no lumps or separation. Liquid stays loose, no stew thickness; pouring consistency matters for spoon and bite balance. Watch cook time 9-11 minutes max, flavor deepens but broth holds lightness."
- "Seafood gets warmed last by hot broth; no second cooking step to keep scallops snap alive. Toss gently with remaining veggies mix. Maldon salt flakes finish with crunchy pop on top, not dissolved salt. Avoid regular salt here; no texture means flat salt, Maldon adds bite and clean hit. Basil can swap Thai or Italian fresh if needed; swap cilantro cautiously, herbaceous note shifts dish character."
- "Balance acidity with lime juice last; squeeze too early dulls brightness. If broth feels dull or a touch flat, small pinch sugar tempers curry edge without sweetness overkill. Timing is timing; sensory cues—aroma, sizzle, shimmer—beat clocks. Seafood opaque edges, curry fragrance popping, broth silky shine. Each step layered with attention, no shortcuts. Veggie color and crunch shapes final mouthfeel. Timing controls flavor release, texture locked in place."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid rubbery seafood? a: Cook scallops and shrimp early in butter, only until edges turn opaque. Don’t overcook; takes seconds longer. Set seafood aside. Toss with veggies later, warmed by broth heat, no more cooking. Keeps snap intact, no rubbery chew."
- "q: Can I substitute broth? a: Vegetable broth most neutral to let spices sing. Chicken broth adds body but shifts flavor to more savory. Beef broth not recommended unless heavy flavor wanted. Coconut milk type affects creaminess; full fat thickens soup, light keeps it looser."
- "q: How to prevent coconut milk curdling? a: Gentle simmer only, no hard boil. Watch bubbles, tiny around edge, not rapid. Whisk coconut milk in slowly, blend with lime juice and broth before heat rises. Heating too fast breaks fat-emulsion and gives grainy texture; be cautious here."
- "q: How long can leftovers keep? a: Fridge 2-3 days sealed well, seafood best eaten sooner. Reheat gently, low stove or microwave in bursts to avoid rubbery seafood. Freeze not advised; texture breaks, coconut milk separates. Fresh lime juice freshens again after storage."
