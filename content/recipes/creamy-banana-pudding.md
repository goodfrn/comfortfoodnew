title: "Creamy Banana Pudding"
slug: "creamy-banana-pudding"
description: "A creamy banana pudding layered with crumbly shortbread and fresh banana slices. The pudding uses a combination of egg yolks and a whole egg for richness, thickened gently on low heat to avoid curdling. Fold in butter and vanilla for depth. Chill to let flavors meld and cookies soften. Whipped cream topping adds lightness. A classic dessert with a subtle twist using cornstarch instead of flour, offering a silkier texture. Easy to make, rewarding every spoonful with creamy sweetness, soft crunch, and fruity brightness."
metaDescription: "Creamy Banana Pudding layered with crumbled shortbread and fresh banana slices. Thickened with cornstarch and rich egg yolks, chilled to meld flavors and soften cookies."
ogDescription: "Layered banana pudding with shortbread crunch and silky cornstarch-thickened custard. Chill well for soft cookies and bright banana flavor. Whipped cream tops it off."

ingredients:
- "4 eggs"
- "3 cups whole milk"
- "3/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/4 cup cornstarch"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "3 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "8 bananas, sliced"
- "1 1/3 cups shortbread cookies, crumbled"
- "whipped cream for topping"
instructions:
- "Separate yolks from 3 eggs. Save whites for another use or discard. In a medium bowl, whisk whole last egg with milk; set aside."
- "In a saucepan over low heat, combine sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Stir dry mix well to prevent lumps."
- "Slowly pour in the egg and milk mixture, stirring constantly to blend smooth before heating."
- "Keep heat low. Stir continuously, scraping bottom and sides. Watch for pudding to thicken but do not let it bubble or boil or risk curdling."
- "After about 10-11 minutes, pudding thickens enough to coat a spoon thickly. Remove from heat immediately."
- "Stir in butter and vanilla until butter melts fully and blends into pudding. This adds richness and shine."
- "Optional: Press pudding through a fine mesh sieve if your mixture feels lumpy — but if smooth, skip this. Texture only."
- "Transfer pudding to a clean bowl. Cover surface with plastic wrap to prevent skin and refrigerate for about an hour or until chilled and set."
- "Assemble cups: spoon some pudding into 8 cups, sprinkle crumbled shortbread, then banana slices. Repeat layering 2 more times or until cups fill."
- "Chill assembled cups at least an hour to soften cookies and meld flavors."
- "Serve cold with a dollop of whipped cream and extra cookie crumbs or banana slices."
- "Listen for that gentle bubbling stop, smell the vanilla and butter mixing, feel the silky pudding thickening — all signs you’re nearly done."
introduction: "Banana pudding isn’t rocket science but hit the right texture and you’ve got magic. I ditched flour for cornstarch here — smoother, silkier and less risk of pastiness from overcooked starch. Separating yolks makes pudding richer but saving whites is key; never waste eggs, use for meringue or omelets. Heat low and slow — too hot and it turns grainy. I’ve had puddings curdle from impatience. The layering is crucial, too. Shortbread absorbs moisture and softens but doesn’t go to mush if you chill enough. The fresh banana balances richness with brightness. Topping with whipped cream? Worth the extra few minutes. A home-run in a cup, every bite tells you why patience and technique matter."
ingredientsNote: "Egg count balance is important — yolks thicken and enrich, whole egg lightens texture. If in a pinch, swap cornstarch for flour but reduce it slightly, 3 tablespoons would do. Milk can be whole or 2% but avoid alternatives for best thickening. Butter adds silk and richness; sub with coconut oil for dairy-free but flavor shifts. Vanilla extract is non-negotiable, the aroma brings pudding from bland to bright. Shortbread cookies are my go-to for crunch and buttery flavor — if unavailable, graham crackers or vanilla wafers work, just keep an eye on softness after chilling. Bananas should be ripe but firm to slice easily and hold shape in layers. Whipped cream on top can be fresh or canned fudge topping, add that contrast of textures. Egg whites reserved? Freeze or make pavlova, angel food cake, or protein-rich scramble."
instructionsNote: "Egg separation—do this first; yolk temperature impacts pudding setting. Whisk whole egg with milk to prevent lumps later. Heat mixture on low to avoid scrambling eggs—slow stir, constant attention required. Watch for pudding thick enough to coat back of a spoon with a finger swipe leaving a clear path. No boiling allowed or risk grainy texture or curdled eggs; gentle thickening only. After removing from heat, butter and vanilla fold in to finish richness and flavor layering; skip butter and pudding loses silkiness. Sieving is optional but great for removing any cooked egg bits if you overheat slightly. Chill covered to avoid skin forming — plastic pressed onto surface is best. Build cups layered not dumped; layering cookies and banana lets them soak properly without becoming gummy. Refrigerate assembled cups longer than an hour if time permits for best softness and flavor melding. Serve cold. Tactile cues: pudding is thick but still spoonable, cookies soften but hold slight bite, bananas fresh, cream airy. If pudding too runny, chill longer or add small cornstarch slurry reheated gently. If pudding too thick or pasty, thin with splash milk before chilling."
tips:
- "Separate eggs first. Yolks only for richness. Whites save or toss but don’t waste; meringues or scramble. Whisk whole egg with milk cold, prevents lumps later. Heat pudding low. Stir constantly. No bubbles or boil. Watch consistency thickens slowly. Coat spoon thick like custard. Remove heat right away—overcook curdles pudding easy."
- "Butter folded in off heat. Adds shine and silk. Vanilla is must not skip —flavor fades without. Optional sieve step for lumps. Press through fine mesh if your pudding feels grainy or overcooked. Skipping sieve keeps texture but lumps might show. Cooling covered stops skin forming—plastic wrap tight on surface. Chill at least an hour for layering."
- "Layering counts. Alternate pudding softens shortbread but don’t dump fast. Cookies retain crunch if chilled enough. Bananas ripe but firm stay fresh slice and layering holds. Repeat layers — three total layers build flavor and texture contrast. Refrigerate long if toppings wait. Whipped cream topping brings airiness and light contrast to dense pudding."
- "Cornstarch swap for flour gives silkier texture, less risk grit or pasty. Flour needs less—three tbsp tops. Milk whole or 2% only, no alternatives for thickening. Butter can swap coconut oil but expect flavor shift. Keep heat very low—pudding grainy if rushed. Listen for thickening sounds—quiet bubbling stops are signal to remove from heat."
- "If pudding too thin, refrigerate longer or add cornstarch slurry reheated gently. Too thick or pasty? Thin with splash milk before chilling. Texture key—thick but spoonable. Watch puddings carefully—timing a few minutes off ruins texture. Whipped cream topping fresh or canned fudge style for contrast. Reserve egg whites freeze or make protein dishes."
faq:
- "q: Why separate eggs? a: Yolks add richness. Whites don’t help pudding set. Save whites freezing or making other dishes. Adding whole egg lightens custard but whisk cold with milk first or risk lumps."
- "q: Can flour replace cornstarch? a: Yes but reduce amount—flour thickens more slowly. Cornstarch smoother texture, less pasty risk. Flour might thicken unevenly. Swap 3 tbsp flour if stuck, stir well, watch closely when heating."
- "q: How to avoid curdling? a: Keep heat really low. Stir nonstop. No boiling—quiet thickening only. Remove at pudding coats spoon thickly. High heat cooks eggs too fast—grainy texture or scramble bits happen fast if care lapses."
- "q: How best to store pudding cups? a: Cover with plastic wrap or lid, fridge only. Chill different times okay but longer chill improves texture—cookies soften without mush. Freeze not ideal, changes pudding texture badly."
