ingredients:
- "=== Wasabi Mayonnaise ==="
- "80 ml (1/3 cup plus 1 tbsp) mayonnaise"
- "1 small green onion finely chopped"
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) fresh lime juice"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) prepared wasabi paste"
- "=== Fried Cod and Pickles ==="
- "170 g (1 cup plus 2 tbsp) all purpose flour"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) cold sparkling water"
- "12 ml (1 tbsp) chopped fresh tarragon"
- "400 g (14 oz) cod fillets cut into 4 strips"
- "1 large dill pickle cut into 4 thick slices"
- "Vegetable oil for frying"
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "4 slightly elongated sandwich buns split in half"
- "Boston lettuce leaves"
instructions:
- "=== Wasabi Mayonnaise ==="
- "Chop green onion very fine. Mix with mayo, lime juice, and wasabi until combined and cool. Keep chilled. Bright acid balances the wasabi's fire. We want it sharp but not overpowering."
- "=== Frying Setup ==="
- "Heat oil in deep fryer or heavy pot to 175 C (350 F). Use thermometer, no guesswork here. Oil must be hot but not smoking – battles between soggy and burnt happen right now."
- "=== Batter and Flour Prep ==="
- "Spread out 70 g (1/2 cup plus a spoon) flour on a plate – dry coating step. Mix remaining flour with cold sparkling water and chopped tarragon gently. Mixture must stay lumpy to avoid gluten toughening. Salt, pepper in the batter, taste shows itself after frying."
- "=== Coating and Frying Cod ==="
- "Dust two pieces of fish lightly with dry flour to help batter stick. Dip into batter, let excess drip off, then slide carefully into hot oil. Listen for sizzle that stays steady, not frantic or muffled. Flip after about 3-4 minutes or when golden and puffed, then crisp all around. Drain on wire rack over baking sheet to keep bottom from steaming."
- "=== Frying Pickles ==="
- "Same process for pickles: dry flour first, dip in batter, fry 2-3 minutes until bubbly and golden. Watch close, smaller pieces cook faster. Keep warm but watch so they don’t lose crunch."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Toast cut buns. Spread wasabi mayo thickly on cut sides while warm – spreads easier that way. Layer Boston lettuce to provide cool crunch, then add cod pieces and fried pickles alternately. The hot-cold-cream-crisp mix should hit all points."
- "Serve immediately. Don’t wait – batter can go soggy fast. If needed, rest fish on rack in warm oven (about 90 C) but only for short time."
introduction: "Fried fish sandwiches usually suffer from soggy coats or bland mayo. Tried many pastas and batters for battered cod, this version stands out because of the bubbly lightness from sparkling water and a quick tarragon twist instead of dill. Fried pickles add crunch and a vinegary hit that cuts through richness; the wasabi mayo wakes the palate up with sharp heat and lime brightness. Toasted buns hold their own, stopping everything from sliding apart. The secret is a careful eye on oil temp, batter consistency, and quick assembly. I learned the hard way that too much mixing kills the batter’s bubbles, and too low oil temp leads to oily dullness. Simple but tricky. This isn't about shortcuts but a reliable handling of basic elements."
ingredientsNote: "The swapping of sparkling water for beer cuts down on bitterness and makes the batter more tender. I like tarragon better than dill here; its subtle anise notes mellow the fish without overpowering. Mayonnaise can be replaced by vegan variants if desired; lime instead of lemon adds a gentle tang and less sharpness, balancing the wasabi paste intensity. Pickles? Kosher or thicker sliced dill versions work well. Buns should be fresh but firm – fine crumb absorbs oil or sauces too quickly, making a mess. Lettuce Boston because it’s sturdy yet tender, stops soggy bites. Adjust oil amount based on fryer size, keep extra hot oil handy in case temp drops. Flour must be fresh, or batter timing falters."
instructionsNote: "Mixing the batter till just combined is crucial; over-mixing breaks gluten and the batter loses its frothiness, turning dense and heavy. I use a fork for minimal mixing and stop when wet ingredients are just incorporated with flour lumps still visible. Frying timing varies slightly by thickness but watch color and blistering bubbles on surface – golden means ready. Don’t overcrowd the fryer or oil temp drops off, causing greasy layers. Between batches, maintain heat and drain fish and pickles on wire racks, never paper towels – they trap steam and ruin crispness. Toasting buns before applying mayo prevents sogginess and improves flavor. Assemble last minute – fried batter goes limp quickly when sitting."
tips:
- "Oil temp crucial here. 175 C steady heat keeps batter crisp without burning fish. Watch for steady sizzle sound not frantic pop or silence. If oil smokes, turn down. Lower temp = oily, limp coating. Use thermometer no guessing."
- "Batter lumps okay. Mix flour, cold sparkling water, tarragon just till combined. Overmix kills bubbles, makes batter heavy and chewier. Fork works better than whisk. Keep cold ingredients cold for better bubbles. Light *not* smooth batter."
- "Dust fish/pickles with dry flour before batter dip. Stops batter from sliding off and slick oil splatter later. Fish strips need gentle handling; batter weight breaks without dry flour base. Pickles cook faster watch carefully. Smaller pieces burn or soak oil."
- "Drain fried pieces on wire rack over tray not paper towels. Paper traps steam under. Results? Soggy bottom and limp coating. Let hot air circulate under fish and pickles keeps crust crisp. Heat holding oven low 90 C works but short time only."
- "Toast buns lightly but keep soft center. Full crunch buns soak oil or mayo quick = mess. Slice hot mayo spreads easier, layer cold Boston lettuce for fresh crunch. Assemble last minute. The temperature contrast key for bite satisfaction; warm fish, cold pickles, mayo, lettuce."
faq:
- "q: Can mayonnaise be replaced? a: Vegan mayo works same way. Texture similar. Lime juice swaps well for lemon but less sharp. Wasabi paste potency varies brands taste before mixing."
- "q: What if batter is too thick or thin? a: Too thick = heavy coating, dull bubbles. Add more cold sparkling water 1 tbsp at a time. Too thin = runs off fish, blisters break. Adjust flour or water slowly not fast. Lumps stay okay."
- "q: How to keep fried pickles crispy? a: Drain on wire rack, no stacking. Smaller pieces faster cook watch color for golden bubbles. Serve soon after frying. If made ahead reheat briefly in dry pan or low oven, no microwave traps moisture."
- "q: Can batter be stored or made ahead? a: No, bubbles die quickly. Mix only right before frying. Flour ages affect batter timing. Keep flour fresh. If cold batter sits too long bubbles vanish, coating dull, heavier texture results."
