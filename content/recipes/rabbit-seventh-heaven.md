title: "Rabbit Seventh Heaven"
slug: "rabbit-seventh-heaven"
description: "A rustic rabbit stew enriched with Caribbean dark rum and carrot juice. Butter-browned rabbit pieces become tender through slow simmering. The process involves repeated moistening with carrot juice, developing layers, no heavy cream or nuts. Uses standard pantry items but switches rum proportions and carrot juice volumes for a lighter, nuanced sauce. A twist with shallots instead of onions shifts aroma subtly. Ideal for those craving game with a lively citrus edge in sauce. Simple seasoning; all about patience and attentive simmering. Common pitfalls include overcooking or letting the sauce dry out. Serve with fragrant black mushroom rice for earthiness balance. A confident cook's dish – no shortcuts. You’ll learn to watch, smell, and nudge the pot, not just time it."

ingredients:
- "1 large rabbit cut into 8 pieces"
- "50 ml clarified butter or ghee (about 3 1/2 tbsp)"
- "1 shallot thinly sliced"
- "50 ml Caribbean dark rum"
- "1 litre fresh carrot juice, more if needed"
- "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Start by heating clarified butter in a heavy-bottomed pot. No high heat; medium to medium-low works better to brown without burning."
- "Add rabbit chunks skin-side down first. Let each piece get golden and crispy, about 12 to 15 minutes. Turn only when you see deep color forming. Resist poking or flipping constantly — patience builds flavor."
- "Season with sea salt and black pepper as they brown, don’t wait till the end. This step locks in taste and dries the meat’s surface for better browning."
- "Add sliced shallot, stir gently for about 4 minutes or until soft and translucent, but not browned. Onion can overpower sometimes; shallots add a milder, sweeter touch—my personal tweak here."
- "Pour in the dark rum slowly. You’ll hear a soft sizzle, liquid evaporating. Scrape the brown bits stuck to the bottom with a wooden spoon—this dissolves richness into the sauce."
- "Immediately add about 130 ml carrot juice (a bit more than half a cup). Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low."
- "Cover partially —lid ajar— to let the sauce thicken gradually while moisture stays controlled. Check every 4 minutes or so; add 30-40 ml more carrot juice if it looks dry or rabbit surfaces appear leathery."
- "Keep the stew barely bubbling so pieces remain tender but not falling apart; about 30 to 35 minutes. You’ll see the sauce darken slightly, coat the back of a spoon with a faint sheen."
- "Tap a piece with a fork. The meat should be tender, give without shredding. If tough, simmer a bit longer with additional carrot juice; no rush, no jerky bites."
- "Adjust seasoning now, salt and pepper to your liking. The rum must peek subtly, not bite or overwhelm."
- "Turn off heat; let sit covered 5 minutes so flavors settle."
- "Serve alongside djon djon black mushroom rice or any earthy starch to balance sweetness and gamey notes."
introduction: "Rabbit is game with a light but dense flavor. I've approached it many ways but found the key is patient browning and careful liquid addition. Carrot juice replaces heavier stocks or cream, keeping the dish vibrant and digestible. Caribbean rum adds character, not just alcohol, but a deep caramel aroma that melds with the natural sweetness of the carrot. Shallots, rather than onions, give a cleaner edge to the smell without bitterness creeping in. Watch the sauce as it bubbles gently, adjusting moisture little by little — too dry and the rabbit toughens, too wet and it loses concentration. This method taught me much about subtle hands-off simmering, and I swear by it now, especially with rabbit’s mild taste. Pair with a textured mushroom rice for contrast and depth. Curious cooks should try this twist, adjust sugar or acidity separately if needed but keep it simple. The real work here? Listening to the pot more than staring at the clock."
ingredientsNote: "Clarified butter or ghee is better than regular butter here to avoid burning at the browning stage. If unavailable, use melted coconut oil but expect a slightly different aroma. Shallots replace onions intentionally; they caramelize softer and are less sulfurous. Caribbean dark rum can be swapped for aged spiced rum or a deep aged whiskey if you want a different pungency. Carrot juice’s sweetness balances the gamey bite — fresh is always best but use high-quality store-bought in a pinch. Keep an eye on juice volume; too much dilutes flavor, too little risks scorching. Sea salt preferred over regular table salt, cleaner taste and mineral notes. Black pepper freshly cracked makes a world of difference. Don’t shortcut by skipping the deglazing step — those browned bits hold umami gold. Experiment with a splash of apple cider vinegar or lemon zest not in the original if your nose tells you to brighten it at the end."
instructionsNote: "Browning the rabbit patiently is non-negotiable. High heat leads to black burnt pieces, bitter on palate. Medium or medium-low — wait for good coloration before turning. Don’t crowd the pot or you steam the meat instead. Removing excess moisture on surfaces with paper towels before browning helps. Adding shallots after browning means they soften gently without turning bitter. Surface browning proofs flavor depth, don’t skip. Pouring rum after shallot softening lets alcohol deglaze without scorching the meat. Scraping the fond is crucial; many miss this savory layer hiding at the bottom. Carrot juice added gradually keeps moisture steady, prevents the stew from boiling dry, which toughens rabbit. Avoid full lid unless too watery — partial cover balances evaporation and retention. Simmer gently, no roaring boil, bubbles about once per second. Use fork pressure on thickest piece to test doneness; it should yield easily but not shred apart. Salt and pepper last stage tweaks brightness. Always rest before serving for juices to settle. Djon djon rice on the side is old-school but amazing, earthy aroma and chewy texture marry game beautifully. If djon djon mushrooms unavailable, use shiitake or porcini risotto instead."
tips:
- "Brown rabbit patiently medium heat only. Skin-side down first. Wait for color deepening before flipping. No constant poking. Builds flavor layers internally. Dry meat surface helps. Paper towels before pan helps too. Avoid crowding; steam kills browning. Brown bits on bottom hold umami. Scrape after deglaze with dark rum. Crucial step often skipped. Butter or ghee gives clean caramel, less burning than regular butter or oil. Don’t rush."
- "Carrot juice added gradually. Start with about 130 ml, then small increments to keep stew moist but not watery. Watch sauce consistency every 4 minutes. Too dry makes meat tough, too much dilutes flavors. Partial lid control evaporation and moisture balance. Simmer gently—tiny bubbles, about one per second. Not boiling. Stir gently if needed but mostly watch for aroma and sauce color change. Sauce should darken, coat spoon back faintly shiny."
- "Shallots softening time important, about 4 minutes after browning rabbit. No browning or bitterness desired here. Onion would overpower, shallots bring sweetness and subtlety without sulfur bite. Stir gently—avoid fast sizzling or high heat here. Layered aroma builds from this stage. Dark rum pouring after shallots soft is deliberate: deglazing deepens flavor without scorching alcohol. Let sizzle softly."
- "Rest stew covered 5 minutes after turning off heat. Juice redistributes, flavors settle. Check seasoning now. Sea salt preferred for mineral balance. Fresh cracked black pepper brings sharpness but add last stage. Rum must peek subtly, not dominate or burn throat. If stew tastes flat, adjust salt and pepper carefully. Test meat doneness by fork pressure—tender, yielding but meat stays intact. If tough, add carrot juice, simmer longer patiently."
- "Substitutions worth noting. Use ghee or clarified butter for clean browning. Coconut oil works but alters aroma, expect tropical hints. Caribbean dark rum can swap for aged spiced rum or aged whiskey for different spice profile. Carrot juice freshness critical; store-bought is fallback if fresh unavailable but quality matters. Djon djon mushroom rice traditional side. If missing, shiitake or porcini risotto works for earthy contrast. Apple cider vinegar or lemon zest optional finishes if aroma feels flat but add cautiously."
faq:
- "q: How to know when rabbit is done? a: Press thickest chunk with fork. Should yield, spring back slow. No shredding apart. If tough, add carrot juice. Simmer longer low heat. Use nose too. Sauce smell deepen dark caramel hints. Soft but not mushy."
- "q: What to do if sauce dries out? a: Add carrot juice bit by bit. Partial lid keeps moisture, no full seal unless watery. Watch every 4 minutes. Stir if sauce sticks. Too much juice dilutes flavors though, balance is key. Better small additions, patience."
- "q: Can I use regular butter? a: Not recommended. Butter burns quicker so risk bitterness during browning. Clarified butter or ghee preferred, cleaner fat, higher smoke point. Coconut oil alternative but shifts aroma. Don’t skip fat, it builds flavor crust on rabbit skin side."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly, fridge up to 2 days. Reheat gently low heat adding splash carrot juice for moisture. Freezer okay if tightly wrapped, lose some sauce brightness after thaw. Avoid microwaving fast or toughens meat. Let rest after warming before serving again."
