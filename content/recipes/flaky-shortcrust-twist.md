ingredients:
- "320 g (2 1/3 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "1.5 ml (1/3 teaspoon) salt"
- "160 g (3/4 cup) cold vegan butter substitute, diced"
- "90 ml (6 tablespoons) chilled coconut water or unsweetened plant-based yogurt"
instructions:
- "=== Food Processor ==="
- "1 In processor, pulse together flour and salt. Add vegan butter, pulse short bursts until pea-sized chunks visible."
- "2 Gradually add coconut water or plant yogurt, pulse till dough starts clumping but not sticky. Add more liquid teaspoon by teaspoon if needed."
- "3 Remove dough, form 2 discs, wrap in plastic wrap."
- "4 Chill 20 to 25 minutes minimum before rolling out."
- "=== By Hand ==="
- "1 Stir flour and salt in large bowl. Using pastry cutter or two knives, cut in vegan butter until mix is crumbly with small lumps the size of peas."
- "2 Add chilled coconut water or plant yogurt bit by bit, fold to combine with spatula. Dough should just hold when pressed gently. Add more liquid sparingly."
- "3 Form 2 discs, wrap tightly in plastic."
- "4 Refrigerate at least 20 minutes to rest fats and hydrate flour."
- "=== Rolling and Use ==="
- "5 On lightly floured surface or parchment sheets, roll dough discs to 3-4 mm (about 1/8 inch) thickness."
- "6 Use immediately for single or double crust pies, tartelettes, quiches about 22 to 24 cm (8.5 to 9.5 inch) diameter."
- "7 Any scraps can be gently kneaded and re-rolled but avoid overworking."
introduction: "Flaky dough with bites of fat. Vegan butter swapped in. Coconut water instead of plain water. Keeps crust tender but workable. Salt rounds out flavor. Two discs fit small to medium pie plates, thin rolled. Chill time trimmed to 20 minutes but no less. Mix in food processor or by hand. Dough breaks a little, flour uneven spots are fine. No eggs. No dairy. Nutfree. Moves fast, stays cool. Good base for savory, sweets. In its simplicity, becomes something else when fillings get their turn. Rolling and chilling make all the difference. Stays crisp. No heavy steps. Kitchen tool ready, hands brush flour. Parchment friendly. It’s a starting place, not a finish line."
ingredientsNote: "Flour choice matters. Unbleached all-purpose for better texture. Cold vegan butter essential maintaining flaky pockets. Butter substitutes vary in water content, check fat percentage near 80% ideal. Salt small at about 1/3 teaspoon means balanced salty background. Replacing water with coconut water adds subtle sweetness and depth, contrasts slight tang of plant yogurt option alternative. Yogurt variant must be plain and unsweetened to avoid overpowering dough. Liquid always ice cold to prevent early gluten development. Gradual liquid addition prevents sticky dough and keeps structure loose. Mixing times short, fats remain pea-sized rather than melted."
instructionsNote: "Food processor pulsing prevents heat buildup, preserves fat chunks. Short pulses preferable to blending straight through. If overmixed, dough binds, tough crust. Hand method demands cutting fat even smaller than chicken peas but not fully combined. Fold-in with spatula avoids gluten overwork, protecting tenderness. Work quickly to keep dough cold. Plastic wrap essential freeze-like barrier. Chill tightly covered minimum 20 minutes, max 30, else dough hardens and cracks when rolling. Roll between parchment sheets to minimal flour use and easy transfer. Thickness consistent saves baking issues. Rest dough before baking, reduces shrinkage. Dough usable for sweet or savory. Double crust needs pie dough crack avoidance steps: holes poked or blind-baked weights recommended."
tips:
- "Flour choice is key. Unbleached all-purpose gives that flaky texture. Cold vegan butter is a must. Keep it cold to maintain firmness. Let it stay firm."
- "Avoid over-mixing. Food processor or hands, it needs short bursts. Just pulse to keep pea-sized bits. No blending. It's about texture, not smooth."
- "Chill the dough. Minimum 20 minutes, maximum 30. This avoids cracks later. Too long? It hardens. Too short? It’s sticky."
- "Roll between parchment sheets. Easy transfer and reduces flour use. Consistent thickness is vital, saves issues during baking. No gaps, no surprises."
- "Don’t forget to poke holes in double crusts. Prevent bubbling. Use blind baking weights if needed. Gets crisp, avoids soggy bottoms."
faq:
- "q: Can I freeze the dough? a: Yes, freeze tightly wrapped. Lasts up to 3 months. Just thaw in fridge overnight. Then roll."
- "q: What if it cracks when rolling? a: Keep it cold. No heat from hands. If cracks, patch with scraps. Don't reroll too much."
- "q: Can this be made gluten-free? a: Substituting gluten-free flour is possible. Just be aware of texture differences. More crumbly."
- "q: What's the best filling? a: Savory or sweet, both work. Try fruits for sweet or veggies for savory. Balance is key in flavors."
