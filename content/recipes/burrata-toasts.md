ingredients:
- "=== Roasted tomatoes ==="
- "200 g (1 1/3 cups) mixed-color cherry tomatoes halved"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) sherry vinegar"
- "1/2 ml (1/8 tsp) salt"
- "freshly cracked black pepper"
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "4 large eggs"
- "4 slices country-style bread, toasted"
- "1 garlic clove halved"
- "1 ball burrata 300 g, room temperature, drained and torn"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) chives cut in 1.5 cm pieces"
- "flaky sea salt"
- "crushed chili flakes (optional)"
instructions:
- "=== Roasted tomatoes ==="
- "1. Set oven rack mid-level. Heat oven to 210 °C (410 °F). Line baking sheet with parchment or reusable mat."
- "2. In a bowl, combine tomatoes, olive oil, maple syrup, sherry vinegar, salt, pepper. Mix and let sit for 7 minutes to marinade lightly."
- "3. Drain excess liquid thoroughly. Arrange tomatoes cut side up on the sheet."
- "4. Roast in oven 18 minutes or until tomatoes soften, shrivel slightly, develop golden edges."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "5. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering but not smoking."
- "6. Crack eggs gently into skillet, cook on one side 2 to 4 minutes until whites set and edges crisp without flipping."
- "7. Rub toasted bread slices with the garlic halves while eggs cook, infusing subtle flavor."
- "8. Distribute burrata evenly on toasts. Spoon roasted tomatoes over cheese. Sprinkle with chopped chives."
- "9. Top each toast with a fried egg. Season with flaky sea salt and optional crushed chili flakes."
- "10. Serve immediately. The warm tomatoes with sharp vinegar, sweet maple, creamy burrata, and rich egg yolk mingle."
introduction: "Bursting tomatoes roasted until their skins wrinkle, tiny bursts of acidity sweetened with maple syrup. Eggs fried long enough to develop crunchy edges but keep yolks runny deep golden. Bread grilled then rubbed with pungent raw garlic. Burrata torn into pillowy chunks that sit like clouds on toasted bread. Fresh chives add subtle bite. Flaky salt crystals crackle with each bite. Chilies optional, bring dry heat flickers. Sherry vinegar swapped for wine vinegar, maple replaces honey, brightness shifts. Time stretched here and there to coax flavors deeper. Simple, rustic, a bite of late summer in every mouthful. No fuss, just contrast: creamy and tangy, soft and crisp, sweet and savory. Jumbled steps, but all bits land perfectly together."
ingredientsNote: "Cherry tomatoes vary in sweetness and acidity, so tasting before roasting helps balance syrup and vinegar. Choose colorful ones for visual interest. Maple syrup adds a woody sweetness distinct from honey, slightly less viscous allowing better coating. Sherry vinegar brings a nutty sharpness; wine vinegar was replaced here for a cleaner, brighter edge to contrast creamy burrata. Burrata should be at room temp so it melts slightly on the warm toasts. Garlic rub on bread infuses subtle aroma without overpowering. Olive oil quality matters—fruitier oils brighten the tomatoes and eggs. Chives cut thick for texture rather than finely minced. Flaky salt scattered last to maintain crunch and hits of salinity. Chili flakes optional but recommended for those who want a spark. Toast slices thick enough to hold toppings but not dense, rustic country bread ideal."
instructionsNote: "Oven temperature raised slightly and roasting extended by a few minutes to deepen caramelization on tomatoes. Marinate tomatoes 7 minutes instead of 5 to infuse more flavor without sogging them. Drain before roasting to avoid steaming. Eggs fried gently in ample olive oil, edges crisp and golden while whites set soft over yolks not flipped so yolks remain runny. Garlic-rubbed toast adds aroma layer that cuts richness of cheese and egg. Burrata torn rather than sliced to vary texture. Assembly is casual—don't overwork to keep rustic effect. Freshly cut chives scattered last for brightness and snap. Salt and chili flakes only after plating preserves texture and punch. Serve right away so tomatoes retain warmth and eggs don’t cool too much. Pantry swaps refocus flavor balance, bringing fresh twists and slight acidity adjustments. Timing tweaks coax deeper color and texture contrasts."
tips:
- "Marinate cherry tomatoes longer than usual - 7 minutes instead of 5. Helps vinegar and maple syrup soak in without sogging. Drain thoroughly before roasting to prevent steaming. Use parchment or silicone mats on baking sheets for easy cleanup and even roasting. Tomatoes roast best cut side up - lets edges shrivel, caramelize better. Colorful varieties add interest but balance acidity by tasting before hand."
- "Fry eggs gently on medium-high in plenty of good olive oil. Wait until oil shimmers but does not smoke before adding. Crack eggs carefully. No flipping. Cook 2 to 4 minutes until edges crisp but yolks remain runny. Gives a contrast in textures. The crispy edges add crunch to creamy yolks. The amount of oil matters - helps crisp edges but keeps whites tender underneath."
- "Rub warm toasted country bread with halved garlic cloves immediately after toasting. Use rustic, thick slices that hold toppings without falling apart. Bread should not be dense or too thin. Garlic aroma layers without overpowering. Olive oil quality matters here too - fruitier oils brighten the whole bite when drizzled over or used in tomatoes and eggs. Warm burrata melts slightly on toast but keep torn chunks, don’t slice."
- "Chives cut into 1.5 cm sticks give textural bite, not just flavor. Too fine and they disappear. Scatter fresh right before serving to maintain snap and brightness. Flaky salt sprinkled last adds crunch and sharp seasoning spots. Crushed chili flakes optional, add flickers of dry heat to balance creaminess and sweetness. Timing important - serve immediately to keep tomatoes warm and yolks runny."
- "Roast tomatoes at higher temp 210 °C (410 °F) for deeper caramelization. Extended roasting by a few minutes. Watch closely, they’ll shrivel and edges golden. Marinate tomatoes longer before roasting to infuse deeper flavor - sweet, tangy balance. Drain before roasting to avoid sogginess or steaming. Egg frying technique critical: edges crisp, whites set, yolks runny. Don’t flip. Assemble casually to keep rustic, varied textures intact."
faq:
- "q: How to keep egg yolks runny while frying? a: Cook eggs without flipping. Medium-high but not smoking oil. 2 to 4 minutes until whites set fully and edges get crispy. Watch time closely. Too long, yolks firm. Use fresh eggs for best texture."
- "q: Can I use other vinegars instead of sherry vinegar? a: Yes, but acidity and flavor change. Wine vinegar used here for brightness. Apple cider vinegar gives fruitier notes, balsamic brings sweetness but darker color. Adjust maple syrup to balance vinegar sharpness accordingly."
- "q: Why drain tomatoes before roasting? a: Prevents sogginess from excess marinade liquid. Draining helps tomatoes roast dry, caramelize edges. Steaming avoided. Otherwise tomatoes soften but get mushy, lose texture contrast needed for this toasty dish."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Tomatoes keep ok in fridge for a day, but lose crispness. Burrata best fresh, avoid refrigerating torn chunks long. Eggs don’t reheat well runny, so cook fresh if possible. Toast can be stored separately, but better toasted fresh."
