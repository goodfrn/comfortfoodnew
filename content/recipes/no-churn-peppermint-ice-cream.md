title: "No Churn Peppermint Ice Cream"
slug: "no-churn-peppermint-ice-cream"
description: "Frozen treat whipped up without a machine. Uses sweetened condensed milk, heavy cream, and peppermint bits. Chill metal loaf pan first to hasten freezing. Whip cream to stiff peaks—a crucial texture check. Folding technique matters for lightness. Two-stage freezing with initial set then candy mix-in. Peppermint adds crunch and aroma right before long freeze. Common swap: crushed Andes mints for peppermint. Timing flexible; rely on texture and coldness cues. No artificial stabilizers, so expect slight iciness if not folded gently. Make ahead, patience required."

ingredients:
- "2cups heavy whipping cream"
- "1can (14oz) sweetened condensed milk (reduce to 13oz for less sweetness)"
- "1tsp pure vanilla extract"
- "1/4tsp fine sea salt"
- "1cup crushed peppermint candies (or substitute Andes mints for softer texture)"
instructions:
- "Start by chilling a 9-inch metal loaf pan in the freezer minimum 55 minutes; cold container prevents slushiness."
- "In a bowl, whisk together sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and salt. No rushing here; salt sharpens flavor layers."
- "Using a stand mixer with whisk attachment or a chilled metal bowl, whip heavy cream to stiff peaks. Look for firm, distinct peaks that don't droop when you lift the whisk. Takes roughly 2–2.5 minutes with a cold bowl; warm cream won’t whip properly."
- "Gently fold one cup of the whipped cream into the sweetened condensed milk mixture. Folding preserves air and prevents deflating; sloppy mixing will yield dense ice cream. Then fold in remaining whipped cream until uniform but still fluffy."
- "Pour that cloud-like mixture into your chilled metal pan. Important to cover tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil to avoid ice crystals."
- "Freeze the pan for about 2 hours—or until the edges start feeling firm, the center slightly yielding. Not hard solid yet."
- "Remove pan and fold in the crushed peppermint candies. Candy pieces give crunch and bursts of peppermint aroma on each bite. Don’t stir too aggressively; you want mix-ins dispersed but not melted."
- "Cover again and freeze for another 7 to 22 hours. Texture firm, scoopable but not icy—test by poking spoon gently."
- "If no peppermint candies, crushed candy canes or chopped Andes mints work. Avoid liquid peppermint extract; concentration can freeze oddly and taste medicinal."
- "Beginners frequently over-whip cream or fold too aggressively—both crush air pockets. Whipped cream volume dictates final creaminess. On humid days, use chilled bowls and beaters."
- "If metal pan unavailable, glass loaf pan will do but freeze time will increase and texture may be softer."
- "No electric mixer? Whisk by hand but takes longer and forearms get taxed—look for slow forming peaks and avoid over-whipping bitter fatty taste."
- "Peppermint candy timing crucial. Mix in too soon candy partially melts and flavor loss follows."
- "Serve straight from freezer; let sit 5 minutes for easier scooping. Shiny foil cover traps aromas better than plastic wrap."
introduction: "Ice cream no machine. Sounds too good? Found out the trick: cold metal pan plus whipped cream aeration is pure magic. Sweetened condensed milk stands in for creaminess and sugar—cuts down on freeze solid nightmare. Tried folding gently every time—you see when it looks fluffy not deflated? Essential. Peppermint candy crush last minute avoids soggy bits and fake taste. No fancy churner, no crying over icy lumps. All about cues—whip peaks, cold pan, freeze until sides firm then candy, then freeze again. Otherwise, it’s crunch or no crunch. My seasoned take: skip extract, skip plastic wrap, chase cold surfaces. Experiment? Sure. Use Andes mints softer crunch or chopped chocolate shards for a twist. Each batch, a lesson in patience and texture."
ingredientsNote: "Heavy cream is the workhorse here; best if very cold, full fat. Avoid ultra-pasteurized for better whipping properties. Sweetened condensed milk provides both sugar and density, cutting down on water content that freezes into ice crystals. Vanilla is more than flavor; it rounds off dairy tones. Salt not optional; it lifts the flavors. Peppermint candies prefer crushed, uneven bits—larger chunks give textural interest, tiny dust causes bitter spots. Alternatives: Andes mints for softer melt away taste, chopped dark chocolate for richness. Keep candy dry to prevent melting. Store-bought or homemade candy both fine but freshness affects aroma punch. Metal loaf pan chills faster than glass, thinner walls speed freezing and firm edges, making scoopability easier. Aluminum foil traps aromas better than plastic; prevents drying out and ice crystal formation."
instructionsNote: "First, chill your pan minimum one hour; metal is key for quick temp drop that sets ice cream edges first—helps reach creamy center faster. Whisk heavy cream cold, watch for stiff peaks: stiff means you can hold the bowl upside down, not a little droop but sharp peaks. Folding means gentle turning under the mixture using a spatula to keep trapped air bubbles intact—this is magic texture-making. Pour mixture into very cold pan; prevents premature melting. Two-stage freezing: first to set, then add peppermint for fresh crunch. Stir in candies carefully not to lose fluff. Cover with foil tightly to avoid moisture loss leading to freezer burn and ice spikes. Freeze long enough for firm scoop; test texture by touch, not just timer. Serving tip: let soften briefly for better scooping without melting fast. Common mistakes: over beating cream leads to butter; under beating yields runny texture. Folding too vigorously deflates mixture turning ice cream dense and icy."
tips:
- "Chill metal loaf pan at least 55 minutes before use. Metal drops temp fast, sets edges first, helps creamy center form. Glass pans work but expect longer freeze times and softer texture. Foil cover traps moisture better than plastic wrap; prevents ice spikes and freezer burn. I always let the foil sit tight without air gaps. Sharp freezing cues handful—edges firm, center yielding, not solid."
- "Whip heavy cream cold with either a stand mixer or chilled bowl. Stiff peaks mean the bowl can go upside down without cream sliding. Over-whipping leads to butter; under-whipping creates runny texture. Whip time 2 to 2.5 minutes typical with cold cream. Watch for firm, distinct peaks. On humid days chill beaters too. I found folding gently preserves volume; aggressive folding kills air pockets."
- "Folding technique is key for fluffy mouthfeel. Use spatula, scoop under and lift mixture gently. Avoid swirling or mixing hard - deflates aeration. Fold one cup cream into condensed milk blend first; then fold in remainder. Air bubbles keep ice cream light and reduce iciness. Messed it up once: dense, icy chunk that stuck hard to pan. Patience—fold slow and steady."
- "Peppermint candies added after partial freeze at roughly 2 hours, once edges firm but center soft. Candy bits stay crunchy, don’t soften or dissolve if added too early. Crushed bits work best: uneven size adds textural interest. Andes mints softer, melt faster; chocolate chunks add richness. Never use liquid peppermint extract - freezes oddly, bitterness creeps in."
- "Serve right from freezer, let sit 5 minutes before scooping for easy portioning without melting fast. Foil helps trap aromas better than plastic. No electric mixer? Whisk by hand but takes longer, watch cream peaks carefully. If no metal pan, expect longer freeze and softer texture but still tasty. Common mistakes: over-whip cream, fold aggressively, candy too early. Adjust freezing times to pan type and kitchen temp."
faq:
- "q: How to know when cream is whipped enough? a: Look for stiff, sharp peaks. If you tip bowl upside down cream stays put. Avoid over-whipping; turn to butter. Underwhip and it’s loose, no volume. Watch timing—cold cream whips faster. Humidity affects too. Chill tools if needed."
- "q: Can I substitute peppermint candies? a: Sure. Andes mints softer, melt faster. Crushed candy canes work for crunch, but watch timing—too soon melts flavor. Chopped dark chocolate adds richness, flavor depth. Keep candies dry so don’t get soggy. No liquid extracts; taste weird frozen."
- "q: What causes icy texture? a: Usually overmixing deflates air, water crystals grow. Not folding gently enough. Freeze time too short or container not cold. Metal pan key to speed freezing and firm edges. Avoid ultra-pasteurized cream; won’t whip well. Sometimes patience fix—long freeze, let soften slightly."
- "q: Best storage tips? a: Keep tightly covered with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Foil locks moisture, aroma better than plastic wrap. Store in coldest part of freezer; avoid door. Leftovers freeze well but texture may soften over days. Quick thaw 5 minutes before serving helps scoop without melting fast."
