ingredients:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "150 g all-purpose flour"
- "25 ml powdered sugar"
- "5 ml baking powder"
- "1 ml fine sea salt"
- "140 g cold unsalted butter, diced"
- "60 ml crème fraîche (substitute yogurt)"
- "20 ml ice-cold water"
- "=== Filling ==="
- "350 g hulled strawberries, sliced"
- "120 g granulated sugar"
- "25 ml arrowroot powder (instead of cornstarch)"
- "5 ml freshly squeezed lemon juice"
- "1 tsp lemon zest"
- "=== Topping ==="
- "8 fresh strawberries, thinly sliced"
- "30 g crushed violet meringue cookies (store-bought or homemade)"
instructions:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "1. Pulse flour, powdered sugar, baking powder, and salt in food processor. Add butter cubes. Pulse until mixture resembles coarse peas. Key here is cold butter chunks—not fully mixed—tiny lumps add flakiness."
- "2. Stir in crème fraîche and 20 ml ice water. Add more water by teaspoon if dough feels dry—but don't overwork. Pull dough out, press into a flattened log."
- "3. Cut into 8 equal portions. Flour surface lightly, roll each into discs about 12 cm diameter and 3 mm thick (a bit thinner than usual for a tender bite)."
- "4. Fit dough into greased tartlet pans with removable bottoms (about 9-10 cm). Press edges gently, no stretching allowed or crust will shrink. Chill for at least 25 minutes to prevent shrinkage during baking. This waiting is crucial. No skipping."
- "=== Filling ==="
- "5. Preheat oven to 195°C (385°F). Place rack in middle."
- "6. In a bowl, toss strawberries with sugar, arrowroot, lemon juice, and zest. Arrowroot gives better shine and clarity, plus slight glossy texture—different from dull starch."
- "7. Spoon fruit with all juice evenly into crusts, spreading so no lumps or crowding. Overflowing will be messy."
- "8. Bake about 30-35 minutes. Listen for gentle bubbling from the filling and watch crust edges turn golden brown with slight crisp. Darker than blond but not burned—they crisp up further out of oven."
- "9. Remove, let cool 20 min. Filling to thicken and settle; tartlets still warm but not hot is right."
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "10. Just before serving, arrange sliced strawberries on top, scatter crushed meringues. The meringue curls and softens slightly but keeps crunch contrast."
- "11. Serve immediately or within an hour for vibrant textures. Don’t refrigerate long—crust gets soggy, meringue melts."
- "12. Leftover tartlets? Warm briefly in low oven for crispness."
introduction: "Strawberries and meringue. Flaky crust that snaps, fruit filling that’s both luscious and sharp, and those shattering meringue bits on top. I’ve tried every starch from cornstarch to potato, but arrowroot shines here. It keeps juices clear, thick, with a slight spring. A tangy lemon twist makes all the difference, often overlooked. That crust? I used to skimp on chilling the dough. Big mistake. Shrinking, tough edges, all because I rushed. Crème fraîche swaps for yogurt this time—more fat, more flavor, less risk of soggy bottom. No fluffing around, just clean ingredients, solid technique. Tarts that sing. And yes, meringue cracks under the teeth releasing faint violet aroma. A little chaos on every bite."
ingredientsNote: "Flour must be properly measured; too much and the crust toughens. Powdered sugar adds subtle sweetness without grittiness; don’t swap with regular sugar. Crème fraîche adds richness and tender crumb; if unavailable, use full-fat Greek yogurt but expect slight tang. Butter absolutely cold, diced generously for texture. Ice water added sparingly to bind dough without dissolving butter chunks. Arrowroot powder chosen over corn starch or flour to maintain glossy, translucent filling with less chew. Lemon zest and juice brighten up strawberry's natural sweetness and deepen flavors. Meringue pieces crushed are a textural game changer—home-made or store-bought, violet flavor is nice but pure vanilla or almond also work well."
instructionsNote: "Handling dough gently is key. Overworking means dense crust, no flakiness. Chilling dough until firm gives it bite and holds shape during baking. Roll discs thinner than your usual to complement light filling without overwhelming. Preheat oven fully; baking at 195°C ensures crust browns without burning while filling thickens properly. Watch for bubbling edges as a doneness marker; bubbles mean juices are cooked and starting to thicken. Remove tarts from heat but cool briefly before topping, or melted meringue disappoints texturally. Add fresh strawberry slices last, for zing and freshness. Serve within an hour to maintain crispness of crust and crunch of meringue; refrigeration kills both. Crust can be nuked in a warm oven if day-old, but never soggy recent leftovers."
tips:
- "Chill dough thoroughly before shaping. Cold butter chunks create flakes, warm butter means dense crust. Roll slightly thinner than usual; helps balance tender filling without bulk. Watch dough texture closely—too sticky means add a touch ice water. Overkneading kills flake, so pulse or stir lightly. Dough resting 25 minutes minimum avoids shrinkage later. Grease pans well; removable bottoms ease release. Temperature right crucial; hot oven browns crust but don’t let sugar burn inside filling."
- "Arrowroot powder is key; it gives shine and thickens without gumminess. Substitute with cornstarch if needed, but arrowroot holds color better and thickens at lower temps. Mix sugar and arrowroot dry before tossing with fruit to avoid clumps. Lemon zest and juice brighten flavor—leave out zest and filling dulls. Stir gently, avoid smashing berries; preserve texture. Filling bubbling gently signals done. Overbaking dries fruit, underbaking stays runny. Watch crust edges, golden with slight crisp."
- "Meringue topping can be crushed store-bought cookies or homemade violet-flavored meringue. Freshness matters—crumbly but still holds crisp. Add meringue only after tarts cool slightly; melting ruins contrast. Meringue aroma hint from violet scent is subtle but noticeable in final bite. Use vanilla or almond meringue also if violet not on hand. Slicing additional strawberries for garnish gives zing and freshness; add last to avoid moisture softening crust immediately. Serve quickly after topping for best texture snaps."
- "Butter temperature is a practical issue. I dice cold, then pulse fast to avoid warming. If dough looks too crumbly when adding crème fraîche and water, add liquid teaspoon by teaspoon. Dough is forgiving but don’t overwork or risk dense bite. Dough chilling can’t be skipped—had to redo batches after skipping that. Roll discs on flour-dusted surface; light flour, otherwise crust toughens. Bake on middle rack for even heat distribution; racks too high or low cause uneven browning or soggy bottoms."
- "If leftovers, warm gently at low oven temp to regain crisp without remelting meringue. Refrigeration kills crunch fast; meringue melts and crust soggy. Reheat only shortly. Dough freezing possible before shaping: wrap tightly to prevent freezer burn, thaw in fridge overnight. Assemble fillings fresh after thaw. Watch filling bubbling cues again for doneness after reheating. Don’t overbake reheated tartlets; leftovers meant for immediate enjoyment or quick warm-up only."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid crust shrinking? a: Chill dough well before baking. Press edges gently, don’t stretch dough in pans. Cold dough keeps shape. Avoid overly hot oven start; allows gluten to relax. Also, flour surface lightly when rolling. Rest at least 25 min in fridge."
- "q: Can I substitute arrowroot powder? a: Cornstarch works but less glossy finish. Potato starch thickens too but changes texture. Arrowroot preferred for clarity and shine. Adjust quantities—less powder for cornstarch. Always mix with sugar before fruit for even coating."
- "q: Meringue topping soggy after baking? a: Add meringue only after cooling tart. Heat melts meringue. Cool 20 min minimum at room temp before topping. Store away from fridge to keep crunch. For longer hold, make meringue thicker or bake cookies separately then crush."
- "q: Best way to store leftover tartlets? a: Avoid fridge if possible; crust gets soggy. Store loosely covered at room temp up to an hour. For longer, remove meringue, refrigerate base separately. Warm briefly in low oven before serving. Freeze crust dough before baking, not whole tart. Don't combine storage methods carelessly; textures break down fast."
