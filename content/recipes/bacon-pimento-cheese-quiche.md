slug: "bacon-pimento-cheese-quiche"
description: "A savory quiche mixing smoky crisp bacon with creamy cheddar and a handful of tangy diced roasted red peppers. Eggs and heavy cream swirl for richness while a buttery crust holds it all. Adjust baking time slightly based on crust thickness or oven quirks. Melted cheese forms a golden base, scattered pimentos peek through, bacon crumbles on top. A modest salt and pepper balance with subtle notes from cream. Visual doneness is key; gently jiggle tells you if it’s set. Serve warm, crust flaky, filling custardy yet firm. Classic flavors with a twist of roasted red pepper replacing traditional pimentos. Cheese swapped to sharp aged gouda for deeper complexity."

ingredients:
- "1 unbaked 9-inch pie crust, homemade or store-bought"
- "1 1/2 cups shredded sharp aged gouda cheese"
- "1/3 cup diced roasted red pepper, well drained"
- "6 slices smoky bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled"
- "4 large eggs"
- "1 cup whole milk"
- "1/3 cup heavy cream"
- "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "==="
- "Preheat oven to 380°F; place a large rimmed baking sheet on middle rack to heat. This hot pan jump-starts crisp crust bottom. Skip pre-baking crust if store-bought to avoid sogginess."
- "Place pie crust into tart pan or pie dish; press down crumbs if homemade. Sprinkle gouda evenly into crust base. Scatter roasted red peppers over cheese, ensuring no wetting so cheese melts perfectly. Top with crumbled bacon in patches, don’t overcrowd; bacon fat renders, enriches custard."
- "In a medium bowl whisk together eggs, milk, cream, salt, and pepper briskly enough to combine but not frothy. Pour gently into crust — careful not to spill or overfill. Filling should sit just below crust rim for safe expansion avoidance."
- "Transfer quiche to preheated baking sheet, sliding carefully to avoid shaking contents. Bake 40-45 minutes until center jiggles softly but cracks or raw spots vanish. Edges pull slightly from crust sides; top browns golden with occasional cheese bubbling through."
- "Remove from oven; place on cooling rack or counter. Wait 15-20 minutes to firm up further — crucial step or cutting causes runny mess. Slice warm; filling creamy, not wet. Remainder reheats well if wrapped, crust stays flaky with quick oven refresh."

introduction: "Imagine the crackle of bacon hitting hot pan, smell that hits your nose right before the sharp cheddar hits melting point. Then roasted red peppers instead of the usual pimentos—adds depth, a smokier, earthier note. I took the classic south favorite, swapped a few things to sneak in little changes that pack flavor. Gouda over cheddar? Bold move. Cream ties it all up, makes every bite glossy and rich. Baking sheet heats in the oven, smart shortcut to stop soggy crusts, learned that the hard way with soggy bottoms ruining a perfect quiche morning. And the jiggle test? It’s not just theory, trust it more than any timer. Warm slices, a flaky crust that snap-crackles when cut—that’s real joy."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping cheddar for aged gouda gives a nuttier, less sharp punch while maintaining meltability; try it if you want a twist. Roasted red pepper is a worthy substitute for pimentos: less briny, more natural sweetness with a bit of texture; drain meticulously or the custard will water down. Bacon choice matters—thick sliced renders fat slowly, crisp edges add that crunch contrast against creamy custard. Use whole milk and cream combo not just cream alone; too rich could make it heavy, too little leads to rubbery eggs. Salt needs care; pancetta or cured bacon adds saltiness so judge accordingly. If pressed for time, a store crust is fine, but pat dough dry if viscous filling seeps. Watch oven space, don’t crowd or heat drops. Lastly, lightly press down ingredients layer to stabilize before pouring custard, stops floating on one side."
instructionsNote: "Preheating a baking sheet is critical—heat retention directly helps crust bottom crisp, otherwise bottom stays limp from gradual heat transfer. Layer cheese first so it melts downward, locks in moisture. Red peppers should be fully drained or pat dry; excess liquid spoils texture. Bacon on top? Renders fat that infuses custard, but too much or clumped leads to uneven cooking – distribute in bits. Whisk eggs gently to prevent foam—too aerated = spongy rather than creamy texture. Pour slow, almost from height for even spread, but avoid overfill past crust rim to prevent spills baking. Bake until just-set with subtle wobble visible in middle; overbaking means dry custard. Let rest on wire rack post-oven; cutting too soon floods quiche and hides the layers. Reheat best in oven not microwave; retains flakiness and texture. Experienced cooks can halve or triple times, adjusting jiggle and color cues, not clocks."
tips:
- "Preheat a rimmed sheet pan inside the oven. Heating the pan traps heat under the crust. Crust bottom crisps fast. No pan means soggy waiting. Skip pre-baking if crust bought. Store crust sogginess kills texture. Thick bacon slices best for slow fat rendering. Crispy edges contrast creamy filling. Scatter bacon in bits, avoid clumps. Bacon fat seeps into custard layers. Don’t overcrowd toppings or quarrel with uneven cooking."
- "Drain roasted red peppers meticulously. Excess moisture ruins custard set and adds soggy spots. Pat dry or use paper towel squish. Cheese layer below keeps moisture trapped. Sharp aged gouda melts thicker, nuts instead of cheddar’s sharp bite. Gouda layer locks up custard moisture. Whisk eggs with milk and cream gentle. Over-aerate, custard goes spongy. Pour slowly, avoid overfill; spillover burns, disaster on oven floor."
- "Jiggle test beats timer every time. Center must wobble softly but no raw cracks. Too firm means dry custard. Pull edges slightly from crust varying crust thickness. If quiche puffs too much, gently press surface post bake – calms layers, evens texture. Rest quiche 15-20 mins minimum before slicing. Slicing hot = runny mess, hide all layers in flood. Reheat wrapped in oven, heat quick; micro ruins flaky crust and texture."
- "Swap whole milk and cream combo, not just cream. Too rich makes rubbery egg. Too little, custard lacks silkiness. Cured bacon or pancetta? Adjust salt carefully. Salt balance delicate here. Store crust fine when rushed but check dough texture, pat dry if filling too loose. Fill one side heavier? Press down toppings lightly, stops floating. Oven crowding drops heat, cook unevenly. Watch rack levels to match quiche size and don’t open too much once baking starts."
- "If bottom soggy? Broil 1-2 minutes carefully, watch close. Helps crisp last minute without drying top. Cold eggs or dairy? No go. Blend room temp for blend and avoid curdle or separation. Leftover bacon or red peppers? Freeze individual cubes, drain before reuse. Dairy-free? Use full-fat coconut milk instead but expect flavor shift. Replace bacon with smoked paprika when no pork option; keeps smokiness in custard."
faq:
- "q: How to tell if quiche is done? a: Jiggle center gently. Wobble means set enough. No cracks or raw spots. Edges pulling from crust sides hints readiness too. Avoid timers alone. Visual cues beat all. Brown top occasionally bubbles cheese. Stir once baked? No."
- "q: Can I use store-bought crust? a: Yes, but skip pre-baking. Store crust soggy risk if pan cold. Pat dry filling if loose or too wet. Fill just below rim. Avoid spills with slow pour. Press toppings layer down before pouring custard to stop floating. Oven space matters; no crowding."
- "q: What if quiche gets soggy bottom? a: Broil last 1-2 minutes max, watch closely. Hot pan preheat helps crisp bottom from start. Don’t skip this step if crust thick or filling moist. Drain red peppers well. Bacon fat aids crust texture but too much liquid equals sogginess."
- "q: How to store and reheat leftovers? a: Wrap chilled slices tightly. Reheat in oven short burst preserves flakiness; microwave kills texture and crust crispness. Freeze leftover bacon and red pepper cubes separately, drain thawed cubes well. Avoid cold ingredients in custard mix next bake, room temp blends better without separation."
