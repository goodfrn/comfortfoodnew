ingredients:
- "=== Soup ==="
- "3 large onions, thin sliced"
- "40 g (3 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "330 ml (1 can) pale ale beer"
- "1 litre (4 1/4 cups) beef broth"
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "400 g (14 oz) beef sirloin or skirt steak"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) unsalted butter"
- "4 eggs"
- "8 thin slices of baguette, toasted"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) chopped flat-leaf parsley"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "Twist: 1 tsp smoked paprika added to onions"
- "Twist: replace parsley with fresh thyme leaves"
instructions:
- "=== Prepare the soup base ==="
- "In a heavy pot over medium heat, heat 25 g butter. Add sliced onions. Soften 8 to 12 minutes stirring often."
- "Turn heat to medium-high. Sprinkle smoked paprika over onions. Stir and let onions brown deeper, stirring every 2 minutes, total 8 minutes or until golden and caramelized."
- "Pour in pale ale beer. Scrape the bottom to bring up browned bits. Boil until beer reduces by half, about 8 minutes."
- "Add beef broth. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer uncovered 20 minutes. Soup should reduce roughly by half and thicken slightly. Season with salt and pepper."
- "=== Cook beef and eggs ==="
- "Pat steak dry, season with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, melt 15 g butter over medium-high heat."
- "Sear steak 3 minutes each side for medium rare (adjust 2-4 minutes per side as needed). Remove steak and rest on plate. Wipe skillet clean with paper towel."
- "Melt remaining butter in skillet over medium-low. Crack eggs in gently. Cook eggs sunny side up about 6 minutes, whites set but yolks runny."
- "If wanted, use 7 cm round cutter to cut eggs neat."
- "=== Assemble ==="
- "Slice steak thinly across the grain."
- "Pour soup into bowls to cover bottom well."
- "Place two toasted baguette slices on top of soup in each bowl."
- "Add sliced steak over the bread."
- "Top each with an egg."
- "Sprinkle fresh thyme leaves (or parsley) over everything."
- "Serve immediately with extra bread if desired."
introduction: "Onions going golden over butter, thickening and sweetening. Beer poured in, bubbling and shrinking down. Broth follows, rich and dark, simmering into something deep. Steak sliced thin then browned, fat melting and sizzles.a bit crisp here, tender there. Eggs cracked gently, cooked low and slow till whites firm but yolks still soft, those orange pools. Toasted bread, crunchy, holding the meat and egg like a platform. Fresh herbs chopped, scattered over top, a little bright punch against the caramelized sweetness. Everything layered in bowls, hot steam spiraling up. More than soup, less than a full meal, but enough to satisfy. Foods that mingle yet stand out; textures and tastes popping against each other, warm and filling. Takes just over an hour, hands-on but manageable. No nuts or dairy complicate, just pure simple goodness, inviting and rustic."
ingredientsNote: "Butter amount reduced slightly to lessen richness but still enough to caramelize well. Onions fewer but thicker slices to preserve texture. Beef quantity trimmed by 30%. Pale ale substituted for original beer to provide mild bitterness and fruity notes. Parsley swapped for fresh thyme to add a tender herbaceous edge instead of more grassy parsley. Smoked paprika added for subtle smoky undertone that lifts the onions without overwhelming. The broth amount decreased to concentrate flavor faster while keeping liquid to support the bread soaking. Eggs large and fresh, handled gently for clean presentation and smooth whites. Toasted baguette thinly sliced to crisp but still chewy, perfect base to hold meat and egg with broth soaking edges. Salt and pepper to balance and accentuate flavors, used judiciously so each component shines."
instructionsNote: "Caramelizing onions requires patience; start slow on medium to soften without browning too quickly, then up heat to medium-high for deeper color. Stir regularly but leave longer intervals between to develop crusty bits. Smoked paprika sifted as onions deepen; enhances aroma, watch not to burn powder. Beer deglaze step crucial to pull flavor from pan. Let boil vigorously to evaporate bitterness and concentrate malt. Beef seared at high heat, quickly browning, rests to preserve juices. Wiping pan before eggs keeps clear flavor; butter melted on low heat lets whites set gently; avoid flipping eggs to keep yolks runny. Round cutter optional but for neat plating. Bowl assembly last step; layering from soup up to egg so textures contrast—soft broth, crunchy bread, tender meat, silky egg. Sprinkle herbs last, fresh and bright. Serve while hot. Timing staggered: onions start, then beef cooks as soup simmers; eggs last."
tips:
- "Start onions on medium heat with butter. Patience key. Softening first, watch not burn. Then crank to medium-high for caramelizing deeper color. Stir sometimes but let crust form - don’t stir too often. Smoked paprika goes in once soft, dust lightly. Burn paprika powder = bitter taste. Stir carefully after adding. Keep heat steady."
- "When beer hits pan, scrape browned bits well. Those brown bits hold flavor. Let beer boil till half evaporated. Reduces bitterness, concentrates malt notes. Simmer broth next, uncovered. Reduces further, thickens. Adds depth. Don’t cover or liquid won’t reduce properly. Salt and pepper added late, after reduction so seasoning balanced."
- "Steak dry before seasoning. Moisture kills sear. Medium-high heat, butter melts, sizzle fast. 3 mins each side for medium rare - adjust thickness. Rest steak after. Very important. Rest lets juices redistribute, keep tender. Wipe pan before eggs - leftover bits can burn eggs or cause uneven cooking. Butter on low for eggs, whites set slow. No flipping, yolk runs."
- "Eggs cracked gently into melted butter over low heat. Cooking time about 6 minutes for whites set, yolks still runny. Round cutter optional step to achieve neat plating shape. Egg yolks should remain intact, bright orange pools. Cooling too fast ruins texture. Keep gentle heat, care for smooth surfaces. Presentation matters if needed, but texture first."
- "Final assembly layered: soup base first, soup covers bowl bottom well. Toasted baguette rests on top – soak edges but stay crisp center. Thin sliced steak over bread. Egg on top. Sprinkle fresh thyme for herbaceous lift. Parsley can swap in for different aroma. Serve immediately. Bread can get soggy fast if sitting too long. Timing staggered: onions start, while soup simmers steak cooks, eggs last."
faq:
- "q: Can I use a different type of beer? a: Pale ale is milder, fruity. Darker beers work but change flavors. Stouts or porters add roast notes. Might overpower onion sweetness. Light beer balances better. Try mild lagers too. Avoid overly bitter or hoppy beers, can clash."
- "q: What if I don’t have skirt steak? a: Sirloin or flank good alternatives. Seared similarly. Adjust cook time for thickness. Tenderloin if you want softer cut but pricier. Even ribeye works but more fat. Tough cuts need longer cook times, not ideal here. Quick sear is key, keep medium rare."
- "q: How to handle overcooked eggs? a: Start over on heat control first. Low and slow for sunny side up. If white too runny, cook longer low heat, hold pan covered briefly. Avoid flips or high heat. Can poach separately then add but texture changes. Presenting intact yolks needs patience. Practice timing helps."
- "q: What’s best way to store leftovers? a: Soup you can refrigerate couple days in airtight container. Reheat on stove; add water if thickened too much. Steak slices tougher reheated; slice thin helps. Eggs best fresh; leftover eggs become rubbery. Bread stored separately to keep crisp. If making ahead, keep components separate till serving."
