title: "Rustic Spanish Tortilla"
slug: "rustic-spanish-tortilla"
description: "Classic Spanish potato omelet with a twist. Potatoes and onions fried gently until tender, not crisp. Eggs poured over, cooked on stovetop until edges firm, finished in oven for a soft center. Uses grapeseed oil instead of olive oil for higher smoke point and a hint of nuttiness, plus a touch of smoked paprika added for warmth. Timing based on visual cues—listen for soft sizzle, watch eggs set at edges but jiggle in center. Resting at room temp lets flavors marry, texture becomes creamy and slices clean."

ingredients:
- "4 cups peeled and thinly sliced Yukon potatoes"
- "1 large yellow onion thinly sliced"
- "5 large eggs lightly beaten"
- "2 tablespoons grapeseed oil or mild olive oil"
- "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "Salt to taste"
- "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"
- "Fresh parsley minced for garnish"
- "1/4 cup finely grated manchego cheese"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 335 degrees Fahrenheit. Easy to overshoot oven temperature so watch when baking."
- "Heat 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil in a 10-inch cast iron or heavy ovenproof skillet over medium heat until shimmer, tiny ripples appear."
- "Add potatoes and onions in batches if necessary. Shallow fry gently, stir often so nothing browns. Must get soft and translucent, slight giving when poked with a fork. No color on potatoes, they will toughen if crispy."
- "Remove potatoes and onions with slotted spoon to bowl. Save one tablespoon oil, discard rest—wipe the pan with paper towel, then rub in remaining oil on bottom and sides to stop sticking."
- "Fill skillet back with potatoes and onions, layering them evenly but loosely."
- "Sprinkle smoked paprika evenly over potatoes, adds earthiness without harsh heat."
- "Pour gently beaten eggs over potatoes, just enough to almost cover the mixture. You want eggs to peek up around edges but not drown potatoes."
- "Turn on burner to medium-low heat. Watch edges carefully. You’ll see them firm and start pulling away in 3 to 5 minutes. The center should still jiggle slightly when you shake the pan gently."
- "Slide the pan into preheated oven. Bake 10 to 18 minutes. Test doneness by giving pan a slight shake — no runny liquid should lap the edges. Center remains slightly moist but set. If too firm, becomes dry after resting."
- "Remove from oven. Rest tortilla at room temp a minimum of 1 hour or up to 2 hours before slicing. Resting allows flavors to develop, texture turns tender and sliceable."
- "Sprinkle with fresh parsley, sea salt flakes, cracked black pepper, and a dusting of grated manchego. Serve room temperature. Slightly nutty, smoky, soft with tender potatoes and gentle egg binding."
introduction: "Potato and onion getting soft but not browned is the soul of this dish. Frying slowly in mild oil prevents toughness later. Past mistakes? Using all olive oil made potatoes gritty and hard, a waste. Grapeseed oil handles heat better and doesn’t overpower with olive taste. Getting the egg amount right takes a bit of feel — too much and it’s soggy, too little and it falls apart. The edge set-stage is critical. Medium-low heat, gently watch for firm edges that pull back but center still jiggles slightly. Oven finishes from there, holding moisture inside. Resting is non-negotiable. Flavors mellow and texture firms but stays luscious. Manchego cheese on top brings a salty spark that lifts but doesn’t mask. Smoked paprika optional. But trust me, adds depth. A knife through this at room temp shows how well set it becomes, slices clean with soft yielding bite."
ingredientsNote: "Yukon gold potatoes best but any waxy spud works. Avoid starchy like russets—too floury. Onion adds sweetness but could swap shallots for subtler aroma if preferred. Eggs sized large, adjust quantity if potatoes heavier or lighter. Grapeseed oil higher smoke point than olive, keeps pan clean and potatoes tender. Butter also works, richer but watch color. Smoked paprika a personal addition: start low or skip if spice not wanted; it’s warmth not heat. Manchego grated fresh is salt and flavor boost, try parmesan if unavailable. Salt during frying keeps potatoes tender; no salt equals bland texture. If short on time, brief resting in fridge ok, but temp affects texture. Parsley fresh, rough chop, no wilt. Pepper freshly cracked unlocks aroma. Balance oil use in pan—too much greasy, too little sticks. Pan must be cast iron or heavy to hold temp steady."
instructionsNote: "Oven temp around 335-340 avoids overcooking edge or drying center. All pans differ; watch bubble action. Potato onions drawn translucent, soft when poked. Browning ruins texture, makes potatoes tough and dry. Layering gently keeps pockets for egg to settle. Pour eggs slowly, don’t flood potatoes or they’ll float. Medium-low heat key before oven. If too hot, edges burn before center cooks. Watch edge movement: set edges pull back slightly. Jiggle center shows still loose—bake more but avoid overbaking. Baking time flexible, test before removing. Rest at least an hour uncovered or lightly tented, allows steam to escape, prevents sogginess. Slice with sharp knife, clean cuts mean edges set. Manchego or cheese added last after resting; heat melts cheese too fast, losing texture contrast. Use slotted spoon when frying to drain properly. Too much oil pooling means cooling potato texture and soggy tortilla. Scrape oil excess after frying to avoid greasy final bite."
tips:
- "Potatoes must never brown. Slow shallow frying low heat. Watch closely. Soft, translucent, fork pokes slight give only. No crust. Browning toughens. Oil amount critical: not greasy but enough to avoid sticking. Grapeseed oil best here for heat. Butter richer but risk burn."
- "Layer potatoes and onions loosely. Packed tight stops egg settling. Eggs need room to coat, peek edges not drown. Pour slowly. Medium-low heat before oven. Watch edges firm and pull away. Jiggle center still moves. If no jiggle, overcooked and textures dry."
- "Use smoky paprika sparingly. Earthy warmth, no heat punch. Sprinkle evenly after potatoes layer. Swap if no access: mild smoked chili powder or omit. Manchego grated fresh after resting, melts slightly but still firm. Parmesan backup if needed adds salt but different texture."
- "Resting one hour room temp is non-negotiable. Flavors marry, texture firms but keeps soft bite. Cold fridge rest changes texture, gets dense and waxy. If short on time, tent loosely, but slices less clean. Knife needs sharp edge for clean cuts. Avoid wet or gummy slices."
- "Oven temp tricky. 335-340°F avoids dry edges, keeps center creamy. Cast iron or heavy pan needed to hold heat steady. Watch baking closely, test with pan jiggle for no runny egg. Baking time varies; trust movement, not clock. Slotted spoon drains potatoes well, excess oil removed prevents greasy final."
faq:
- "q: Can I use russet potatoes? a: No, russets too starchy, get floury and dry. Yukon gold or any waxy type ideal. Texture difference huge. Starch ruins softness and binding."
- "q: What if I skip smoked paprika? a: Flavor flattens a bit, less earthiness. Add mild smoked chili or paprika powder as alternative. Or just salt and pepper. Still tasty but missing that subtle warmth."
- "q: How prevent soggy tortilla? a: Drain potatoes well. Use slotted spoon after frying. Remove excess oil from pan before layering. Avoid flooding eggs over potatoes keeps moisture balanced. Overbaking dries inside, underbaking too wet. Resting also firms but not soggy if done right."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Can refrigerate 2-3 days wrapped well. Best eaten room temp or gently warmed. Avoid microwave for reheating, use low oven to preserve texture. Freeze not recommended; texture degrades, potatoes get mealy."
