ingredients:
- "12 oz large shrimp peeled deveined tail on"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning"
- "6 cups fresh baby spinach washed dried"
- "4 slices thick-cut bacon cooked crumbled reserving drippings"
- "1/3 cup red onion thinly sliced"
- "2 hard-boiled eggs sliced"
- "3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons granulated sugar"
- "1 tablespoon wildflower honey"
- "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard"
instructions:
- "=== For the shrimp ==="
- "Set grill on high, preheat heavy grill pan till it sizzles just to get that sear. Toss shrimp with Old Bay, coating every curve, shake off excess. Lay shrimp flat spaced, hear that snap of heat meeting moisture. Cook 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes per side depending on size. Watch closely – shrimp lose translucence, firm but springy is your goal. Overcooked? Rubber, flavor lost. Remove once opaque white with slight pink blush."
- "=== For the dressing ==="
- "In small bowl, whisk vinegar, sugar, honey, mustard until smooth. Use apple cider instead of plain vinegar for tang plus subtle fruitiness that blends with bacon fat. Keep drippings warm but not hot in saucepan over low heat – too hot breaks mixture. Slowly stream vinegar blend into fat while whisking steadily. You want a shiny, thickened emulsion, lightened color, coats spoon nicely. Keep over low warm heat to meld flavors, don’t rush. If dressing separates, heat low and whisk hard or add tiny drop warm water to bring back together."
- "=== For the salad ==="
- "Spread spinach on a big platter or bowl so each forkful includes greens. Scatter grilled shrimp over top, add crunchy crumbled bacon, red onion rings for punch and bite. Arrange egg slices last so they don’t break into yolk mess prematurely. Drizzle warm dressing evenly but gently. Toss carefully just before serving so spinach still crisp, dressing clings, no soggy leaves. Fork-test spinach texture often. If leaves wilt early, add dressing last minute or toss in smaller batches."
introduction: "Shrimp grilled with a kick – Old Bay’s sharp salty heat that every bite bursts with flavor. Spinach is more than just a bed, it’s the crisp green anchor, holding smoky bacon and sweet onion slices. Bacon drippings aren’t waste here, they anchor the dressing with warm fat that carries mild sharpness from mustard, sweetness from honey, and tang from cider vinegar. Watch the dressing emulsify slowly; you want a luscious silky coat, no fizzing or breaking. Hard eggs add creamy pockets. Timing shrimp is a dance; too long and they rubberize, too short and raw. Use touch and color over clock. Learned to grill shrimp fast, hot and watchful. Hands-on approach beats timers every time. Toss the salad gently – crushed spinach breaks fast. Good to slice eggs thick enough to hold shape but soft enough to mix into bites. Keeps it balanced, fresh, and full of layered textures. Bacon substitutes work too; pancetta renders a sweeter fat if you want more richness. Skip bacon? Use smoked salt in dressing for that flavor punch. Don’t dump hot dressing all over – drizzle and taste in waves. Salad changes fast once dressing hits leaves; eat soon."
ingredientsNote: "Shrimp sized around 12-15 per pound work best – large enough to grill without drying out quickly. Old Bay can be swapped for a mix of smoked paprika, celery salt, and cayenne if unavailable, but salt and heat levels vary so taste first. Bacon is essential for fat, but if dietary restrictions, try smoked turkey bits or rendered duck fat for different flavor notes. Apple cider vinegar adds fruity acidity; white wine vinegar is a fine substitute but less sweet, honey can be swapped with maple syrup for earthier sweetness. Red onion adds sharpness and crunch – if too strong slice thin and soak a minute in cold water to tame bite. Eggs? Use fresh, hard-cooked but not dry – timing about 9 minutes in simmering water. Store bacon drippings in jar for future dressings or roasting veggies; they freeze well. Spinach must be very dry; water kills dressing and makes leaves limp quickly; use a salad spinner or pat dry carefully. Use platter for serving so ingredients have room, salad overcrowded wilts."
instructionsNote: "Grill pan preheat is crucial – hot pan prevents sticking, encourages proper sear marks, locks in juices fast. Coat shrimp evenly, but don’t pile seasoning or it burns. Flip once when edges curl and base turns solid white. Avoid poking shrimp with fork; finger flick to test firmness. Too firm means overcooked, but slightly springy means done perfectly. Bacon drippings warm on low heat slowly, never boil – emulsions break if too hot or whisked too hard. Vinegar mix needs to be added slow to warm fat to give that silk texture. If separated, lower heat and whisk or add splash warm water to rescue. Warm dressing not hot; flicker of steam fine but don’t scald. Assemble salad quickly before dressing application; tossing too soon crushes spinach leaves. Add eggs last so their creamy texture offsets tangy dressing and crisp greens. Toss gently, fold with fork not spoon, preserve integrity of leaves and bite sizes. Let salad rest a couple minutes if you want flavors to meld but serve fresh before leaves wilt."
tips:
- "Grill shrimp on high heat; listen for snap and sizzle. Shrimp go from translucent pink to solid white with slight blush. Use finger press to check firmness - springy but not rubbery. Don’t overcrowd or steam. Shrimp size matters around 12-15 per pound avoids drying."
- "Warm bacon drippings on low slow; never boil or whisk breaks. Stream vinegar mix slowly while whisking steadily for stable emulsions. Dressing color shifts lighter, glossy sheen forms. If breaks, add splash warm water, keep whisk vigorous, low heat always. Use apple cider vinegar for fruity tang."
- "Spinach must be very dry – water ruins dressing cling. Use salad spinner or pat carefully. Large platter or bowl spreads leaves for easy tossing without bruising. Drizzle dressing gently, toss just before serving, not earlier or spinach wilts fast. Egg slices last to avoid runny yolk."
- "Old Bay seasoning coats shrimp curves evenly, shake off excess or burns happen. Swap with smoked paprika, celery salt, cayenne but taste first – salt heat vary. Bacon essential for fat base, try smoked turkey bits or rendered duck fat for flavor change. Timing seafood requires watchful eye, not clock."
- "Slice red onion thin, soak briefly in cold water if too strong, tames sharp bite but keeps crunch. Honey may be swapped with maple syrup for earthy sweetness variation. Store leftover bacon drippings for roasting or other dressings; they freeze well. Toss spinach gently; over mixing crushes leaves fast."
faq:
- "q: How to know shrimp done without clock? a: Watch color change white with blush pink. Press shrimp gently finger flick; springy means done. Too firm rubber. Timing varies with size and thickness. Listen for sizzle, smell sear aroma. Shrimp curl edges signal almost done."
- "q: What if dressing separates? a: Keep low heat, whisk hard slow. Add tiny warm water drop to bring back emulsion. Never boil dressing or whisk too fast. Vinegar-to-fat ratio key; streaming vinegar slowly makes coats shiny. Backup fix: make fresh batch if too broken."
- "q: Can I skip bacon? a: Yes but fat base needed or dressing fails. Use smoked turkey bits or rendered duck fat. Bacon drippings carry punch lost with lean oils. Smoked salt can replace bacon flavor – add carefully. Dressing texture changes with fat source; test in small batch."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Spinach salad best fresh; leaves wilt fast once dressed. Store shrimp and dressing separately in fridge up to 2 days. Bacon bits keep crisp if stored dry sealed. Warm dressing can be refrigerated and gently rewarmed low, whisk before use. Avoid soggy greens."
