ingredients:
- "1 medium onion, chopped finely"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "50 ml olive oil (about 3 tbsp)"
- "500 ml (2 cups) chopped fresh spinach, packed lightly"
- "250 ml (1 cup) shredded zucchini"
- "8 large eggs"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) crumbled feta cheese"
- "Fresh dill, chopped, 15 ml (1 tbsp)"
- "Salt and black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack to upper third position and preheat broiler to high."
- "Heat 20 ml olive oil in a 23 cm (9 inch) ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium heat."
- "Sauté onions and garlic until translucent and soft, about 5 minutes; remove to bowl and cool slightly."
- "In the same skillet, add remaining 30 ml olive oil then toss in spinach and zucchini. Cook stirring gently until wilted and soft, around 4 minutes; transfer to separate plate."
- "Beat eggs with feta and dill in the bowl with onion mixture; season with salt and pepper."
- "Return skillet to medium heat; pour egg mixture in, let settle without stirring for 45 seconds."
- "Distribute spinach and zucchini evenly over the eggs."
- "Cook gently for 6 to 7 minutes or until edges start browning and base is mostly set but center still slightly soft."
- "Place skillet under broiler for about 7 minutes until frittata is puffed, golden on top, and no longer jiggly."
- "Remove and allow to cool briefly before slicing."
- "Serve warm or at room temperature, with a drizzle of olive oil or fresh herbs if desired."
introduction: "Eggs meet greens, fats, and tangy cheese. No fuss but no shortcuts either. Onion and garlic soften first, the base flavor that lingers. Spinach and zucchini, not lettuce, this time, for a softer bite and added freshness. Whisked eggs tied with crumbled feta – the salty contrast. Dill brightens, adds that herbal punch that hints Mediterranean coastline. Quick cook on stove first, to get the edges golden, soft center waiting. Then just a few minutes under the broiler, crisping the top, creating that light crust that cracks when you slice through. Warm or room temp, this behaves well any way. Breakfast, lunch, even light dinner. No gluten, no lactose – easy swap for cheese, if needed, with a tangy vegan crumble. Summer or winter, this frittata keeps the kitchen simple and the plate loaded with good things."
ingredientsNote: "Onion and garlic provide the soft aroma base, nothing overpowering but necessary for depth. Olive oil splits into two parts: one to sweat aromatics, one for cooking greens and setting eggs gently without sticking. Spinach can be baby or regular leaf, chopped to manageable size. Zucchini shredded for texture and subtle moisture, not watery but enough to keep eggs tender. Feta cheese, salty and slightly creamy, replaces the usual parmesan, providing a different note. Dill chopped fresh, not dried, because it adds a crisp herbal freshness that parsley or basil can’t replicate. Salt and freshly ground pepper, adjusted at whisking stage and again at serving if needed. Skillet with nonstick surface helps avoid extra fats or sticking, a 9-inch size fits the volume perfectly – no crowding, even cooking. All parts measured but flexible. Swap veggies, cheese, herbs to your mood, but keep roughly same quantities for balance of moisture and flavor."
instructionsNote: "Start broiler and position rack early – the final step needs heat ready and steady. Using one skillet simplifies cleanup, minimizes transfers and temperature swings. Sauté onion and garlic with gentle attention till tender. Cool slightly to prevent cooking eggs prematurely on mixing. Greens need quick cooking, just to wilt and soften without losing vibrant color or turning mushy. Eggs beaten with feta and dill come after veggies to let flavors meld briefly before combining with hot pan. Pour eggs in, cook low-medium, avoid rapid stirring – delicate structure forms. Eggs should just begin setting at edges with a slightly wobbly center before greens go on top. The 6-7 minutes on stove preps frittata to hold shape. Broil finishes quickly, so watch closely – no more than 7 minutes to avoid dryness. Rest before cutting to avoid crumbling. Serve simply, or with a light salad or crusty bread. Variations emerge by swapping herbs or cheese, but timing and textures remain key points."
tips:
- "Chop onions finely. Avoid large chunks. They cook faster. Sauté till translucent. Garlic should be minced too. Don’t let it burn. Keep a close eye. Adjust heat as needed. Pay attention."
- "Adjust the feta cheese. Crumble it well. Helps distribute flavor throughout. Try mixing cheeses. Goat cheese can add tang. Or look for a vegan replacement. Keep ratios similar."
- "Zucchini adds moisture. Shred it. But not too coarse. Too much water makes frittata soggy. Squeeze out excess liquid. Use a clean cloth or paper towel. Prevent issues with texture."
- "Broiler is key. Watch the frittata closely. It can go from golden to burnt fast. Keep it about 6-7 minutes. Check it after 5 minutes. Adjust timing based on your broiler."
- "Herbs can change flavor. Dill is fresh and bright. Swap it with parsley for a different kick. Basil offers sweetness. Experiment, but adjust quantities to not overpower."
faq:
- "q: Can I use frozen spinach? a: Yes you can. Thaw and squeeze out moisture first. Frozen may have more water. Fresh options always great. But frozen works."
- "q: What's a good serving suggestion? a: Serve warm with a light salad. Or add toasted bread for texture. Pair with fresh herbs. Simple but effective."
- "q: Can I make this ahead? a: Absolutely. Frittata holds well in the fridge. Store in an airtight container. Reheat gently in microwave or oven."
- "q: How long does it last? a: Typically up to 3-4 days in fridge. Check for signs of spoilage though. Always trust your senses. Smell and look closely."
