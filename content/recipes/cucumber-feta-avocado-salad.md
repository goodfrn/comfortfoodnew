ingredients:
- "1 medium English cucumber"
- "1/3 red onion quarter, thinly sliced"
- "1/3 ripe avocado, diced"
- "1/3 lime, juiced"
- "40 g (1.5 oz) feta cheese, coarsely crumbled"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) chopped fresh dill"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) dried oregano"
- "green or red hot sauce, as preferred"
instructions:
- "Use a mandoline set to thin slices—about 2.5 mm or slightly thinner—over a wide-mouthed container. Slice cucumber into translucent ribbons, watch out: cucumber juice tends to slip and slide; avoid wasting it — keep it in the bowl."
- "Thinly slice red onion, no need for paper-thin, enough to feel the crunch balanced against creamy avocado later. Add to container along with diced avocado."
- "Squeeze lime juice evenly over avocado immediately to avoid browning. Toss in crumbled feta."
- "Pour olive oil and sprinkle dill and dried oregano on top. Watch that oregano; too much makes it bitter—start small — you can add after shaking."
- "Add hot sauce now or hold to the end, depending on heat tolerance."
- "Seal container tightly; safety first. Shake vigorously about 20 seconds or until you see everything coated, dressing emulsified, and the feta breaking slightly into the mixture. Sounds — liquid swishing, feta crumbling — tell you you nailed it."
- "Open and taste. If onion feels too raw, let it sit 3-5 minutes or repeat the shake. Quick acidity softens raw pungency."
- "Serve immediately. Leftover? Keep avocado covered tightly; texture degrades fast."
- "Variations: Swap feta for creamy goat cheese or firm halloumi chunks for more bite. Replace oregano with fresh mint for brightness, or add thin sliced radish for peppery contrast."
- "No mandoline? Use the sharpest knife you own and steady hands—slice paper-thin. Uneven slices? No big deal — texture variability adds charm."
- "If no hot sauce, add a pinch of cayenne pepper mixed into oil before shaking for heat."
- "Salt lightly before shaking only — cucumber and feta release moisture and salt too early can make the salad watery."
introduction: "Crunch. Quick. Bright. Cucumber sliced thin, that snap and little wetness you want in salads but never get just right. Then creamy avocado chunks—soft but holding their shape if you cut too thin they vanish. Feta crumbles add salty punch—never uniform, sometimes a big melt, sometimes a salty kiss. Onion sharp but tamed by acid and olive oil swirling it all crisp and smooth together. Shake—the oddest method turned genius. It coats everything evenly, breaks flavors gently without bruising good stuff. Learned early on not to skip the fresh dill—adds green perfume and freshness. Heat? Optional but really nails the back of the throat, wakes the palate. No fuss, no lengthy prep, just clean, vibrant layers you taste in every bite."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust lime juice to taste; more acid softens onion faster but can drown avocado’s subtle flavor. Avocado ripeness matters—too green? Firm bites but less cream. Overripe? Sloppy, turns mushy quickly. Substitute cucumber with Kirby pickling cucumbers for crunchier texture or English cucumber for milder flavor and thinner skin—no need to peel. Feta: buying block and crumbling yourself improves texture over pre-crumbled. Dill: fresh is non-negotiable; dried often tastes flat or dusty. Oregano lends earthiness, but too much overwhelms. Green hot sauce is more herbal, red is sweeter and smoky. Use spray oils sparingly—too much slicks and hides natural textures. Salt gently; remember chewsoup effect—salt pulls liquid, making salad watery if impatient. If allergic to dill, swap with flat-leaf parsley or basil for a different herbal note."
instructionsNote: "Every step about maximizing texture and balance. Thin cucumber slices soak up dressings faster but peel if skin tough or waxed—skip otherwise, natural bitterness holds it together. Shake part crucial—not just stirring—vigorous motion bruises feta slightly releasing salty tang into dressing. Smell changes signal readiness: fresh oil and lemon mingling with herbs means it’s well-coated. If onion overpowering, a quick soak in cold water before slicing tempers harshness. Don’t wait too long before serving—the avocado color fades and texture slips, losing creamy integrity. Keep salad cold if delaying; warm softens avocado, dilutes fresh bite. If shaking container is risky (leaks, splashes), transfer to a large bowl and toss energetically with spatula but longer needed to emulsify dressing evenly. Watch for watery buildup at the bottom, pour off or fold back quickly to keep crispness. Vibrant green flecks of dill and oregano contrast with white of feta and glossy avocado against pale cucumber—easy on the eyes as well as palate."
tips:
- "Mandoline slicer? Sharp knife works but steady hands required. Thin cucumber ribbons soak dressing fast, add texture contrast. Keep any cucumber juice gathered to avoid wasting flavor and moisture. Watch cutting thickness; too thick loses crispness, too thin and avocado chunks vanish. Balance crunch and softness—key for layered mouthfeel. Always slice cucumber over container to catch slips and drips—less mess, more flavor retained."
- "Add lime juice immediately after dicing avocado—stops browning, keeps color fresh but not overpowering. Toss feta quickly; crumbles release salt slowly. Olive oil coats herbs and cheese—start small on oregano to avoid bitterness, better add later if needed. Shake vigorously, not gently—wear on mixture enough to break feta’s structure slightly for dressing meld without turning everything mushy."
- "If lacking fresh dill, swap with flat leaf parsley or basil but flavor shifts noticeably. Oregano dried is earthy but should be measured carefully; bitterness develops fast. For heat, green hot sauce adds herbaceous punch, red makes it sweet-smoky. No mandoline, thin slicing onion avoids raw punch that can dominate. For onion too sharp, quick soak in cold water prior to slicing cuts bite without waterlogging."
- "Handling leftovers? Avocado degrades fast; cover tightly, keep cold but not frozen. Texture drops rapidly as it warms. If salad watery next day, pour any liquid off before serving. Salt only before shaking to prevent premature moisture release. If no hot sauce, cayenne in oil works well but mix thoroughly to avoid hot spots. In absence of feta, creamy goat cheese or halloumi chunks make distinct texture shift, more chew and salt variance."
- "Shake method often underused; vigorous motion needed to emulsify dressing fully and break feta—sound of swishing and feta crumbling tells readiness. Don’t just stir or toss. If container leaks risk, toss in big bowl with a spatula longer till dressing coats evenly. Watch for watery buildup at bottom; pour off or remix quickly to keep texture intact. Keep salad cold; warm softens avocado, dulls freshness, and damages texture quickly."
faq:
- "q: How thin to slice cucumber? a: Thin as possible. Mandoline best. Knife works slow. Aim ribbons 2 to 3 mm thick. Thicker loses crispness. Thin keeps crunch and absorbs dressing better."
- "q: Can I use other herbs than dill? a: Yes. Parsley or basil work but flavor shifts. Dried oregano is earthy but risky if too much. Fresh herbs preferable for brightness and aroma. Plays big role in mouthfeel."
- "q: What if avocado browns fast? a: Use lime juice immediately after dicing. Keeps color but watch acidity level to avoid overpowering. Refrigerate tightly covered. Best eaten within hours, fades fast otherwise."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cover tight, fridge only. Avoid warmth that makes avocado mushy. Some liquid will settle, pour off before serving. Avoid shaking much after sitting, changes texture. Eat promptly next day."
