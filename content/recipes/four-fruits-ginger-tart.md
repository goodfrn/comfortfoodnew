title: "Four Fruits Ginger Tart"
slug: "four-fruits-ginger-tart"
description: "Mixed berries with diced apples in a gingery crust. Changed fruit amounts by about 30 percent. Cassonade swapped with coconut sugar, cranberries replaced by black currants. Dough has more ginger, less butter. Steps shuffled and cooking time tweaked slightly. Preparation involves two dough discs chilled before rolling thin. Cooking at moderate heat til crust shines golden. Tart kept chilled 3-4 days. Fruity filling thickened with cornstarch and cooked to bubbling before cooling. Dough made crumbly then hydrated slowly. Egg wash for shiny crust, extra cut-out stars on top. Sweetness tweaks and fruity tartness balanced carefully."

- "18 g 2 ½ tbsp cornstarch"
- "200 g 1 ½ cups sliced frozen strawberries"
- "180 g 1 ½ cups frozen raspberries"
- "80 g ¾ cup frozen black currants"
- "2 medium Cortland apples peeled and cubed"
- "=== Ginger crust ==="
- "210 g 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour"
- "20 ml 1 ½ tbsp coconut sugar"
- "20 ml 1 ½ tbsp freshly grated ginger"
- "7 ml 1 ½ tsp ground ginger"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "130 g ½ cup unsalted butter cold cut in cubes"
- "45 ml 3 tbsp ice water"
- "1 egg"
- "20 ml 1 ½ tbsp milk"
- "Sugar for sprinkle optional"
instructions:
- "=== Prepare filling ==="
- "Off heat combine sugar with cornstarch. Coat fruits and apples. Heat on medium-high stirring until thick and bubbly. Transfer to bowl. Let cool, cover, refrigerate until use."
- "=== Make crust ==="
- "Mix flour, coconut sugar, grated and ground ginger, salt. Rub in butter with fingertips until pea-sized lumps remain. Slowly add ice water. Stir just enough to moisten dry bits; chunks of butter still visible. Shape dough into two discs. Wrap tightly with plastic. Chill 1 hour."
- "=== Assembly and baking ==="
- "Bottom oven rack placement. Preheat oven to 195°C (383°F)."
- "Lightly flour workspace. Roll discs thin (3 mm). Line 23 cm tart pan with one dough round. Spoon cooled filling in."
- "Cut stars from second disc to vent. Cover tart with star-studded dough layer. Trim excess dough. Fold edges under first dough, seal edges."
- "Beat egg with milk. Brush. Press extra cut stars on top. Brush again. Sprinkle sugar if liked."
- "Set tart on baking sheet. Bake 45 minutes or until crust golden. Cool on rack."
- "Store chilled 3-4 days."
introduction: "Berries and apples chopped, mixed. Sugar and starchy powder bring thickness. Rest in fridge till chilling. Dough’s ginger strong. Butter cold, bits peeking. Pretty big chunks. Cool water trickles in slow, just wet enough. Patted disks wrapped while rest. Oven low, thick heat underneath. Rolled paper-thin, eggs and milk shine crust. Stars cut for air, placed neatly. Sugary finish sparkles bright. Tarts bake golden, smell gingery, fruity. Cool down. Last several days in cold spot. Sweet, zesty, soft, firm. Fruit bursts meet flaky edges. Different fruits create layers. Black currants replace tart cranberries, deeper flavor. Coconut sugar shifts sweetness. Not too sweet, balanced sharp. Waiting pays back in bites. Crunch and softness, warm spice. Summer and fall collide. Serve chilled or room temp. Always gone quick, guards lift leftovers quick."
ingredientsNote: "Using coconut sugar softens caramel notes compared to traditional cassonade. Fresh ginger bump in dough amps spice beyond powder alone. Black currants swap cranberries but keep tart profile; not as sharp though. Fruit amounts trimmed by roughly 30%, less overwhelming, better balance of syrup. Apples diced smaller to marry better with soft berries. Flour is simple all-purpose, no bleaching, steady base. Butter cut cold keeps dough flaky, ice water chills dough without overworking. Egg and milk for smooth shine, easy glaze. Sprinkle sugar adds crunch, optional but tweak for desired crunch-sweet level. Frozen fruits handy, defrost or cook from frozen with adjusted heat for gentle thickening. Two dough disks make handling easier, less tearing. Rolls thin but sturdy. Wrap, chill solidifies butter again before baking. Keep portions even to avoid soggy bottom. Interchange sugar types and fruit seasonally; adjust balance accordingly."
instructionsNote: "Coat fruit mix with sugar and starch off heat first; stops lumps. Heat on moderate high, stir constantly so no sticking or burning. Mixture thickens but scales to jam-like, not overpower mush. Cool before filling crust to avoid sogginess. Dough mix done quickly—cold butter with flour stays best flaky. Add water dropwise, stop when dough just holds. Overmixed dough leads to toughness. Two disks simplified shaping; roll on floured surface. Thickness at about 3 mm; thinner dough rips, thicker cooked uneven. Leaf second disk whole but vented with multiple star holes to let steam escape. Seal edges well to keep juices inside. Egg wash ensures golden finish, extra stars add visual pop and texture. Bake on low rack prevents burning crust bottom but still gets crisp. Time slightly longer than original accounts for thinner dough and wetter fruit filling. Cool fully on rack, hot filling can be runny. Store in fridge, lets flavors meld and filling thicken more overnight. Serve cool or room temp, best within a few days to keep crust crisp."
tips:
- "Cold butter chunks must remain visible before adding ice water. Over mixing ruins flakiness. Add water dropwise until dough barely comes together. Wrap and chill twice if needed. Dough too soft = greasy crust, too dry = cracks."
- "Filling thickens best off heat, sugar coats fruits first. Stir constantly when heating or lumps form. Bubbly means cornstarch activated. Cool fully before filling crust or soggy bottom. Frozen fruits can release more water, adjust cornstarch accordingly."
- "Rolling dough thin at 3mm keeps balance of sturdy crust and crisp bite. Use plenty flour on surface, rotate dough often. Two disks better than one for handling, freeze excess if not baking all. Multiple star vents allow steam out, prevent soggy top."
- "Egg wash with milk creates shiny golden crust but brush lightly or pooling. Extra cut-out stars decorate but also vent air. Sprinkle sugar post-wash adds crunch and slight caramelization. Bake on low oven rack to avoid burnt bottom without underdone center."
- "Chilling tart post-bake firms filling, blends fruit flavors. Store cold 3-4 days max, crust loses crispness after that. Bring to room temp before serving or keep chilled for firmer texture. Balance sugar to fruit tartness; coconut sugar less sweet than cassonade."
faq:
- "q: Why freeze dough discs before rolling? a: Keeps butter chilled. Prevents melting during rolling. Better flaky layers. Easier to handle. Stops gluey dough. Crisper crust after bake."
- "q: Can fresh fruit replace frozen? a: Possible yes but adjust cooking time. Fresh produces more juice. More cornstarch needed for thickness. Cook gently to avoid mush. Frozen lowers water release, more stable filling."
- "q: How to avoid soggy bottom crust? a: Chill filling completely before adding. Roll dough thin but even. Bake on lowest rack. Use circle of parchment or blind bake crust slightly. Seal edges well to trap juices."
- "q: Best way to store leftover tart? a: Refrigerate wrapped or in container. Keeps filling firm longer. Not ideal room temp beyond few hours. Freeze possible but crust softens after thaw. Eat within 3-4 days for texture."
