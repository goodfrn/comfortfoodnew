ingredients:
- "2 onions, finely chopped"
- "2 courgettes, diced"
- "1 carrot, diced"
- "1 fennel bulb, diced (replacement for celery)"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) olive oil, plus more for finishing"
- "225 g (1/2 lb) boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) ground coriander"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) ground cinnamon"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) ground black pepper"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) ground turmeric"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) cayenne pepper"
- "1.5 liters (6 cups) chicken broth"
- "1 can 796 ml (28 oz) diced tomatoes"
- "1 can 540 ml (19 oz) chickpeas, rinsed and drained"
- "90 g (1/2 cup) fine bulgur"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) fresh coriander, chopped"
instructions:
- "Heat olive oil in large pot over medium-high. Toss in onions, courgettes, carrot, fennel. Stir often. Cooking smells sweet, veggies soften but still firm, 6-8 minutes. No browning yet, want gentle sweat."
- "Add chicken pieces, spread out for max contact. Sprinkle coriander, cinnamon, pepper, turmeric, cayenne over. Stir for 1-2 minutes until fragrant and chicken starts to lose pink but not cooked through. Beware overcooking here or chicken dries out, moisture important."
- "Pour chicken broth and tomatoes, juices loosen stuck bits on pot bottom. Increase heat, bring to lively boil - listen for a rolling bubble, not just steam. Lower to medium, allow to simmer. Notice stew thicken slightly, aromas deepen over 28-32 minutes. Vegetables collapse into tender, broth rich and spiced—not watery. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking."
- "Add rinsed chickpeas, fine bulgur. Bulgur swells fast and thickens soup; keep an eye. Simmer another 13-17 minutes. Soup thickening, bulgur tender without mushiness, chicken tender piece with bite. If soup too thick, splash water or broth. Season with salt, pepper last minute; salt early dulls veg sweetness."
- "Ladle into bowls. Scatter chopped coriander generously—green pop against reddish broth. Drizzle olive oil to finish, that bright fruity aroma over warm soup. Serve with sturdy flatbread for dunking or alongside brikas au thon and egg for something different."
introduction: "Forget plain soups. This bulgur-chicken broth punches way above its weight. From my early days, undercooked veggies meant limp texture; overcooked chicken, rubbery bites. So here’s the fix — keep onions, courgettes, carrot and fennel stirred gently in olive oil until they soften but don’t brown. Sweet aroma builds slowly. Chicken chunks get that quick spice robe before broth bath. Notice the simmering visual cues - bubbles rolling steadily, veg soft yet holding shape. Bulgur’s tricky if overdone; imparted that awaited chewiness without dissolving. Chickpeas bring needed bite, contrast. Aromatics? Coriander leaf at end signal bright, fresh finish—no wilting minutes passed. No celery this round, switched fennel for that mild licorice hint; unexpected tweak but works. Season close to serve, always. Oil drizzle at end? Don’t skip. Adds sensual richness and shine. Trusting senses over timer, learned this after many burnt stabs. This soup demands kitchen attention, not countdown obsession. Punchy, hearty, but balanced with fresh green crispness—calls for crusty bread or, if daring, brikas with tuna and egg for playful side."
ingredientsNote: "Vegetables kept diced evenly to encourage consistent cooking times—same principle applies with other veggies. Replacing celery with fennel adds subtle aromatic complexity without overpowering base notes. Olive oil chosen for its fruity profile; other neutral oils can dull flavor. Chicken thighs preferred over breasts for fat content and tenderness — breast often dries here. Ground spices best freshly bought; stale coriander or cinnamon blunts aroma, low heat releases oils slowly. Bulgur grain size key — ‘fine’ absorbs liquid without mush. Chickpeas canned for convenience; dry beans require soaking days ahead, a hassle. Broth strength varies: homemade or store-bought can shift saltiness—taste before salting. Fresh cilantro rough chopped at last; prolonged cooking turns it bitter. Substitutions? Use kale or spinach for leafy twist but add minutes. Got no fennel? celery is safe fallback. Dunk with rustic bread, or add dollop harissa for heat. Kitchen hack: prep veggies night before diced in cold water to crisp, drain well before cooking to avoid dilution. Balance moisture mindfully through cooking stages; cook stovetop lid off or on depending on evaporation desired."
instructionsNote: "Veg sauté not to color but to sweat out sweetness—stir every 2 mins so they soften evenly without burning. Chicken added cold to hot pan; quick toss to seal spices onto meat; don’t crowd pot—shove aside if tight, cook in batches. Spices toasted lightly boost flavors but watch for burn, cinnamon especially bitter if overheated. Incorporate liquids gradually to deglaze fond, stir to pick up those caramelized bits, essential for depth. Simmer gently; rapid boil breaks down veg and chicken fibers, turns broth cloudy and harsh. Observe veg texture with fingertip; should give glassy softness but not collapse entirely. Adding bulgur last is crucial; too early it swells and starves vegetable nutrients, alters texture. Chickpeas starchy, bulk base; add just before bulgur so chickpeas retain bite without sink to mush. Salt near end preserves vegetable brightness. Final garnish adds fresh contrast and mouthfeel. Oil drizzle; use best cold-pressed olive oil for scent. Timing is guidance; trust sight and texture—too soft? add quick boil. Too dry? splash more broth. Your pot, your rules. Keep tasting, adjusting flavors as soup mutates through cooking."
tips:
- "Veggies diced evenly—key. Uneven cuts cause uneven cooking; some mush, others stay raw. Watch texture by sight and touch not timer. Sweating onions, courgettes, carrot, fennel releases sweetness. No color yet, low heat key. Stir often but gently—burnt edges ruin base. Later, add chicken cold to hot pan for quick spice coat; crowding chills pan, cooks uneven. Use batches if needed. Spices toasted lightly first, cinnamon burns fast, smells bitter then. Manage heat."
- "Broth and tomato introduction deglazes pot—listen for simmer bubble not steam. Rolling boil sound signals right heat. Drop temp to medium for long gentle simmer. Broth thickens slowly; veggies collapse gently. Stir now and then to prevent sticking but avoid over-agitation that breaks pieces. Bulgur last addition; too early drains its texture and veggies weaken from prolonged cooking. Chickpeas before bulgur to keep their bite intact. Watch swelling closely."
- "Salt added near end preserves veggie brightness; salting early flattens sweet notes. Final coriander scatter straight off heat; prolonged cooking turns bright green bitter. Olive oil drizzle last step, use best quality cold pressed. Adds shine and aroma layer—don’t skip. If soup thickens too much, splash broth or water. Keep some extra broth handy. Taste frequently, adjust seasoning gradually. Trust your nose and eyes more than clock. Texture signals speak louder than minutes."
- "Substitutes handy: fennel swapped for celery here, adds subtle licorice note, more aromatic but mild. No fennel? celery safe fallback. Bulgur grain size matters; fine bulgur absorbs broth well without going mushy. Chunky bulgur ruins texture. Chicken thighs preferred for moistness. Breasts dry out easier here. Chickpeas canned for speed; dry beans need days soak or longer cook, not practical with bulgur timing. Chill leftovers stored fridge tight sealed, reheat gently."
- "Skip lid early too long? Soup evaporates fast, broth thickens beyond intention. Cover partially to control moisture. Smells deepen as stew thickens, bubbles drop from rapid to steady rolling. Look for that shift. Bulgur swells fast—after 10 minutes check bite, too soft or tough? Adjust heat or timing. If mushy, next batch less cook time, rinse bulgur beforehand to slow swelling. Vegetables soft but holding shape? Keep simmer strong but gentle. Stirring frequency affects veggie integrity, balance."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid mushy bulgur? a: Add bulgur late. Fine grain best, swells fast. Watch closely. If mushy, try rinsing first. Adjust simmer time; too long breaks it down. Heat control critical here."
- "q: Can chicken breast work? a: Breast dries quick. Use thighs if possible for moisture and flavor. If breast only, reduce cook time after spices. Cook gently, avoid crowding pan. Add extra broth to keep moist."
- "q: What if no fennel? a: Celery natural fallback. Different flavor, less aromatic but adds crunch. Kale or spinach can substitute but add after bulgur—greens need less cooking. Keep in mind flavor shift, softer taste."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container up to 3 days. Reheat gently on stove to avoid drying chicken. Can freeze but texture changes in bulgur; better fresh. Add fresh coriander at serving for brightness."
