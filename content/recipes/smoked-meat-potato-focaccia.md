slug: "smoked-meat-potato-focaccia"
description: "A hearty focaccia with thinly sliced small potatoes and smoky deli meat. The dough rises for two hours, becoming pillowy, while potatoes simmer in milk and garlic until tender but firm. Cheddar cheese and fresh herbs bring sharpness; the smoked meat added at the end preserves its rich flavor and texture. Baking until golden and bubbling, this focaccia layers textures and flavors for a satisfying rustic main. Adjust moisture and timing to avoid soggy spots; use Yukon gold in place of rattes; swap cheddar with gruyere or aged gouda for a twist."

ingredients:
- "=== Dough ==="
- "440 g (3 1/2 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) sugar"
- "15 ml (3 tsp) instant yeast"
- "8 ml (1 1/2 tsp) salt"
- "450 ml (1 7/8 cups) lukewarm water"
- "=== Topping ==="
- "750 g (5 cups) small yellow potatoes sliced lengthwise 4 mm"
- "450 ml (1 7/8 cups) whole milk"
- "3 large garlic cloves, minced"
- "175 g (1 3/4 cups) sharp gruyere cheese grated"
- "2 ml (1/3 tsp) fresh thyme leaves"
- "120 g (4 oz) smoked beef brisket thinly sliced"
- "Sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper"
instructions:
- "=== Dough ==="
- "1. Combine flour, sugar, yeast, salt in mixing bowl. Pour lukewarm water gradually; mix until shaggy dough forms. Knead 6 minutes using dough hook or by hand on floured board until dough smooth and elastic but slightly tacky. Test by gently pressing fingertip; should spring back slowly. Too sticky, flour sprinkle lightly; too tight, add splash water."
- "2. Shape dough into ball. Lightly oil large bowl and roll dough so all sides coated. Cover loosely with damp cloth; place in warm spot with slight humidity (like oven off with light on) for 90-120 minutes or until doubled in size and indent springs back slowly but remains visible. Overproof and dough sags, tough crust; underproof, dense base."
- "=== Topping preparation ==="
- "3. In large skillet, combine sliced potatoes, milk, minced garlic. Cover, bring to gentle simmer—listen for soft bubbling. Cook on low, stirring often to keep potatoes moving, about 20 minutes. Potatoes should be tender yet hold shape; no mush or firm crunch. Season sparingly with salt and pepper; potatoes absorb as they cool. Drain lightly using slotted spoon but retain some milk for moisture in pan. Avoid water draining which can dry topping."
- "4. Preheat oven to 210°C (410°F). Position rack mid-level. Line 35 x 28 cm (14 x 11 in) oven tray with parchment paper; grease lightly; let paper overlap edges for easy lift out."
- "=== Assembly and baking ==="
- "5. Punch down risen dough gently to deflate excess air. Transfer to tray. Spread dough evenly, pressing fingertips all over to create characteristic dimples. Dough should fill most of tray but maintain 1 cm border for rise. Scatter minced garlic evenly over dough surface."
- "6. Sprinkle grated gruyere cheese liberally ensuring coverage but not thick clumps. Arrange drained potatoes evenly in single layer atop cheese. Scatter fresh thyme leaves over potatoes. Salt and freshly ground pepper over surface; remember smoked meat salty already."
- "7. Bake 35 minutes or until crust deep golden and crisp; cheese melted and bubbling, edges just pulling from paper. Crust sound hollow when tapped on edges. Remove from oven."
- "8. Immediately scatter thin slices smoked brisket over hot focaccia—residual heat warms without drying or toughening delicate meat. Let rest 5 minutes before serving to settle flavors but still warm."
- "== Tips =="
- "Use Yukon gold potatoes if unavailable; add pinch nutmeg to potatoes when simmering for depth. Cheese swap: aged gouda or raclette for nuttier flavor. If dough sticks during shaping, chill briefly 15 minutes to relax gluten."
- "For busy cooks: potato step can be done day ahead; reheat gently to avoid breaking when topping dough. Smoked meat best added last to keep texture and aroma intact."
- "To avoid sogginess: partially dry potato slices after cooking before layering and avoid excess liquid in dough. Watch oven temp; too hot burns bottom, too low yields pale crust."
introduction: "Diving into focaccia that’s not just dough and herbs. Potatoes and smoky meat punch flavor into long-risen dough. Tried plain, undercooked spuds ruined texture once; simmering in milk slowly perfected softness without falling apart. Garlic bathes the palate, cheese melts into silky pockets. Smoked brisket slices, added off heat, stay tender. Baking transforms the whole into crusty, golden, inviting slab. The smell alone – buttery toast, garlic roasting, meat warming – makes waiting worth it. A rustic mouthful. Been here many times: underbake and chew on dough; overbake and dry cracker. Watch those cues."
ingredientsNote: "Flour amounts reduced from original to balance hydration; less water to avoid wet dough that flattens. Instant yeast trimmed slightly – too much yeast, dough rises too fast, loses flavor complexity. Switched to Yukon gold potatoes; they’re creamy, less waxy than rattes but hold together. Gruyere chosen over cheddar for nuttiness and melt but swap as you wish; gouda, raclette work well. Smoked beef brisket stands in for Montreal smoked meat – similar smoke, less spice, easier to find. Garlic minced fine so it blends; chopped chunks risk burning. Salt is crucial: too much scorches dough, too little dulls everything."
instructionsNote: "Kneading is key: you need a dough that yields finger dimples without collapsing – elasticity is texture foundation. Bulk rising slow in warm humid spot lets flavors develop, yeast doesn't rush. When simmering potatoes in milk and garlic, stir often; scorch risk lurks. Potatoes al dente; mush ruins topping texture. Drain but keep some milky sheen for moisture. When spreading dough in pan, don’t pull too thin; 1 cm thickness holds toppings snug and rises well. Dimpling traps oils and pockets of flavor. Cheese beneath potatoes prevents sogginess and gives gooey texture. Bake until crust golden, cheese bubbling, edges crisp to touch. Smoked meat slice last minute; residual heat finishes warming without turning tough. Rest briefly; cutting too soon loses steam; too long cools crust."
tips:
- "Potatoes simmer in milk with garlic until tender but keep shape; stir often or milk scorches; drain but keep some milk clinging for moist topping; water drains dry out topping – avoid that. Yukon golds hold better than ratte; waxy types break down too fast."
- "Dough bulk rise slow warm spot with humidity; overproof sags and crust tough. Underproof leads dense base. Test by poking fingertip; slow spring back means ready. If sticky dough add flour light sprinkle; too tight, splash water for elasticity and dimples that hold shape."
- "Spread dough 1 cm thick on pan with a light oil coat; press fingers deep all over to trap oils and flavors. Don’t pull thin or toppings slide. Cheese under potatoes stops sogginess, melts to creamy pockets. Use gruyere for nuttiness, gouda or raclette swap fine."
- "Add smoked meat slices after baking, off heat; residual warmth avoids drying tough meat texture. Meat salty already, adjust surface salt and pepper sparingly. Rest 5 minutes after slicing before serving to let flavors settle but keep warm."
- "Simmer potatoes day ahead if busy; reheat gently so slices don’t break during assembly. Avoid soggy topping by drying potato slices partially after simmering; excess liquid in dough or oven temp too hot yields dry or pale crust. Watch oven sound cues crust crispness."
faq:
- "q: How to tell when dough is properly risen? a: Poke fingertip; dough caves then springs back slowly but slight dent stays. Too fast bounce means underproof; long hold means overproof, crust tough or dense inside. Temperature slows or speeds yeast rise, humidity helps."
- "q: What if potatoes become mushy? a: Overcooked potatoes break down lose shape; simmer low, stir often so milk doesn’t scorch, keep tender but firm; drain carefully. Substitutes matter; waxy potatoes less suited. Rinse excess starch lightly after cooking if needed."
- "q: Can I use other smoked meats? a: Yes, smoked brisket stands in well for Montreal smoked meat, less spicy but smoky. Pastrami or smoked ham combos also work if sliced thin, added off heat to keep tender. Salt content varies, taste as you season."
- "q: How long store leftover focaccia? a: Wrap tight; fridge up to 3 days, reheat oven or toaster oven for crisp edges. Freeze portions in airtight bags, defrost then warm slow; avoid microwave or soggy crust develops. Best eaten same day but manageable leftovers."
