instructions:
- "Heat nonstick skillet high. Add butter. Brown chicken thighs approx 12 minutes, flipping once."
- "Add potatoes and garlic. Cook stirring often 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Pour in 180 ml broth. Boil covered 20 minutes until potatoes just tender."
- "Add carrots and green beans. Stir well. Cover. Cook 8 minutes or until veggies softened but still have snap."

introduction: "Chicken thighs, plain skin off, chopped big for bold chunks. Butter sizzles hot. Potatoes, golden Yukon Gold, chunked thick. Garlic smashed fine, sharp but not overpowering. Broth split for staged cooking—first to soften potatoes, later mixed with cream for thickening. Swapped out that stir-fry veggie bag. Diced fresh carrots add sweetness, green beans frozen, snap and color retained. Cornstarch blends with cream to thicken sauce gently, no lumps. Dill for fresh herbal twist, going different route than usual parsley. Cook times stretched—more low and slow than quick. Stir often to keep things moving in skillet. Big flavors, creamy sauce clinging to tender chicken and veggies. Simple, achievable, no fuss. Good for any night needing comfort close by."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken thighs work well here—juicy and flavorful even without skin. Butter quantity cut a bit to avoid greasiness. Yukon Gold potatoes chosen for their waxy texture—won’t break down into mush in slower cook. Garlic adds foundational aroma, keep it chopped small but not minced to avoid burning during initial sauté. Switched out premixed vegetable medley for fresh diced carrots—adds sweetness and body—and frozen green beans bring color with minimal prep. Cornstarch makes sauce shine clear and creamy without heaviness; half-and-half balances richness and lightness. Fresh dill herbs provide subtle anise notes, a bit unexpected but nice against creamy background. Salt and pepper to taste; no extra spices added."
instructionsNote: "First, get skillet hot. Brown chicken thighs in butter 12 minutes, turning once for even color and to seal juices in. Add potatoes and garlic, cook stirring often, letting potatoes soften slightly and garlic release aroma without burning. Add just over half the broth, raise heat to boil, cover and reduce heat to simmer to finish cooking potatoes in about 20 minutes. Once potatoes nearly tender, add carrots and green beans, cover and cook additional 8 minutes. In meantime, mix cornstarch, cream, and remaining broth in small cup until smooth, no lumps. Remove lid, pour cream mixture in slowly while stirring constantly. Keep stirring as sauce thickens for about 4 minutes, watching carefully to prevent clumps or scorching. Add chopped dill just before serving for fresh brightness. Serve in warm bowls to hold heat and catch sauce. No bones, no peel—fork goes straight through chicken, chunks hold shape but soft inside."
tips:
- "Brown chicken thighs in hot butter first. Get good color but don’t burn. Flip once mid-way for even cooking. No skin means watch temperature to keep moist inside."
- "Add potatoes and garlic after chicken starts to brown. Garlic chopped fine but not minced to avoid scorch. Stir often so potatoes soften but don’t mush out. Salt and pepper here early for layering flavors."
- "Split broth for two phases. First part softens potatoes under cover and simmer low. Don’t rush. Potatoes chunked big to hold shape during longer cook time. Keep lid tight for steam build-up."
- "When veggies join, cover again but watch timing. Carrots diced fresh add sweetness. Frozen green beans add snap and color—don’t overcook, keep slight crunch. Stir carefully so veggies don’t squish."
- "Cornstarch must mix with cream and last broth portion smoothly. No lumps allowed. Pour slowly into uncovered pan while stirring constantly. Sauce thickens gradually—watch closely to avoid clumps or scorching."
- "Dill chopped fresh sprinkled on top last minute. Adds brightness with subtle anise notes. Not parsley here. Fresh herbs cut harsh creaminess with light herbal twist. Add just before serving to keep herb flavor alive."
- "Use Yukon Gold potatoes for waxy texture. They hold chunks well in slow cook, no mush. Butter amount kept moderate to avoid greasy feel but enough for browning chicken and flavor base. Half-and-half cream balances richness."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken breast instead? a: Yes, but cook time less. Breasts dry out faster. Watch closely. Brown carefully. Maybe add broth sooner. Texture changes—less fat, less flavor but fine if careful."
- "q: What about other veggies? a: Carrots and green beans work best here but swap in similar density ones like peas, zucchini chunks. Avoid watery veggies like mushrooms or leafy greens until end to avoid soggy."
- "q: Sauce not thickening? a: Stir cornstarch mix well before adding. Pour slow. Heat medium not high. Cook after adding slowly so starch activates. Too cold or fast causes lumps or no thickening. Can add more cornstarch paste if needed."
- "q: How long does it keep? a: Store covered in fridge up to 3 days. Reheat gently—microwave or stovetop. Can freeze but sauce texture changes slightly, may need whisk to recombine. Best fresh for cream and dill flavor."
