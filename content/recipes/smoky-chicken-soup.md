slug: "smoky-chicken-soup"
description: "Chunky, smoky chicken soup loaded with corn, chipotle heat, and rich tomato broth. Tortilla strips baked crisp, not fried, layered on top. Uses fire-roasted tomatoes swapped for canned diced tomatoes for earthier flavor. Chicken shredded instead of diced for texture contrast. Chipotle peppers in adobo bring smoky heat, but swap for smoked paprika if can’t find them. Broth simmered gently until aromas mingle, soup thickens slightly. Onion and garlic start caramelizing to deepen base. Oven-baked tortilla strips get crunchy gold edges without grease, tossed mid-bake for even browning. Salt and pepper adjusted through cooking; taste early, adjust late. Perfect for chilly evenings when you want warmth with a little bite."

instructions:
- "==="
- "Heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Toss in chopped onions and minced garlic. Stir often. Onions soften and edges start turning translucent, almost glassy—don’t brown too much. Aromas shift from sharp to sweet and mild. Usually 4–6 minutes here, but watch closely; garlic can burn fast and turn bitter."
- "Add chicken broth, fire-roasted diced tomatoes with juices, shredded chicken, corn, chopped chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, cumin, chile powder, salt, and pepper. Stir thoroughly so spices bloom in liquid. The smashed chipotles release smoky heat that thickens soup base over time."
- "Turn heat up to high briefly till you see small bubbles breaking the surface steadily. Raise aroma levels—smoky, sweet, spicy mingling. Then dial back to medium-low heat. Cover partially, simmer gently. You want the soup to reduce slightly and flavors to marry. Stir once or twice to keep chicken from sticking. Usually 17–22 minutes here, or until corn is tender and soup thickens just a touch."
- "While soup simmers, prepare tortilla strips. Preheat oven to 350F. Toss tortilla strips with olive oil and kosher salt in a bowl, making sure everything’s coated but not drenched."
- "Spread tortilla strips in single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake 8 minutes, then toss to flip for even browning. Continue baking another 7–12 minutes until edges show golden crispness but not burnt. They’ll crisp more as they cool. Remove from oven, let cool to room temp before topping soup."
- "Taste soup near end of simmering time. Adjust salt and pepper. If you want more heat, a pinch of cayenne or a drop more adobo sauce here works wonders. Serve hot topped generously with those crispy tortilla strips. Optional garnishes: diced avocado, shredded cheese, chopped cilantro, lime wedges."

introduction: "Soup thickening, aromas building. I always start by softening onions and garlic until translucent, not browned, because that base sweetens the broth without bitterness. Using shredded chicken gives a nice texture that bites without drying out. Swapping canned diced tomatoes for fire-roasted versions adds smoky depth—the trick for smoky chicken tortilla soup that feels homey. The chipotle in adobo sauce is key for heat and smoky flavor. I’ve poked around with smoked paprika in a pinch, but nothing beats the real deal heat and tang. Baking tortilla strips instead of frying cuts grease and keeps them light, but crisp and golden. It’s about layers of texture, warmth, and smoke on a chilly night."
ingredientsNote: "Olive oil for sautéing plays a crucial role—you want enough to soften onions without too much oiliness. Frozen corn works fine; just thaw and drain well to avoid watering down broth. For chipotle peppers in adobo, adjust quantity carefully; they can overwhelm if rushed in. Sub chili powder with ancho for a milder, fruitier kick or add a pinch of cinnamon for an unexpected warmth twist. Shredded chicken can come from leftovers, rotisserie, or poached fresh—extra cooking can dry it out, so keep it tender. Tortillas work best if slightly stale; fresh tortillas might get floppy after baking. Substitute corn tortillas with flour if preferred, but watch for different crisp times. Consider adding black beans for a different take, or swap half the broth with chicken stock for richer depth."
instructionsNote: "Start with your aromatics; soft onions signal base flavor is positive. Garlic burns easily—watch the clock and smell. Adding liquids and spices simultaneously helps spice dust evenly distribute, avoiding clumps. Bring to boil just enough to ignite simmering, then reduce heat for gentle cooking; rapid boiling will toughen chicken and dull flavors. Stir occasionally but don’t overdo; you want simmering, not stirring frenzy. Baking tortilla strips requires tossing halfway through to brown evenly; under-baked strips get soggy in soup, over-baked get bitter. Cooling strips well before topping keeps them crisp. Taste test frequently at the end—salt and heat adjust best late so you don’t overpower. Serve quickly; tortilla strips soften in soup fast. Leftovers reheat well but add fresh tortilla strips every time."
tips:
- "Watch onions and garlic carefully—translucent, not browned. That sweet base shows up in the broth, bitterness means too long. Smell changes from sharp to soft signals right moment to stop sautéing. Olive oil quantity matters—too little, onions stick; too much, broth feels greasy. I adjust oils often, depends on pan type and heat. Prepping chopped chipotles fine is crucial; big chunks can shock the palate or hide in soup. Keep some adobo sauce handy for extra heat tweaks near end. Timing those tortillas bake is trickier than it sounds; toss halfway for even crisp, don’t eyeball only color."
- "If chipotle peppers aren’t around, swap with smoked paprika. You lose some liquid depth, but smoky warmth stays. Can add a pinch cinnamon or ancho powder for complexity. Corn works better if drained well—wetness dilutes broth, mutes thickening. Frozen or canned both fine but thaw fully before use. Shredded chicken textures give mouthfeel contrast versus diced, so I never dice here. Use leftover rotisserie for speed and juice; poached chicken dries faster so keep simmer brief after adding protein. Salt timing matters; start slightly under then season again late. Soup thickens slowly, patience pays off, stir gently."
- "Heat control swings between medium and medium-low mostly, except quick bubble bursts to raise aromas then back down. Simmer gently for 17 to 22 minutes lets flavors marry without breaking chicken texture. Covers must be partial to allow slight evaporation, too tight traps moisture, soup tastes flat. Crispness on baking strips happens at edges first, watch for golden hints—if all looks pale after full bake, add a few extra minutes but check for burn danger. Tortilla freshness affects texture; stale tortillas crisp better, fresh ones might floppy later in soup. Olive oil on strips coats just enough to crisp, not drench. Toss mid-bake is essential for even color."
- "Don’t over-stir soup; gentle movement protects shredded chicken strands and keeps broth clarity. Smoked paprika works if chipotles are absent, but adobo sauce’s tang hits differently, so add chipotle adobo sauce near finish if going that route. Chiles powder variations change heat subtly—ancho for mild fruity, cinnamon lends unexpected warmth but careful or overpower. Tasting near end is key. Adjust salt, pepper, and heat gradually. If soup tastes flat, a squeeze of lime or splash of broth stock can sharpen flavors. Tortilla strips cool off before topping keeps crunch, piping hot soup softens strips fast. Best add just before serving."
- "Frozen corn vs canned? Both okay but draining is critical. Too much liquid waters broth down. Using rotisserie chicken shortens cooking time; poached takes longer but fresher flavor. Removing over-boiling prevents chicken toughening; small bubbles are the sweet spot. Onion-garlic aromatics shift smell as sautéing progresses; the change signals readiness. If garlic smells bitter, too far gone. Chipotle peppers in adobo vary heat greatly; start smaller quantities, adjust late. Baking temperature steady at 350F standard, keep tabs on tortillas as oven heats unevenly. Tossing midway is non-negotiable for golden edges on all sides."
faq:
- "q: How to adjust heat level? a: Use less chipotle or swap adobo for smoked paprika. Add cayenne or extra adobo sauce late if more punch needed. Heat lingers, taste before overdoing. Remember chipotles differ batch to batch."
- "q: Can I use fresh tomatoes? a: Yes but flavor shifts. Fire-roasted canned tomatoes bring smoky notes upfront. Fresh tomatoes cook longer, may water down broth. Try roasting fresh first if time permits, then dice and add. Otherwise canned best for consistency."
- "q: My tortilla strips go soggy fast. Why? a: Timing issue mostly. Bake strips until edges are golden but not overdone. Cool completely before topping soup. Add strips right before eating, as steam softens them quick. Dry stale tortillas crisp longer versus fresh."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store soup separately from tortilla strips. Soup lasts 3-4 days refrigerated, reheat gently. Tortilla strips keep best in airtight container at room temp max 1-2 days. If strips get limp, re-toast briefly. Avoid mixing till ready to serve."
