ingredients:
- "1 tbsp vegetable oil"
- "1 medium onion chopped"
- "1 medium bell pepper chopped"
- "1 lb ground beef (ground turkey as swap)"
- "6 large flour tortillas"
- "1 cup shredded cheddar cheese divided"
- "1 1/2 cups enchilada sauce"
- "cooking spray"
instructions:
- "Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add chopped onion and bell pepper tossing quickly to coat evenly. Listen for soft sizzling, stir occasionally."
- "Add ground beef breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Cook until well browned, edges slightly crisped, about 9 minutes. Notice aroma turn rich, beef no longer pink. Use a slotted spoon or drain in colander to remove excess grease—prevents soggy burritos."
- "Preheat oven to 350 F. Spray casserole dish liberally with cooking spray to prevent sticking."
- "Divide beef mixture evenly into six portions. Place on each tortilla sprinkle a generous handful of cheddar cheese. Roll burritos tightly, tucking edges to keep filling inside."
- "Arrange burritos seam-side down in the prepared baking dish. Pack close but avoid overlapping to maintain crisp edges."
- "Pour enchilada sauce over burritos evenly, soaking tops but not drowning. Sprinkle remaining cheddar cheese over all burritos for golden melted finish."
- "Bake uncovered about 14-16 minutes until cheese bubbles and light brown spots form. Surface should glisten, sauce thickened slightly."
- "Remove from oven, let sit 3-4 minutes to set. Top with choice of sour cream, diced tomatoes, sliced jalapeños, or chopped cilantro. Serve warm immediately."
introduction: "Smothered beef burritos. Rich, messy, worth the effort. Browned beef mingling with sweet softened onion and bell pepper. That first sizzle as meat hits the pan—gets the nose going. The way tortillas hold the meat, warm and pliable, folding around sharp cheddar that melts into the mix. Enchilada sauce poured over like a blanket, bubbling up in the oven, golden cheese crust forming on top. Made these a dozen times, tried turkey once for lighter fare, worked well. Timing: less about strict minutes, more aroma cues and visual clues. Stop watching the clock once cheese melts, sauce thickens, edges start to brown. Perfect for a weeknight fix or casual weekend dinner. Worth a quick fix or chilling filling ahead to save time. Keep handy tips to avoid soggy burritos or dry edges. No fuss, just solid food comfort with a kick."
ingredientsNote: "Vegetable oil can be replaced with any neutral oil like canola or grapeseed, nothing overpowering. Onions and bell peppers soften aromatically, signal time to add meat. Fresh onion yields best flavor; frozen works in a pinch but less sweet. Ground beef standard, ground turkey or chicken reduce fat and feel lighter—add a splash of olive oil then. Large flour tortillas must be fresh and pliable for rolling, stale ones crack and tear. Cheddar cheese is classic but Monterey Jack or a Mexican blend offers a creamier melt. Enchilada sauce store-bought works fine, or homemade if you’re feeling ambitious. Cooking spray prevents burritos sticking to dish and helps crisp edges. Drain excess grease from meat thoroughly—keeps burritos from turning soggy. Adjust cheese quantity based on how melty or sharp you want the finish. Leftover fillings freeze well, just defrost before rolling."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating oil until it shimmers but doesn’t smoke—too hot burns onions while too low leaves them raw and bitter. Toss peppers in early so they release sweetness and soften alongside onions. Crumbling beef while cooking ensures even browning and prevents clumping. Watch closely as browning progresses; meat should turn deep brown with crisp edges but not dry out. Using a slotted spoon or colander to drain is crucial; grease will otherwise pool during baking, leaving burritos soggy. Wrapping is more efficient if tortillas are warmed slightly to avoid cracking, consider heating them briefly in a dry pan. Packing burritos snug and seam-side down keeps them from unraveling during baking. Pour enchilada sauce evenly but don’t smother; allows cheese to brown and burritos to steam gently underneath. Baking is about watching cheese bubble and turn golden; underbaked cheese stays rubbery while overbaked dries out. Resting after baking sets everything for easier slicing and better texture. Add toppings last minute—adds freshness and balance to richness."
tips:
- "Heat oil until it shimmers, not smokes. Toss onion and bell pepper quickly for even coating. Listen for soft sizzle, smell sweetness building. Avoid burnt edges; pace matters here."
- "Drain grease thoroughly after browning beef. Use slotted spoon or colander. Excess fat pools under burritos during baking leads to soggy results. Keep edges crisp, always."
- "Warm tortillas briefly before rolling; cold ones crack and tear easily. Wrap burritos tight; tuck edges under so fillings don't spill during bake. Seam side down and close packing preserves shape."
- "Pour enchilada sauce evenly over burritos but don’t drown. Let tops soak without smothering cheese layer. Cheese browns best with air exposure; too much sauce keeps it rubbery."
- "Bake at 350 F, watch for cheese bubble, golden brown spots forming. Timing varies, smell rich beef and softened veggies. Let rest 3-4 minutes after baking; sets burrito, easier slicing."
faq:
- "q: Can I use ground turkey instead of beef? a: Yes, swap works well. Add splash olive oil to keep moisture. Turkey browns differently; watch for dryness. Adjust seasonings if needed, milder flavor."
- "q: How to avoid soggy burritos after baking? a: Drain grease well after cooking meat. Warm tortillas first to prevent tears. Don’t smother with sauce; too much moisture sinks crust. Bake uncovered, crisp edges up."
- "q: Can I freeze leftovers? a: Freeze cooked filling separate from tortillas. Wrap rolled burritos tightly in foil or plastic. Defrost fully before reheating. Cheese texture changes; reheat gently to prevent rubberiness."
- "q: Best way to reheat without drying? a: Oven or toaster oven preferred. Cover with foil to keep moisture but avoid soggy crust. Microwave heats unevenly; wrap with damp paper towel if used. Reheat until just bubbly."
