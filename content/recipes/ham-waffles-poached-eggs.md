ingredients:
- "=== Béarnaise ==="
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) sherry vinegar"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) dry vermouth"
- "1 small shallot minced"
- "1 fresh tarragon sprig"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) crushed black peppercorns"
- "3 egg yolks"
- "120 g (1/2 cup) unsalted butter melted and lukewarm"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) chopped fresh tarragon leaves"
- "=== Poached eggs ==="
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) apple cider vinegar"
- "4 eggs"
- "=== Waffles ==="
- "150 g (6 cups) baby spinach"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "4 warm waffles"
- "8 thin ham slices"
instructions:
- "=== Béarnaise ==="
- "Heat vinegar, vermouth, shallot, tarragon sprig, cracked pepper in a small saucepan. Simmer until reduced to about 35 ml (2 tbsp). Strain mixture through a fine sieve into heatproof bowl, discard solids."
- "Whisk in egg yolks immediately. Place bowl over barely simmering water. Whisk continuously until pale, thickened but not grainy, about 5–6 minutes. Avoid overheating to prevent scrambling."
- "Remove from heat. Slowly stream in melted butter, whisking constantly until sauce is glossy and thick but pourable. Stir in chopped tarragon. Season with salt if needed. Thin with a teaspoon of warm water if too dense. Set aside at room temp."
- "=== Poached eggs ==="
- "Bring a pot of salted water to a gentle simmer, stir in apple cider vinegar."
- "Crack eggs individually into cups. Gently slide eggs one by one into water, maintain just below simmering point to avoid tearing whites."
- "Poach 3–4 minutes for runny yolks. Remove with slotted spoon, drain on absorbent paper."
- "=== Waffles ==="
- "Heat olive oil over medium heat in skillet. Quickly sauté spinach until just wilted, 2–3 minutes. Season lightly with salt and pepper."
- "Place warm waffles on plates. Layer spinach evenly over waffles. Drape ham slices over spinach."
- "Add one poached egg per waffle on top."
- "Drizzle generous amounts of béarnaise sauce on eggs and plate."
introduction: "Waffles piled thick, spinach barely wilted, ham thin as paper. Eggs poached just right – whites set, yolks run. A quick béarnaise made with a splash less vinegar, some vermouth giving a green note, stirred gently to creamy. Butter swirls in slowly, thick but flowing. Tarragon chopped in for the herb pop. Vinegar in poach water isn’t wine but cider, mellow and soft. The spinach sautéed in olive oil, switched from butter, light flavor, a nod to freshness. Assembly quick, spinach, ham, eggs, sauced. Breakfast, brunch, or light dinner. Little shifts in quantities make a new take. The dance of textures, colors. Eggs oozing through, ham salty. Sauce glossy, herbaceous. Hurry up or slow down, both suit. No fuss. Just all the bits."
ingredientsNote: "Ratio changes trimmed all liquids by roughly 30 percent, focusing the flavor. The original white wine vinegar swapped to sherry vinegar for a deeper tang, dry vermouth for white wine to enhance aroma without overpowering. Butter reduced but still sufficient to coat silky. Tarragon doubled in final chopped form to balance the loss from less volume. Baby spinach quantity cut; olive oil chosen over butter to keep it light. Vinegar for poaching adjusted to apple cider for gentler acid. Keeps flavors layered but approachable, no muddling. Ham stays thin, portion consistent, balancing vibrant greens and eggs. Eggs four, size large, fresh. Each element streamlined but intact."
instructionsNote: "Start with the sauce reduction, gentle boil down to concentrate. Strain well to avoid bits. Don’t rush whisking yolks over water bath; foamy but not cooked through. Butter trickled in, patience needed to keep emulsion intact. Tarragon added last, bright and fresh. For eggs – simmering water, acid added: prevents whites spreading, keeps edges tidy. Egg-one-at-time - delicate. Three to four minutes poaching, timed right for gooey centers. Spinach quick sauté only, watch it recolor but not turn mushy or bitter. Assemble quickly while warm: waffle base, spinach, ham layer, egg crown. Béarnaise over generously but not drowning. Warm but not hot. Serve immediately to maximize textures and contrasts."
tips:
- "Prep all ingredients first. Organize. Spinach, ham, eggs. Control timing. Spinach sauté quick and watch it closely. Egg poaching needs focus. Keep water gently simmering."
- "For béarnaise, patience is key. Start with the vinegar reduction. Too hot? Scrambled yolks. Stream butter slowly. This emulsifies. Always whisk constantly until thick. Texture matters."
- "Egg poaching, really delicate. Swim eggs in gently. One at a time. Avoid swirling the pot. Just lower each egg. Cook no more than 4 minutes for best yolk. Efficient timing."
- "Waffles, keep them warm. Place right before assembling. Layering: spinach first, ham second, eggs last. Drizzle sauce over. Serve immediately to maintain textures. Flavors shine when fresh."
- "Final thoughts: if sauce is too thick? Thin with warm water, adjust as needed. Don’t skip on tarragon. It enhances flavors. Add fresh herbs for brightness. A bit goes a long way."
faq:
- "q: How to poach eggs perfectly? a: Maintain gentle simmer. Vinegar helps whites hold. Crack into cups first. Carefully slide into water. Timing is essential for runny yolks."
- "q: Can I make the béarnaise sauce ahead? a: Best fresh, but can keep. Let cool, then store. Use in 2 days. Reheat gently—not too hot. Whisk to re-emulsify."
- "q: What type of waffles work best? a: Any waffle is fine. Crispy preferred. Consider texture. Fluffy might get soggy under toppings. Make sure they hold ingredients well."
- "q: What's the best way to store leftovers? a: Store components separately. Waffles in airtight container. Sauce in jar. Reheat in non-stick pan for best results. Eggs won't reheat well."
