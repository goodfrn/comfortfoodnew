title: "Chunky Chocolate Cookies"
slug: "chunky-chocolate-cookies"
description: "Chunky chocolate cookies with slight tweaks for flavor and texture. Uses unbleached flour, brown sugar, and salted butter. Chocolate chunks swapped for bittersweet. Steps reorganized. Baking temp raised to 205°C with shortened time. Less precise sugar amounts to allow texture variation. Subtle cinnamon addition brings warmth. Dough scooped and flattened for even bake. Watch edges for golden-brown cue. Cooling on rack mandatory to avoid soggy bottoms. Great fallback for too soft dough: chill 15 minutes. Flour variation affects spread, so adjust accordingly. A rustic cookie with crackly edges and soft, chewy centers. Simple but enough nuances to keep boredom at bay."

ingredients:
- "142 g unbleached all-purpose flour (slight reduction for chew)"
- "2.5 ml salt (fine sea salt preferred)"
- "1 ml baking soda"
- "110 g salted butter, softened (use unsalted but add pinch extra salt)"
- "150 g packed light brown sugar"
- "1 large egg"
- "2.5 ml vanilla extract"
- "5 ml ground cinnamon (optional, adds warmth twist)"
- "100 g bittersweet chocolate chunks (55-60 % cacao), roughly chopped"
instructions:
- "Position rack middle of oven. Preheat oven 205°C (400°F). Prepare baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat."
- "Whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon in a medium bowl. No lumps allowed. The cinnamon shift is subtle but gives a deeper note."
- "In a bigger bowl, cream softened butter with brown sugar until light and fluffy. Takes about 2-3 minutes at medium-high speed. Scrape sides to avoid weird clumps."
- "Add egg and vanilla to butter mixture. Beat until fully combined - you want a glossy, homogenous mix. No streaks visible."
- "Fold dry ingredients into wet with a spatula or wooden spoon just until combined. Overmix and cookies turn tough. Chunky texture is key. Then fold in chocolate chunks, not chips. You want some melting pockets."
- "Using a 30 ml scoop (about 2 tbsp), drop dough onto baking sheet. Leave 5 cm (2 inches) gap between scoops for spreading. Flatten dough slightly with fingertips to help even bake."
- "Bake in preheated oven 12 to 13 minutes. Cracks start to form, edges turn light golden brown, centers slightly puffed. If cookie still looks wet on top, hold off longer a minute or two."
- "Remove from oven. Let sit 3 minutes on pan before transferring cookies to wire rack. This prevents soggy bottoms from trapped steam."
- "If dough feels too soft or sticky, refrigerate for 15 minutes before baking. This keeps spread tight and texture chewy."
- "Allow cookies to cool completely on rack before attacking. Melted chocolate still gooey but cookie firm around edges signals readiness."
- "Store in airtight container at room temp for 3 to 4 days. Reheat briefly in microwave for just 10 seconds if desired."
introduction: "Soft cookies with bites of bittersweet chocolate. Slightly warmer notes thanks to cinnamon added last minute on whim. Learned that too much sugar makes them spread too thin and dry edges break off like crackers. So dialed brown sugar down a little. Butter with salt makes difference in final taste — no need to salt separately if using salted version. Using chunks instead of chips gave better texture – you get pockets of melted chocolate that aren’t uniform. Baking time needs watching – oven temps vary and seconds count near end. Watch color of edges, cracks in center. Resting on rack mandatory; no skipping, trust me. Cooling traps crunch on outside but center stays chewy. Add cinnamon or not depending on mood put a nice twist. Dusty flour differences affect dough moisture, so don’t get freaked if dough feels softer or firmer than usual. Tried various tweaks – this balance my comfort zone."
ingredientsNote: "Flour unbleached or all purpose works but not bleached — it changes cookie tone and chew. Salted butter adds flavor punch but unsalted butter plus extra salt sprinkled in dough works similarly, just cautious salt levels. Brown sugar packed tight measures vary; a loosely packed cup means lighter cookies. Cinnamon optional but recommended for depth. Chocolate chunks better than chips; chips melt uniformly, chunks create dreamy pockets of chocolate you bite into. Egg size matters; large egg standard but medium eggs also okay, just watch dough texture. Baking soda key for lift but don’t substitute baking powder easily, it’s a different chemical reaction. If no parchment, silicone mats prevent cookie sticking. For allergy swaps, vegan butter and aquafaba instead of egg can work but flavor and texture change markedly. Sugar substitutes tricky; brown sugar imparts moisture and color, pure white sugar gives different texture."
instructionsNote: "Creaming butter and sugar until pale and fluffy critical — skips gritty sugar or uneven mixing. Folding dry ingredients gently avoids tough cookies; over mixing develops gluten. Flattening dough balls slightly promotes even cooking and helps shape; balls left untouched tend to peak and crack oddly. The smell shifting from buttery sweet to toasty hints near doneness. Crack appearance signals moisture level — too shiny means underbaked. Cooling on wire rack after partial rest on pan prevents soggy undersides from steam trapped underneath. Dough too soft? Chill it. Makes shaping easier and reduces spreading during bake. Oven temps vary wildly between models — investing in oven thermometer lessens surprise charred edges or raw middles. Removing cookies early means residual heat finishes carryover baking — better chewy center than dry overbaked one. Storage airtight keeps them fresh but cookies lose crisp edge after 2 days. Quick microwave zap revives slightly but avoid overheating or becomes rubbery."
tips:
- "Cream butter and brown sugar until pale, fluffy; scrapes sides regularly to avoid clumps. Overcreaming ruins texture; keep eye on stages. Cookie dough should feel tacky but firm enough to hold shape. Folding dry ingredients gently matters - overmix and get tough cookies. This part subtle but crucial; watch for lumps especially when adding cinnamon, no clumping allowed."
- "Flatten scooped dough balls with fingertips, about half a centimeter. Helps baking evenness; cookies spread and rise more controlled. If dough super soft, chill 15 minutes first. Cooler dough shrinks spread; warmer dough spreads faster but risks thin dry edges. Adjust with flour swings - unbleached flour adds chew, bleached gives soft crumb but avoid here."
- "Baking time critical; 12-13 minutes at 205°C optimal for edges golden, center puffed but glossy. If cracks appear shiny or surface jiggly, hold extra minute or two; residual heat finishes bake inside. Oven thermometer is best investment for consistency; many ovens run hot or cold, throwing cues off."
- "Salt choices affect flavor punch; salted butter works well but watch salt levels if using unsalted plus salt. Sea salt preferred for subtle grain texture. Brown sugar pack tightness varies; loosely packed yields lighter cookie color and texture. Bittersweet chunks create pockets that melt unevenly; avoid chips for this reason."
- "Cooling on wire rack mandatory; cookies continue setting, avoid steam trapping underneath that results in soggy bottoms. Remove from pan after 3 minutes rest so cookies firm to touch but not cold. Store airtight at room temp max 4 days. Microwave 10 seconds revives warmth but avoid overheating - turns rubbery fast."
faq:
- "q: Can I use baking powder instead of baking soda? a: No, different chemical reaction happens. Baking powder won’t lift much here. Cookies might get dense or flat, won’t crack same way. Stick with soda, really key for texture and rise."
- "q: What if chocolate chunks melt too much? a: Use larger chunks; smaller chips tend to melt uniformly, losing texture contrast. Chunks create gooey pockets and firm edges. If too melty, chill dough before scooping. Keeps pockets intact, better bite."
- "q: Dough too sticky to handle? a: Chill 15 minutes. Dough firms up, easier to scoop and flatten. If still sticky, add small amount flour but watch spread. Over flour dries dough out. Sticky dough means more spread, thinner cookies prone to break edges."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container room temp best 3-4 days. Refrigerate if long term but can harden edges. Microwave zap 10 seconds warms inside without rubbery skin. Avoid freezing unless wrapped tightly, thawing can affect moist crumb. Real talk, fresh cookies taste best."
