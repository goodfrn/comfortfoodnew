slug: "rustic-spinach-pie"
description: "Spinach folded with creamy ricotta and crumbly feta creates a vibrant filling. Layers of delicate phyllo dough brushed generously with butter crisp and brown as they bake. Shallots and garlic soften, releasing savory scents. The pie browns unevenly, foil shields it from burning. Cooling settles the flavors. Substitution for ricotta possible with cream cheese, spinach must be well-drained to avoid sogginess. Tossing with tongs wilts spinach quickly, keeping it bright green. Timing based on visual cues, not clocks. A classic Greek-inspired dish reworked with slight twists and careful technique."

ogDescription: "Spinach wilts fast, softening garlic and shallots under layers of buttered phyllo. Rich cheese and egg bind filling. Baked golden with rustic edges, cooling sets flavor."

ingredients:
- "6 tablespoons olive oil"
- "2 shallots finely diced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "2 pounds fresh spinach tightly packed"
- "1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley"
- "1 large egg beaten"
- "1 cup ricotta cheese drained"
- "1 cup feta cheese crumbled"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "14 sheets phyllo dough thawed"
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter melted"
instructions:
- "Set oven to 350°F. Grease 9x9 inch baking dish with nonstick spray or brush oil."
- "Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add shallots and garlic. Cook stirring, soften just until fragrant and translucent, not brown—about 3-4 minutes."
- "Add fresh spinach and parsley. Use tongs to toss continuously until spinach collapses, shrinks, and loses raw edge but stays bright. Remove from heat immediately to prevent overcooking. Let cool 5-7 minutes to avoid curdling egg."
- "Beat egg in medium bowl. Mix in well-drained ricotta, crumbled feta, and salt. Squeeze leftover water from spinach before adding to egg-cheese mixture. Fold together gently but thoroughly."
- "Line bottom of baking dish with one sheet of phyllo dough, letting edges hang over sides. Brush with melted butter. Repeat 3 more times layering and buttering between sheets. Ends will drape; tuck after filling."
- "Spoon spinach and cheese filling evenly over phyllo base. Fold phyllo edges toward center to contain filling. It looks messy but that’s rustic charm."
- "Layer remaining phyllo sheets on top, brushing each sheet liberally with butter. Tuck sides into dish carefully to seal."
- "Bake uncovered for about 28-32 minutes until phyllo is deep golden and edges crisp. If top darkens too fast, tent loosely with aluminum foil to prevent burning."
- "Remove from oven, allow to cool at least 10 minutes for filling to set and flavors meld before slicing and serving."
introduction: "Spinach pie pigments the kitchen with green and bubbling butter-soaked phyllo. Garlic and shallots—the base aromatics—soften into sweet pungency. Spinach rapidly wilts under the dance of tongs; watch it collapse. Mixing ricotta with salty feta is where the filling finds soul, binding with a beaten egg for structure. Butter, ridiculous amounts dripping on phyllo sheets, transforms paper-thin layers into crisp crags. Baking is a sensory ballet—listen for soft crackles, watch for golden edges blooming. Tent with foil if browning races ahead. Let it cool or the filling will spill; Patience here is key. I swap ricotta with cream cheese on lazy days for richness; also, parsley is non-negotiable—adds herbaceous brightness to tame the richness. Never skip drying spinach thoroughly, soggy phyllo ruins all. This pie is rustic, it’s imperfect, but it’s always worth it."
ingredientsNote: "Remember to squeeze spinach well to prevent watery filling that sogs phyllo. Ricotta can be replaced with cream cheese for a denser, richer texture—makes pie creamier but heavier. Feta can't be swapped easily, it adds essential salty tang, though half the amount paired with goat cheese works if craving a milder bite. Fresh parsley is vital, it cuts heavy dairy with fresh herbal notes. Butter should be melted but not nutty browned; hot butter flakes tear delicate phyllo so brush gently. Use thawed phyllo properly—keep covered with a damp towel to avoid drying and cracking while you work. If you buy frozen spinach, squeeze extra well and reduce sautéing time since it’s pre-cooked. Kosher salt recommended for balanced seasoning; table salt can overshoot saltiness. Olive oil warms flavors in the filling but avoid overpowering with excessive amounts—3-4 tablespoons already scent the dish."
instructionsNote: "Start by getting your baking dish greased—nonstick helps immensely when sliding out portions later. Olive oil heats first to gently release shallots and garlic aromas without browning prematurely—too hot burns garlic bitter fast. Toss spinach with tongs; spoon mashes leaves unevenly and prolongs wilting, tongs mean speed and uniform cooking with less juice. Cooling spinach before mixing with egg prevents scrambling or lumps in filling. Phyllo work is delicate—lay one sheet at a time and butter between each for flaky layers. Don't overdo butter; underwatering means dry, stiff pastry. Fold edges messy? Totally fine, rustic look authentic. Watch oven closely after 25 minutes; too much heat browns phyllo sheets front and center first. Foil tenting saves burnt tops without losing heat. Let pie rest after baking —cutting too soon spills filling. It firms and sets while cooling, improving texture a lot. Slice with a serrated knife for clean edges that don't tear layers apart."
tips:
- "Squeeze spinach aggressively after washing. Any leftover water ruins phyllo layers. Use clean kitchen towel or press with heavy pans. Spinach texture changes quick when tossed; use tongs to keep it bright green and prevent mush. Timing matters here; overcook and you lose those fresh notes."
- "Butter must be melted but cool enough not to cook phyllo sheets on contact. Hot butter flakes tear dough; brush gently with a soft pastry brush. Layering phyllo takes patience — one sheet at a time with butter between. Skip dousing; too much clogs crispness, too little creates brittle bake."
- "Sub ricotta with cream cheese if you want denser filling but beware heavier mouthfeel. Feta’s salty kick balances cream cheese richness; never drop feta amount below half or filling flattens. If goat cheese is used, blend carefully for milder salt punch."
- "Phyllo sheets thawed fully, kept under damp towel. Dry sheets crack and break when folded; frustrations multiply especially when folding edges. Use nonstick spray on baking dish. It helps scrap-free slices later because pie sticks badly otherwise."
- "Keep oven temp steady around 350°F. Watch browning after 25 minutes; phyllo burns fast front and center. Foil tent it loosely to slow top darkening without losing heat below. Cooling essential — filling sets as it rests. Cut with serrated knife for clean layered slices."
faq:
- "q: How do I prevent soggy phyllo? a: Drain spinach very well, squeeze water out multiple times. Use towel. Cool spinach before mixing egg. Too much moisture = soggy all the way. Butter layer dry sheets well, but not drowning in butter. Bake long enough to crisp layers."
- "q: What if I don’t have ricotta? a: Cream cheese swaps fine, thicker texture though. Blend evenly with egg to avoid lumps. Forget ricotta? Try cottage cheese as last resort but expect distinct texture. Feta stays crucial for salt balance. No feta means overall bland filling."
- "q: Why does my spinach pie burn unevenly? a: Oven hotspots common. Rotate pie after 15 minutes. Tent foil top loosely if edges brown before center. Phyllo bakes fast and burns fast. Avoid opening oven too often or heat drops erratically."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool down completely first. Wrap tight in foil or air-tight container. Refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat wrapped to keep moisture. Freezing possible but phyllo soggy next day. Better warm fresh or next day fridge slice."
