ingredients:
- "Vegetable oil enough to fill saucepan halfway for frying"
- "1 can large flaky biscuits, each biscuit halved by pulling layers"
- "1 1/4 cups cherry pie filling or substitute mixed berry jam"
- "1/2 cup powdered sugar"
- "2 Tbsp whole milk"
- "1 Tbsp light corn syrup, or honey alternative for glaze"
instructions:
- "Fill heavy saucepan about halfway with vegetable oil; choose 2 to 3 quart size so dough balls swim freely when frying."
- "Open biscuits; split each by gently peeling flaky layers at center so dough remains thick enough; avoid over-rolling or stretching too thin."
- "Flatten each biscuit half gently with fingertips or rolling pin just enough to make a disc, roughly 3 inches diameter. Don’t roll wafer-thin or risk bursting during frying."
- "Put a heaping tablespoon of cherry filling in center of each disc. Use thicker jam if pie filling too runny for snug enveloping."
- "Pinch edges firmly all the way around dough to seal — don’t just press; better squeeze edges and tuck ends under, rolling into tight ball shape, makes fry crispier crust without leaks."
- "Bring oil to steady 320-330°F, keep constant — oil too hot scorches outside, too low soaks oil in dough, greasy results follow."
- "Carefully lower 2-3 dough balls with slotted spoon in oil; they should float and bubble. Use spoon to gently roll them around; flip every minute so even golden all sides, about 4-6 minutes total. Listen to frying start slow, then ramp bubbles, look for deep golden brown."
- "Watch oil carefully; thermometer your best friend. Adjust burner mid-fry to keep temp steady; cold oil droops batter, hot oil burns edges fast leaving raw inside."
- "Remove pie bombs with slotted spoon; drain on paper towels. Don’t pile or steam ruins crust."
- "Whisk powdered sugar, milk, and corn syrup to glossy drizzle glaze. If too thick add milk 1 tsp at a time."
- "Toss or dip hot fried bombs in glaze. Lift, let excess drip. Place on parchment or wire rack to set, 8-12 minutes for smooth, shiny coating."
- "Serve fresh or after glaze firmed. Store leftovers airtight, reheat lightly for crispness."
introduction: "Ever started with flaky biscuit dough, ended with sad soggy blobs because oil was off or edges didn’t seal? Yeah me too. Learned that finesse with pinch and temp control matter big time. These cherry pie balls grab that sticky sweet inside, fry to golden puff. Crunch gives way to juicy hit. The oil should sing as you gently roll them, not spit or choke with smoke. Glaze isn’t just sugar slapped on; it’s that final gloss, binding sweetness and sealing in crisp. Tried wild berry jam once — worked well but less juice burst. Don’t rush sealing or temp; better fewer cooked right than batches soft or burnt. Treat as snack, not sweet snack cake; crisp outside, warm cherry inside, fleeting satisfying crunch and sweet juice pop."
ingredientsNote: "Biscuits can be store bought with flaky layers; avoid those meant for baking in pan only as their dough is dense. Pull flakes apart carefully; rolling too thin invites breakage and juice leakage. Cherry pie filling is best if thick; watery types cause oil spatter and sogginess, use mixed berry jam for twist and extra tang. Vegetable oil keeps neutral flavor and high smoke point; can use canola or light olive if needed. Corn syrup in glaze adds shine, but honey or agave substitute works — remember honey thickens glaze differently, adjust milk to loosen. Powdered sugar and milk set consistency; add milk sparingly to prevent glaze too runny. Don’t skip rolling edges under; improves frying shape and avoids dough unravel during cooking."
instructionsNote: "Start heating oil early; let it approach 320°F over medium flame so you don’t overshoot and scorch. Test pinch pressure on dough to ensure a seal that won’t pop open mid-fry — no gaps or thin spots or filling spills. Swap thermometer for cooking chips as temp backup — if chips brown in 30 seconds, oil ready. When dropping dough balls in oil, lower gently to avoid splashes. Keep stirring and turning dough balls regularly with slotted spoon to prevent hot spots or sticking to the pan. Watch that slow bubble, listen as surface changes from wet look to dry, crust forming. Fry usually takes 4-6 minutes; color is best indicator — golden brown all around is the cue. After draining excess oil on paper towels, toss immediately in glaze while bombs still warm, or glaze won’t stick. Cool on rack so crispiness remains. Store leftovers airtight; reheat in toaster oven for revived crust but avoid microwave or they sog."
tips:
- "Keep oil temp steady at 320-330 degrees Fahrenheit. Too hot burns crust fast, raw center; too low means greasy soggy bomb. Use a thermometer or test with cooking chips browning in 30 seconds."
- "Pinch edges tight around cherry filling. Don’t just press edges shallow; squeeze and tuck ends under. Thin edges pop and cause filling leaks. Pull biscuit layers gently to keep thickness around three inches diameter for sturdy dough."
- "Cherry pie filling should be thick, not runny. Runny filling spats oil, adds sogginess. If pie filling too loose, swap for mixed berry jam or thickened jam. Thicker jam holds better in fried dough envelope during cooking."
- "Glaze needs to be shiny but not sloppy. Whisk powdered sugar, milk, corn syrup or honey alternative slowly adding milk if too thick. Toss hot bombs quickly after frying, or glaze won’t adhere well."
- "Turn dough balls often during frying with slotted spoon to crisp even golden crust. Listen for change in frying sounds—slow bubbling to lively. Look for deep golden brown all sides around 4-6 minutes. Overcook makes dry inside; undercook leaves dough raw."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other dough types? a: Biscuit dough best for flaky layers. Dense dough breaks or won’t puff. Store bought flaky halves pulled apart work well. Avoid heavy bread dough; no puff or crisp."
- "q: What if my oil smokes? a: Oil too hot. Lower heat immediately. Start at medium, test temp. Burnt taste follows. Can add fresh oil if burnt bits appear. Use neutral oils like vegetable or canola for high smoke point."
- "q: Glaze too runny or thick? a: Add milk little by little to thin runny glaze. If too thick, more milk gently added or slight heat in microwave. Honey or agave makes glaze thicker than corn syrup; adjust milk accordingly."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container cool. Reheat in toaster oven for crisp crust. Avoid microwave or bombs sog. Can keep at room temp for few hours but glaze softens."
