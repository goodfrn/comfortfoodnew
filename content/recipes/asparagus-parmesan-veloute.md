title: "Asparagus Parmesan Velouté with Poached Egg"
slug: "asparagus-parmesan-veloute"
description: "Velvety asparagus soup with a cheesy punch from aged parmesan. Poached eggs sit on toasted sourdough croutons, creating a contrast of creamy and crisp. Tender asparagus heads finish the dish with a touch of freshness. Chicken broth is swapped for vegetable stock to lighten flavors, potatoes replaced with parsnips for earthier undertones. White wine vinegar sharpens poaching water; crème fraîche adds a subtle tang. Timings flexible, relying on texture cues from tender asparagus and softly set eggs. Ideal for a spring gathering or a cozy starter. Six servings."

ingredients:
- "1 medium onion, finely chopped"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "25 ml unsalted butter"
- "1.2 liters vegetable stock"
- "2 medium parsnips, peeled and diced"
- "600 g asparagus, trimmed, cut into segments (reserve 18 tips whole)"
- "200 ml grated aged Parmesan"
- "80 ml crème fraîche"
- "1 liter water"
- "30 ml white wine vinegar"
- "6 fresh eggs"
- "6 sourdough croutons, toasted"
- "Parmesan shavings"
- "Salt"
- "Black pepper freshly ground"
instructions:
- "Get the onion and garlic sweating gently in butter over medium heat; don't rush—onions soften to translucent, not browned. Smell that sweet onion scent filling the kitchen? Good."
- "Add the vegetable stock plus diced parsnips. Bring to low boil, then drop heat and let it bubble softly. Parsnips should be fork-tender in about 18 minutes. Watch, no stirring too much or you’ll disturb the delicate tuber."
- "Stir in asparagus pieces minus tips. Cook another 4 minutes. Test: asparagus should break with slight resistance, not mush."
- "Blend the hot soup with parmesan—go for a blender or immersion, depending on patience. I like chunk-free, so run through a fine sieve if you want silky smooth."
- "Whisk in crème fraîche now; it cools down soup slightly but adds a pleasant tart creaminess. Salt and pepper; taste as you go."
- "Meanwhile, blanch reserved asparagus tips in boiling salted water about 2 minutes till bright green and tender-crisp. Shock in ice water immediately to halt cooking and keep color sharp. Drain well."
- "Set a heavy saucepan of water to a gentle simmer, add white wine vinegar. Bring to a barely-there simmer. Important: water should not boil violently or you’ll shred your eggs."
- "Crack each egg separately into a small cup. Swirl simmering water gently, slide egg in carefully. Poach until whites set but yolks wiggle — roughly 3-4 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon; drain on paper towel. Keep warm."
- "Ladle soup evenly into warmed bowls. Place a toasted sourdough crouton in center of each dish. Top with poached egg. Arrange blanched asparagus tips around for texture contrast."
- "Finish with plenty of parmesan shavings and a crack of black pepper. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Starting with buttery onions melting into garlic, simmering earthy parsnips and asparagus pieces. The aroma fills the kitchen, hazy steam clouds. Parmesan melts in, thickens smooth, silky elegance. Blanched asparagus tips—vibrant, tender, chilled crisp by ice; those color and snap details matter. Poaching eggs is a dance—vinegar tang tightens whites, water just at shimmer to cradle them gently. Eggs resting on toasted sourdough, rustic crunchy counterpoint to soft yolk and velvety soup slurps. The tang of crème fraîche cuts richness without cloying; a pinch of black pepper wakes the dish. An unfussy, layered bowl. The magic is in timing and feel, not a watch."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping potatoes for parsnips ups the flavor profile with subtle sweetness and depth, but any root veggie can substitute—turnips or even celeriac, if you’re adventurous. Skip chicken stock for vegetable to keep it light and vegetarian friendly, though richer stocks suit heavier appetites. Crème fraîche is easier to temper in the soup than heavy cream—if you only have cream, reduce heat before adding or risk curdling. Parmesan is critical; opt for a good aged wedge rather than pregrated powder. Sourdough croutons hold up better under the soup’s weight than softer breads; dry them out thoroughly or they’ll soak too fast. For vinegar, white wine vinegar lends finesse—avoid malt or balsamic here."
instructionsNote: "Don’t rush sweating onions; they should soften without browning or becoming bitter. Parsnips need gentle simmering until fork tender—stick a knife in, test for softness rather than relying on time. Adding asparagus tips later helps keep them firm, visually distinct, and texturally vivid rather than mushy alongside the puree. Blanching followed by an ice bath locks their color and crunch. Poaching eggs demands patience: the water temperature’s crucial—no boil. Vinegar helps whites coagulate but a sharp bite can get lost if overused. Swirling creates a gentle vortex to wrap whites neatly around yolks—skip swirl, get ragged edges. Toasted sourdough croutons balance textures and soak but hold shape only briefly, so assemble just before serving. Parmesan shavings for finish—not in soup—add that rustic sharp burst when bitten through."
tips:
- "Sweat onions low and slow, key is translucent not golden. Browning kills mild sweetness. Garlic follows fast; don’t let it burn. Butter’s gentle melt lets aromatics bloom without stress. Smell changes slowly, subtle but reliable."
- "Simmer parsnips gently, low bubble only. Stabbing with fork beats timer; softness varies. Over stirring breaks them down. Keep fragile and structured. Parsnips add earth, sweeter than potato, so adjust salt more cautiously."
- "Asparagus segments in late stir avoid mush. Four minutes hot enough but check bite; slight resistance means not mush, texture alive. Blend fully, then sieve if feeling coarse. Parmesan needs dissolved fully to thicken without grain."
- "Crème fraîche cools soup temp, prevents curdle. Add at end off heat or very low heat. Heavy cream demands tempering; sprinkle in slow or separate whisking. Salt and pepper last, taste in stages — Parmesan levels vary."
- "Blanch asparagus tips bright green about two minutes only. Ice bath shock crucial; locks crunch and color sharpness. Drain thoroughly or dilute soup hot later, watery tips kill texture contrast. Store tips cold till use."
- "Poach eggs in barely simmering water with just white wine vinegar. No boil, no ripples or eggs fall apart. Swirl water gently pre-drop wraps whites cleanly; no swirl means ragged edges but yolk intact. Timing precise 3-4 min whites set, yolks soft."
- "Toasted sourdough croutons need drying out well; soft bread soaks fast and collapses under warm soup. Toast not burn, but thoroughly crisp then cool. Assemble bowls last minute or croutons lose crunch quickly. Parmesan shavings go on top, dry sharp bursts separate from soup."
faq:
- "q: How to keep asparagus crisp? a: Blanch quick, ice bath right away. No overcook or mush. Drain well before plating. Cold stops cooking. Mild salt in water helps color."
- "q: Can I sub parsnips? a: Turnips or celery root work but flavor shifts. Parsnips sweeter, earthier. Potatoes possible but less depth. Adjust salt, expect difference not flaw."
- "q: What if egg whites fall apart? a: Water too hot or no vinegar; acid firms whites fast. Simmer not boil critical. Gentle swirl helps wrap whites tight. Don’t overcrowd pot."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Soup fridge sealed, reheat gently avoiding boil. Eggs best fresh but peeled hard-cooked keep short term. Croutons store separate, toast again if soggy."
