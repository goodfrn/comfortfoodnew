description: "A dairy-free spin on classic crème brûlée using soy beverage and creamy soy cooking blend. Infused with chai spices—cinnamon, black peppercorn, cardamom, clove, ginger, and nutmeg—plus a splash of English Breakfast tea. Egg yolks and brown sugar make the custard base. Baked gently in a water bath until set, chilled thoroughly, then topped with caramelized sugar. Five servings. Slightly adjusted spice quantities and cooking times to tweak texture. Cardamom pods swapped for ground turmeric for earthiness. Coconut sugar replaces regular sugar for topping, adding a deeper caramel note."

ingredients:
- "200 ml soy beverage unsweetened"
- "270 ml creamy soy cooking blend (Belsoy)"
- "1 small cinnamon stick"
- "4 black peppercorns"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric (instead of cardamom pods)"
- "1 clove"
- "Pinch ground ginger"
- "Pinch ground nutmeg"
- "1 tbsp English Breakfast tea leaves"
- "5 egg yolks"
- "140 ml brown sugar (lightly packed)"
- "Coconut sugar for topping"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack mid-level. Heat oven to 165°C (329°F)."
- "In a small pot, warm soy beverage and soy cooking blend with cinnamon, peppercorns, clove, turmeric, ginger, nutmeg. Heat until just boiling, then remove from heat."
- "Add English Breakfast tea. Steep 6 minutes. Strain through fine sieve."
- "Whisk egg yolks with brown sugar in bowl until thickened."
- "Combine hot spiced soy mix slowly into egg mixture, whisk continuously."
- "Strain mixture again to remove sediment and smooth custard."
- "Distribute custard among 4 ramekins (about 180 ml each) or up to 5 ramekins (125 ml each)."
- "Place ramekins inside larger dish. Fill dish with hot water to halfway up ramekin sides, careful not to splash in custard."
- "Bake 40 to 45 minutes. Custard should be mostly set with slight wobble in center."
- "Remove from oven. Cool 20 minutes at room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap."
- "Chill in fridge minimum 4 hours, preferably overnight."
- "Before serving, sprinkle each custard with thin layer of coconut sugar."
- "Caramelize sugar with kitchen torch or oven broiler set on high, watching closely, until sugar bubbles and turns amber."
- "Serve immediately. Sugar hardens quickly, cracks when tapped."
introduction: "Dairy-free means soy base. Creamy, lush yet light. Spices punch chai vibes: cinnamon, pepper, clove, turmeric replacing cardamom adds earth. Tea steeped in heat, infuses aroma. Yolks and sugar blend custard magic. Water bath keeps custard silky — no cracks, no bubbles, just smooth set. Brown sugar gives richness, coconut sugar caramelizes sending burnt-sugar fragrance. Bake gently, patience key. Cool well, then torching time for signature crackle sugar crust. Choppy spice notes, warm and cozy. Not the usual vanilla but chai, smoky, layered. Simple ingredients, complex flavors. Vegan, gluten-free, allergen-conscious. Feed 4 or 5, snapping pictures, cracking sugar crusts with forks. Time shifts slightly to lock custard texture. Flavor swap—turmeric for cardamom—makes it unexpected. Experiment with sugar types, don’t skimp on chilling. Sweet, spiced, satisfying."
ingredientsNote: "Soy drink and creamy soy cooking blend together build creaminess without lactose or dairy. Cinnamon stick for woody spice, black peppercorns add mild heat. Turmeric grounds replace cardamom pods—warmer, earthier, less floral, hint of bitterness to balance sweetness. Clove whole for aroma; ground ginger and nutmeg pinch add depth. English Breakfast tea gives base herbal complexity. Egg yolks emulsify, enrich custard. Brown sugar—lightly packed—slightly changes sweetness profile, more molasses notes. Coconut sugar topping adds caramel undertones, melts differently from granulated sugar, but still creates crispy layer. Allergen-free tweaks keep intact layers of flavor without added nuts, gluten, or dairy. Measure spices precisely, fresh ingredients best. Tea steep time important—oversteep turns bitter. Straining custard removes spice bits for smooth mouthfeel."
instructionsNote: "Rack placement mid-oven ensures even heat. Oven temp lowered slightly to 165°C slows custard cooking, keeps texture smooth. Heat milk base gently until near boil, not roiling. Infuse spices and tea off heat for max flavor without bitterness. Whisk yolks and brown sugar long enough to dissolve sugar, lighten color. Gradually temper eggs with warm soya mixture to avoid scrambling. Double straining custard helps prevent lumps from spices or coagulated eggs. Ramekins placed in water bath prevents edges from cooking too fast. Water should be hot but not boiling; simmering bubbles disrupt custard. Bake 40-45 minutes, test with gentle jiggle; custard should still jiggle slightly near center. Cool 20 minutes before covering to avoid condensation. Chill minimum 4 hours; longer if possible. Sprinkle coconut sugar evenly to prevent clumping; torch from center outwards. Caramelize sugar fast to avoid heating custard below. Serve at once, sugar hard but brittle."
tips:
- "When steeping the tea, don't rush. Six minutes is key. Too long, it turns bitter. Remove leaves carefully. Strain well."
- "Custard texture is all about the water bath. Bake at a low temp. This way edges won't bake too fast. Slow baking, silky custard."
- "Chill the custard well. Four hours minimum, overnight is better. Cover with plastic wrap to avoid condensation ruining the top."
- "Sprinkle sugar evenly. Too much on one spot causes uneven melting. Aim for thin, uniform layer. Watch when torching."
- "For caramelizing, don't heat too long. Sugar melts fast. Move torch around. Don't stop until it bubbles and turns amber."
faq:
- "q: How do I prevent custard from cracking? a: Focus on water bath technique. Water shouldn't boil, just gently simmer. Bake slow."
- "q: Can I substitute the soy products? a: Yes, almond milk works too. Different flavor though, but still rich. Adjust for creaminess."
- "q: What if I oversteep the tea? a: If it's bitter, balance it with sweetener later. More sugar can help. But prefer timing right."
- "q: How should I store leftovers? a: Fridge is best, cover tightly. Use within two days for optimal texture. Chilled, but can soften."
