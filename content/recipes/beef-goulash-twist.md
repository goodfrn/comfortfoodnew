description: "A hearty beef goulash simmered slowly with swapped elbow macaroni for shells, infused with smoky chipotle powder replacing paprika. Ground beef browned with onions and garlic introduces base aromatics. Tomato sauce and diced tomatoes blend into a rich sauce, simmered gently then thickened with pasta and corn. Cooks down to a slightly thicker consistency. Topped with sharp cheddar, melty contrast. Kitchen smells bold, meats browned nicely without drying out. Macaroni retains bite, no mush. Simple pantry swap makes a noticeable flavor pop. Solid for weeknights, leftovers gain depth overnight."

ingredients:
- "2 pounds ground beef (85% lean)"
- "1 large onion, chopped"
- "3 cloves garlic, minced"
- "1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce"
- "1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice"
- "1 1/4 cups water"
- "1 tablespoon chipotle powder"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
- "1 1/2 cups uncooked small pasta shells"
- "1 cup frozen corn kernels"
- "1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese"
instructions:
- "Brown beef and onions in a heavy dutch oven over medium-high heat until no pink remains. The sizzle will settle into a steady pop sound when ready. Drain all excess fat or the sauce turns greasy."
- "Return beef and onions to pot. Stir in minced garlic. Cook over medium heat. When garlic aroma hits, around 60 seconds, stop before it browns or smells bitter. Garlic burns fast here."
- "Pour in tomato sauce, canned tomatoes with juices, and water. Sprinkle chipotle powder instead of paprika. Add salt and pepper. Stir well. Reduce heat to low and let simmer uncovered. Watch for gentle bubbling, not a boil. 17 minutes or until sauce slightly thickens and deepens in color."
- "Stir in uncooked pasta shells and corn kernels. Keep the pot uncovered and stir every few minutes to avoid pasta sticking. The subtle clinking sound of pasta hitting pot helps gauge doneness. Cook another 11 minutes or until pasta is tender but firm to bite."
- "Ladle hot goulash into bowls, sprinkle with cheddar cheese. Let sit a minute to melt. The sharp cheddar adds punch, melts smoother than milder cheese I've tried. Serve with rustic bread to mop up sauce."
introduction: "Think goulash—hearty, thick, American style. Ground beef browned just right, onions translucent, garlic stepping in quick with that punch. Not delicate enough for me to dial back. Swapping paprika for chipotle powder went well—smoke and heat balance. I usually ditch elbow macaroni sometimes; shells better hold bits of sauce, keeps texture interesting bite after bite. Stirring often crucial or pasta lumps, trust me. Corn sneaks in sweetness, a bit surprising next to chipotle but does work. Cheese melt topping is non-negotiable, gives salt and creamy foil. Learned that times flex depending on pot and stove but trusting sight and sound—simmer curls around the pot, thickens visibly. Smell nose confirms. Leftovers thicken further—the flavors meld, better day after. Too watery or dry? Adjust water slowly. Sauce consistency key, not soup but not cement either. Cut corners on onions at your risk—adds base flavor layer, don’t skip garlic or it flatlines flavor. Easy weeknight, stove handled, no fuss."
ingredientsNote: "Ground beef 85% lean hits balance of flavor and fat. Leaner is dry, fattier is greasy, so drain well after browning or sauce ruins. Onion adds sweetness, important base note, chop size depends on texture preference but finer cooks faster and blends better. Garlic burns fast, add just after browning meat, not too long on heat or bitterness. Tomato sauce plus diced tomatoes bring acidity and freshness; can swap diced with crushed tomatoes if texture preferred but keep juices — flavor lives there. Water amount matters, use less for thicker sauce, add if drying out. Chipotle powder swapped for paprika for smoky heat; if spice scares you, use smoked paprika or half chipotle. Pasta shells over elbows lock sauce inside better, avoid overcooking or mush. Frozen corn lends pop and sweetness but fresh works too; canned if drained. Sharp cheddar chosen for melt and flavor contrast; mild cheese makes it boring. Parmesan or smoked cheeses work as alternatives if cheese allergies present. Always have olive oil or butter handy to finish for gloss if sauce looks dull."
instructionsNote: "Brown the beef fully to build flavor via Maillard browning; muscle fibers change, you smell that meaty caramelization. Avoid overcrowding pot or meat steams. Drain excess fat—too greasy sauce kills it. After that, adding garlic right away keeps its fragrance pure, toss in too early and it fades or bites bitter. Tomato and juices give the bulk — simmer low, uncovered to reduce liquid; don’t cover or steam develops blandness instead of thickening. Use eye and smell—simmer should have soft bubbling, tomato smell thickening, not boiling violent bubbles. Add pasta and corn at this stage; the pasta cooks in sauce flavor, stirring every few minutes prevents gluey clumps. Pasta doneness judged by chew, with firm nudge inside, not mushy. If water evaporates too fast, splash more in. Final cheese topping melts from residual heat — no extra heat needed, keeps cheese gooey. Serving fresh is best for contrast, leftovers gain depth but pasteurized cheddar may separate if reheated aggressively. Use wooden spoon or heat-proof silicone spatula to stir—metal overheats pasta, plastic safer and stops scratching the dutch oven."
tips:
- "Brown meat fully to get that Maillard crust smell - no pink left. That sizzle turning steady pop means next step. Drain fat or sauce gets greasy; don’t skip this or flavor stalls. Onions go in next; translucent, not browned, release sweetness without bite overwhelming. Garlic last of all, quick stir then off heat soon or it burns fast, turns bitter."
- "Simmer sauce uncovered till thickens; look for gentle bubbling curling around pot edges, not violent boil. Smell thickening tomato, deeper color cues done. Stir often, watch liquid level, if too dry add small water bursts, too watery, let sit longer. Chipotle hits smoky heat without paprika's sweet mildness; swap half smoked paprika if spice scares you."
- "Pasta shells trap sauce better than elbows, texture stays firm but tender. Add pasta and corn late; keep stirring every few minutes or pasta lumps. Listen for soft clinks as shells move, good sign. Cook pasta until tender but not mushy, firm bite inside, test frequently near end. Use frozen corn for sweetness; fresh or canned okay but watch moisture."
- "Cheddar cheese melts last, sprinkle while hot then wait a minute for gooey finish. Sharp cheddar cuts rich sauce, mild cheese dulls whole dish. Parmesan or smoked cheese acts different—try if allergies or change interest. If sauce looks dull, splash oil or butter at end for shine and silkiness."
- "Use wooden spoon or heat-safe silicone spatula to stir pasta, avoid metal scraping pot surface or overheating pasta. Pot size matters; overcrowd meat and it steams, no brown. Times vary by stove and pot heat retention; watch signs, smells, sounds, not just clocks."
faq:
- "q: How do I fix greasy sauce? a: Drain fat after browning beef - key step. Fat left in makes sauce slick, masks flavors. If greasy after simmer, skim off surface with spoon. Next time brown in batches if crowded pot stalls evaporation."
- "q: Can I swap pasta type? a: Yes but shells catch sauce better. Elbows work but texture differs. Rice or quinoa no—different cooking times and absorbencies. Fresh pasta cooks faster, watch closely. Adjust water amount when switching starch."
- "q: How to know when pasta is done? a: Cook covered or uncovered gives different speed. Here uncovered—stir often to stop sticking. Bite test key—firm but no crunch, not mush. Listen for soft clinks in pot. If mushy, cooking too long or too much water, reduce next batch."
- "q: How long leftovers keep? a: Store in fridge up to 3 days covered tight. Sauce thickens and flavors meld overnight, better taste but cheese separates if reheated quick or high heat. Reheat gently on stove with splash water or microwave at low power."
