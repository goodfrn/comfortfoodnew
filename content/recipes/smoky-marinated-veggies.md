ingredients:
- "3 orange bell peppers"
- "2 red bell peppers"
- "3 medium red onions, sliced in 1cm rounds"
- "2 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise, sliced 1cm thick"
- "2 medium eggplants, sliced 1cm thick"
- "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped"
- "270 ml extra virgin olive oil"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "Marinade ingredients"
- "460 ml olive oil"
- "14 garlic cloves, halved"
- "6 fresh rosemary sprigs (substitute for thyme)"
- "8 peppercorns black, whole"
- "200 ml red wine vinegar (instead of white wine vinegar)"
instructions:
- "=== Vegetables ==="
- "Heat grill to high. Place bell peppers directly on grill bars. Char skin until blackened and blistered, rotate regularly. Smell that smoky tang? When skin darkened all over—maybe 7-10 minutes—remove and place peppers in a bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let steam 20 min. Helps loosen skin; easier peeling."
- "While peppers sweat, prepare onions: thread skewers or toothpicks through loops to keep slices intact on grill. No one wants falling rings on coals."
- "Mix onions, zucchini, eggplants, chopped garlic in big bowl. Drizzle 150 ml olive oil, season with salt and pepper, toss to coat evenly. Veggies should glisten but not drenched."
- "Grill veggies over medium heat, close to grill but watch for flare-ups. Grill until tender, some grill marks, edges slightly caramelized. Flexibility in time—depends on thickness and heat. About 20 minutes. Test with fork: tender but still with bite. Let cool spread on tray so they don’t steam themselves."
- "Peel cooled peppers: skin should slip off with finger or knife tip. Remove seeds and membranes. Cut each pepper into generous strips, aim for 3 pieces each. Keep colors mixed for jars."
- "=== Marinade ==="
- "In heavy saucepan, combine olive oil, halved garlic cloves, rosemary sprigs, peppercorns. Heat slowly until small bubbles form around edges—don't let it fry or burn garlic—about 12 minutes. Garlic should be softened, slightly golden, releasing aroma but not browned."
- "Remove from heat and stir in red wine vinegar. Season with salt. Balanced acidity is key; no vinegar heaviness. Let marinade rest 5 minutes to marry."
- "=== Pack jars ==="
- "Layer veggies with contrasting colors in clean sterilized jars. Alternate peppers, onions, zucchini, eggplant. Scatter softened garlic halves, rosemary sprigs between layers."
- "Pour marinade hot over veggies, covering completely. Pull jars towards counter edge and give light taps—expels trapped air."
- "Seal jars firmly but not overtight; leave slight gap for marinade expansion as cools."
- "Let jars cool on counter until lukewarm (about 1 hour). Then refrigerate at least 24 hours, ideally 48 for flavors to meld. Check oil level before serving; top with more olive oil if needed."
- "Serve cool or room temperature. Nice with bocconcini, cherry tomatoes, grilled meats. Leftovers last up to 2 weeks refrigerated—if oil cloud or odor odd, discard. You can swap rosemary for oregano or thyme; red wine vinegar adds earthy warmth, white is sharper."
- "Vegetables must be grilled just right: too soft, mushy jarred mess; undercooked, chew battle. Take your time, watch closely. Grill marks, slight char, fragrant grill smoke are your pointers."
- "Tried plain garlic once—too sharp raw. Slow cooking garlic in oil tames bite, deepens flavor. Aroma swells kitchen; that’s the cue. Flare-ups? Move veggies and watch oil closely to avoid bitter burnt taste."
- "If no grill, roast under broiler or pan sear with grill marks using cast iron. Speeds up char but misses smoky depth. You can add smoked paprika to marinade to fake barbecue notes."
- "Keep oil quality high. Olive oil should be fruity, fresh. Cheap oil dulls vibrancy and lessens preservation."
- "Note: piercing onions with toothpicks avoids fall-apart strands and messy grill clean-up. Learned that from burnt onion disaster a few summers ago. Simple step, big payoff."
- "Final tip: let jars sit unopened in fridge at least 24 hours. Rushing kills the layered flavors, and the garlic and herbs need time to infuse properly."
introduction: "Grilling vegetables over hot coals—skin blistering, the scent sharp and earthy. Bell peppers blackened unevenly. Onion rings held together with toothpicks spun on the grill, sizzling softly. Courgettes and eggplants smoking lightly, their flesh firm but yielding. Marinating these veggies in an infused olive oil and sharp red wine vinegar mix, garlic softened gently in the warm oil, rosemary releasing piney notes. Letting it all meld in jars, colors alternating, savory scents rising. I usually swap thyme for rosemary here—more punch. Early experiments with raw garlic threw bitterness, slow cooking mellowed it. Timing always a guess, now I rely on smell, texture, visual char. This summer staple, easy kept in fridge, serves well with grilled meats or fresh bocconcini, even plain crusty bread."
ingredientsNote: "Swapped some bell peppers for orange ones to tweak sweetness; red and orange paired better in jars visually, balance sharp and sweet. Garlic doubled in marinade, split instead of whole cloves—more surface area, garlic-infused oil gold. Rosemary replaced thyme for earthier aroma; rosemary holds up better to oil. Changed white wine vinegar for red—deeper flavor, softer acidity. Important: slice veggies evenly to ensure even grilling, about 1 cm thick. Thicker means longer cook, run risk of mush. Toothpicks in onion slices keep shape. Olive oil quantity varies depending on veggie absorption, use fruity, fresh oil for best flavor and preservation. Jar sterilization critical—no funky flavors or spoilage. If short on time, quick soak in vinegar after grilling—you lose some depth but save hours."
instructionsNote: "Grilling peppers first lets their skin char and loosen for peeling. Don’t rush this resting step—trapped heat steams them perfectly. Use good, tight plastic wrap. Onion rings pierced hold shape, no messy loose bits falling through grill gaps. Toss veggies with oil and seasoning before grilling—helps with even cooking and flavor distribution; avoid over-oiling or veggies steam. Grill medium heat to get caramelization without burning. Watch for flare-ups from dripping oil—move veggies if needed. Marinade simmer low, garlic soft not browned or bitter. Add vinegar off-heat to keep aromas bright. Assemble jars alternating colors; visual matters. Hot marinade ensures better preservation and veggie soaking. Tap jars to release air bubbles and store in fridge after cooling down to room temp. Serve after 1-2 days—flavors fuse beautifully then. Reheat oil gently if solidified in fridge before serving."
tips:
- "Grill peppers direct on bars, skin blackens and blisters unevenly. Timing around 7 to 10 minutes but watch closely. Wrap right away to steam; loose skin peels easier. Don’t rush removing skin or seeds after steaming—helps strips stay intact. Piece size matters—aim for 3 strips each, mix colors in jars for visual interest."
- "Use toothpicks or skewers to thread onion rings. Keeps shape on grill so slices don’t fall apart or slip through bars. Onions burn easily; medium heat and watch flare-ups from dripping oil. Toss zucchini and eggplants with oil, salt, pepper before grilling, not too oily or they steam. Grill marks, caramelized edges tell when done, fork test for texture still with bite; not mushy."
- "Simmer marinade slowly on low heat. Garlic softening, slightly golden but no fry or brown. Aroma rising is your cue. Add vinegar off heat to keep sharpness bright without bitterness. Let rest 5 minutes so flavors marry but don’t overpower. Use fresh rosemary sprigs, firm not wilted, their needles hold up and infuse better than thyme in oil."
- "Pack jars layering contrasting colors: peppers, onions, zucchini, eggplants. Scatter softened garlic halves and rosemary sprigs between layers for aroma bursts. Pour marinade hot to cover all vegetables. Tap jars on counter to expel trapped air—helps better preservation. Don’t over-tighten lids; leave room for expansion as marinade cools."
- "After sealing, leave jars to cool on counter until lukewarm, about 1 hour. Then refrigeration at least 24 hours, ideally 48, unlocks mellow deep flavors. Check oil level before serving; top with more olive oil if absorbed. If no grill, broiler or cast iron grill pan can sub but flavor differs. Add smoked paprika in marinade if missing smoky notes. Olive oil quality crucial; cheap oil dulls flavor and reduces shelf life."
faq:
- "q: How to tell when peppers are ready to peel? a: Look for deep black blistering all over skin, uneven char helps loosen. Steam with tight plastic wrap 20 minutes after grilling. Skin slips off easy. Don’t rush or press too hard to peel raw or still hot. Timing varies by grill heat but usually 7 to 10 minutes. Steam rest step critical."
- "q: Can I substitute herbs in marinade? a: Rosemary best holds up in oil, thyme is softer, oregano works but less pine aroma. Fresh sprigs only, dried don’t infuse well here. Also, double garlic cloves for stronger notes but cook slowly, no browning. Vinegar swap ok; red wine vinegar mellower, white sharper. Adjust acidity by tasting marinade before pouring."
- "q: Why do my grilled veggies turn mushy sometimes? a: Cut thickness uneven or grill too long. Use about 1 cm slices, medium heat only. Don’t over oil or veggies steam themselves covered. Flip carefully, watch flare-ups. Timing flexible but texture should be tender with slight bite. Test with fork or taste frequently. Cooling on tray before jar stops soggy steam effect."
- "q: How long do marinated veggies last stored? a: Refrigerate sealed jars minimum 24 hours for flavors but can keep 2 weeks max, check oil clarity and odor regularly. If oil clouds or smells off discard. Room temp risky, better fridge. Can add more olive oil topping to cover if level drops. Sterilize jars thoroughly to avoid spoilage. Refrigerated and sealed best option."
