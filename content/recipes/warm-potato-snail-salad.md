ingredients:
- "9 small potatoes grelots"
- "85 g maitake mushrooms, trimmed, quartered"
- "30 ml walnut oil"
- "20 ml balsamic vinegar"
- "2 shallots, minced"
- "2 cloves garlic, minced"
- "2 cans of escargots, 115 g each, rinsed and drained"
- "20 ml mayonnaise"
- "15 ml Greek yogurt"
- "5 ml Dijon mustard"
- "25 ml chopped tarragon"
- "25 g watercress"
instructions:
- "1. Place the potatoes in a pot. Cover with salted cold water. Bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are fork-tender, about 40 minutes. Drain, cool slightly, then cut in halves. Set aside."
- "2. Heat walnut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add maitake mushrooms, season with salt and pepper. Cook until browned, about 7 minutes. Pour in balsamic vinegar to deglaze, cook 1 minute."
- "3. Toss in shallots, sauté 3 minutes stirring constantly. Add garlic and escargots, cook another 3 minutes stirring gently. Season with salt and pepper."
- "4. Whisk together mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, and Dijon mustard in a large bowl. Add the potatoes and mushroom-escargot mix. Stir well. Adjust seasoning."
- "5. Fold in tarragon and watercress gently. Serve warm or at room temperature."
introduction: "Potatoes sliced mid-cook. Mushrooms get earthy and firm. Different oil, nuts whisper walnut instead of olive. Vinegar shifts to balsamic, sweeter, deeper. Garlic steps back, shallot takes the lead. Escargots intact, waiting in the pan. Mayonnaise drops a bit, tang from Greek yogurt kicks in. Tarragon, fresh and sharp, swaps in for cerfeuil. Watercress holds green, peppery freshness. Warm or cool. Textural play, herbiness. Sharp with cream, mousse meets earth. French salad gets remixed, timing pushed slight. Cooking turns bloom, flavors mingle under heat. A bit longer on potatoes, mushrooms slow dance. No waiting. Fork tender, bite crisp. Salty, creamy, acidic. "
ingredientsNote: "Potatoes small, uniform, to cook evenly in salted water preventing blandness. Maitake chosen for a firmer texture and smoky undertone, alternate to shiitake’s woodsy depth. Walnut oil replaces olive for subtle nutty profile, careful not to overpower delicate snail flavor. Balsamic vinegar softens acidity with mild sweetness, balancing the dish differently than sharper xérès or red wine. Shallots replace garlic entirely or minimize it for gentler aromatic lift. Mayonnaise cut back, Greek yogurt adds brightness and tang, lowers fat slightly. Tarragon's licorice notes contrast cerfeuil's mild celery flavor but keep fresh herb character. Watercress final touch, adds crunch and peppery punch to marry potato softness. Escargots rinsed to remove brine, crucial to preserve mild taste."
instructionsNote: "Start with slow boiling potatoes in salted water, not rushed, 35-40 minutes to ensure tender but intact halves. Mushroom sauté time extended for deeper caramelization, careful not to burn. Deglaze with balsamic vinegar, letting sugars help lift cooked bits. Shallots go in early enough to soften but not brown, garlic timing reduced for subtle hints. Escargots added last, brief heating to warm but not rubbery. Mix mayo, yogurt, mustard thoroughly for a smooth binder. Fold in cooked ingredients gently, avoiding potato mashing. Adjust salt and pepper incrementally. Final step folding in herbs and watercress leaves, tossing light so textures hold through serving. Serve slightly warm or room temp, flavors meld yet retain freshness. Timing critical to balance tenderness and avoid overcooking seafood component."
tips:
- "Potatoes uniform size, small. Salted water crucial for flavor. Boil gently. 35-40 minutes, then test tenderness. Cut halves. Keep skins intact, retains moisture."
- "Maitake mushrooms add earthy flavors. Trim well. Quarter them for best texture. Sauté until browned. Watch carefully. Avoid burning. Perfect caramelization is key."
- "Balsamic vinegar softens the salad's acidity. Coat mushrooms well. Deglaze pan. Lift flavor stuck at the bottom. One minute maximum, don’t overdo it."
- "Mix yogurt, mayonnaise, mustard thoroughly. Smooth emulsification needed. Binding crucial for consistency. Adjust amount based on taste. Light and creamy finish desired."
- "Watercress adds peppery freshness. Fold in gently last. Preserve texture. Key here, not mashing potatoes. Think balance. Warm or room temperature, both work."

- "q: Can I use other mushrooms? a: Yes, shiitake ok. Cremini too, different flavor. Textures vary. Adjust cooking time as needed. Keep an eye."
- "q: Storage suggestions? a: Store in airtight containers. Refrigerate. Best within two days. Reheat, but quick. Cold salad option also possible. Just adjust dressing."
