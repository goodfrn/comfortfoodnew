slug: "cinnamon-crunch-cookies"
description: "Big chewy cookies packed with crushed cinnamon cereal and white chocolate chips. Cream cheese frosting slathers the top, sprinkled with more cereal and cinnamon-sugar. The dough uses a mix of all-purpose and cake flours for texture and white chocolate pudding powder keeps them soft. Baking at a higher heat crisps edges while inside stays tender. The cereal crush gives an unexpected crunch punch. Uses classic baking levers—baking soda and powder—plus cornstarch for tenderness. Sweet cinnamon-sugar coats dough balls, caramelizing lightly in oven. Frost with a butter-cream cheese mix to balance sweet and tangy. Probably my third batch tweaking times and ratios for balance between chew and crumble."

ingredients:
- "2 cups cinnamon toast crunch cereal, divided"
- "1 ½ cups all-purpose flour"
- "1 cup cake flour"
- "1 packet white chocolate instant pudding mix"
- "½ cup cornstarch"
- "½ tsp baking soda"
- "½ tsp baking powder"
- "1 tbsp ground cinnamon"
- "½ tsp salt"
- "1 cup unsalted butter, softened"
- "¾ cup granulated sugar"
- "¾ cup packed light brown sugar"
- "2 large eggs"
- "1 tbsp vanilla extract"
- "1 ½ cups white chocolate chips"
- "½ cup granulated sugar mixed with 1 tbsp ground cinnamon (for rolling)"
- "4 oz cream cheese, softened"
- "4 tbsp unsalted butter, softened"
- "1 ½ cups powdered sugar"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "¼ tsp salt"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 395°F. Higher temp crisps edges carefully without drying center."
- "In food processor, blitz 2 cups cereal until crumbly but not powdery, around 12-15 seconds. You want texture visible."
- "Mix together all flours, pudding mix, cornstarch, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in large bowl. Whisk well so dry stuff is uniform."
- "Using paddle attachment on stand mixer, cream softened butter with both sugars on medium speed 3-4 min. Should lighten and fluff enough to hold peaks but avoid overbeating or it'll be dry."
- "Add eggs one at a time, then vanilla extract. Mix just to blend; overdoing toughens dough."
- "Lower speed; add dry ingredients gradually quarter cup at a time. Scrape sides after each addition. Fold in crushed cereal and white chocolate chips until just combined. Don’t overmix; dough feels dense but pliable."
- "Divide dough into 6 large balls. Size matters here for baking time. Less or more alters texture."
- "Roll dough balls in cinnamon-sugar mix thoroughly so coating sticks. Gives brown sugar crackle in oven."
- "Place on baking sheet lined with silicone mat or parchment spaced apart. Bake 11-13 minutes watching edges turn golden brown and centers set but not hard."
- "While baking, whip cream cheese and butter with hand mixer till creamy. Add powdered sugar in increments blending well. Stir in vanilla and salt. Frosting should be thick but spreadable; add sugar if too loose."
- "Put remaining 1 cup cereal in sealable bag and bruise to broken bits but some chunks remain. Adds crunch topping."
- "Once cookies are out, allow 15-minute rest on sheet to firm. Then transfer to rack to cool fully. Cooling crucial for frosting hold."
- "Spread frosting on cookies. Sprinkle crushed cereal on top along with remaining cinnamon-sugar mix. Adds aroma and layered texture."
- "Enjoy immediately or store airtight. Frosted cookies soften slightly but crumbs stay pleasant."
introduction: "Crunch. Sweet, warm cinnamon aroma fills the kitchen. You’re here for a cookie that isn’t shy—big, soft with crispy edges and unexpected crunch of cereal baked in and scattered on top. The slight tang from cream cheese frosting cuts through the sugary rush. I’ve made these twice adjusting baking temperature, swapping some flours, and playing with how much cereal crush to get that mouthfeel right—the kind that snaps then melts. The pudding powder keeps these surprisingly soft after cooling, avoid skipping it. If you decide to use a different cereal, watch texture and sweetness, some add bitter notes or moisten too much. Seriously, watch those browned edges, they go fast once they start."
ingredientsNote: "Swapping cake flour for all-purpose is a key move to lighten the crumb—you want tooth but not dense brick. Instant pudding mix adds moisture retention without sogginess; vanilla flavor works best. If you lack cornstarch, use arrowroot or tapioca but note texture impact. For butter, salted is fine; just skip added salt in dry ingredients or adjust accordingly. White chocolate chips can be bittersweet if preferred; adds complexity. Vanilla quality matters here—I use pure Madagascar extract. For cinnamon sugar, freshly ground cinnamon delivers better aroma. If no cinnamon toast crunch, any sweet cinnamon square cereal can replace but test sugar levels. Rolling dough in sugar mix before baking keeps edges glossy and flavorful, don’t skip."
instructionsNote: "Creaming butter and sugars aerates dough enabling rise; rush this and you get heavy cookies. Add dry ingredients low and slow to avoid flour clouds and tough spots—scraping bowl sides frequently makes uniform dough. Crushing cereal too fine turns dough gritty; keep some clumps for texture. Don’t overbake; cookie edges should be golden with soft centers that firm on cooling; pressing lightly reveals spring back not raw dough. Frosting consistency is key—too thin slides off, too stiff tears cookies. Cool cookies completely before frosting or mix melts and gets greasy. Crushing cereal for topping just before serving preserves crunch. Storing leftover cookies in airtight containers maintains chewiness but frostings like this refrigerate best; bring cookies to room temp before eating to allow flavors to bloom."
tips:
- "Use mix of all-purpose and cake flour for chew with light crumb. Cake flour means less protein, softer texture. Don’t skip pudding powder; it keeps moisture locked in without sogginess. If lacking pudding, try vanilla instant or leave it out but expect drier bite."
- "Butter softened but cool, not melted. Cream sugars and butter med speed long enough to fluff but stop before dry or crumbly. Overbeating pulls moisture out. Watch texture not time. Scrape bowl sides often to keep uniform mix."
- "Add dry ingredients slowly, quarter cup at a time. Keeps flour from flying everywhere, prevents overworking dough. Holds air in mix. Folding in crushed cereal with gentle strokes stops grit; some clumps stay for crunch contrast."
- "Roll dough balls thick in cinnamon-sugar mix. Coating sticks better than sprinkling later. Provides crackled sheen during baking and deep caramel aroma. If sugar mix is too loose, cookies turn dull or dry on edges."
- "Baking temps high at 395°F crisps edges quick while keeping centers soft. Watch closely last 2 minutes to avoid burnt sugar scent. Edges should turn golden brown, centers set visibly but still soft to touch. Cooling firms shape and prevents sogginess under frosting."
faq:
- "q: What cereal substitutes work? a: Use any sweet cinnamon square cereal. Watch sugar levels; cakier cereals moisten dough, crunchier dry out. Bitterness from some cereals changes taste. Adjust sugar accordingly. Texture varies with crush size."
- "q: Can I use salted butter? a: Yes but reduce salt in dry mix or skip added salt. Salted butter varies brand to brand; may need small tweaks. Taste dough before baking if unsure. Balances sweet with slight savory."
- "q: Dough feels too dry or crumbly? a: Add eggs one at a time, maybe extra yolk. Overbeating butter can cause dryness. Softened butter key. Pudding mix holds moisture, skip if drying out. Room temp ingredients help dough hold better."
- "q: How to store finished cookies? a: Airtight container room temp fine for day or two. Refrigerate for longer but bring to room temp before eating; frosting firms up cold, softens when warm. Freeze unbaked dough or fully cooled frosted cookies wrapped well, thaw gently."
