ingredients:
- "350 ml braised pork in chipotle sauce"
- "5 green onions cut into 6 cm pieces"
- "4 whole wheat tortillas"
- "20 ml avocado oil"
- "100 g shredded Monterey Jack cheese"
- "75 g diced roasted poblano peppers"
- "15 g fresh cilantro leaves"
instructions:
- "Warm pork gently with sauce in a small pot. Shred meat with fork. Simmer on medium-low until sauce coats pork well. Remove from heat."
- "Sauté green onions dry in a large skillet over medium heat until they begin to char. Set aside on a plate."
- "Lightly oil two pans with avocado oil, heat medium."
- "Brush one side of each tortilla with oil. Flip. Spread 125 ml pork on half of each tortilla. Layer green onions, poblano peppers, Monterey Jack, and cilantro on pork. Fold tortillas over filling."
- "Cook quesadillas 3-4 minutes each side until golden and cheese melts. Cut in half if preferred. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Braised pork in chipotle sauce. The spicy, smoky meat breaks apart with a fork. Layer it with diced roasted poblano instead of corn for extra smoky depth. Green onions charred just enough to bring out sweetness and texture. Melt Monterey Jack cheese in the swirl of flavors. Tortillas brushed with avocado oil instead of olive for a subtle nuttiness and crisp edge. Quick pan cooking, 7 minutes tops each side for crunch and gooey insides. Cilantro thrown in fresh at the end. No time wasted. Mex-inspired but different. Just meat, veggies, cheese, and tortillas. Folded like a half moon and browned. Eat hot. Bite into a mess of sauce and melty cheese with herb freshness. Minimal fuss but maximal flavor complexity."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust pork quantity slightly downward to avoid overload, or up for bigger portions. Green onions should be fresh with firm stalks for ideal texture when charred lightly. Tortillas—whole wheat offers a more robust flavor; however, corn tortillas can substitute for gluten sensitivity. Avocado oil replaces olive oil for smoke point and delicate flavor profile. Monterey Jack chosen over cheddar to reduce sharpness and promote creamy meltiness. Poblano peppers add mild smoky heat replacing sweet frozen corn kernels. Fresh cilantro staple for vibrant finish. All measured roughly to keep ease and balance flavor contrasts."
instructionsNote: "Start slow heating pork to avoid drying. Shred pork tender but not mushy, sauce reduction thickens flavor. Green onions dry sauté develops sweetness and slight bitterness, avoid burning. Use two pans ready to speed cooking and even crisping. Brush oil on tortillas for crunch without excess grease. Folding holds ingredients neatly, avoids spill. Cooking time slightly extended over original recipe for better cheese melt and tortilla crunch. Flip carefully midway. Serve hot to preserve textures and flavors. Optionally cut quesadillas in halves for easy sharing or plating. Serve fresh; reheating alters texture negatively."
tips:
- "When shredding pork, do it gently. Avoid mushy. You want texture. The right sauce coating makes a difference too. Adjust accordingly. Don't overdo the heat."
- "Green onions char well with dry sauté method. Aim for a little bit of charring. Sweetness comes from doing it right. Avoid burning. When done, set aside. It adds great pop."
- "Using multiple pans? Effective method. Speeds cooking, crispy outcome. Oil considerations are key. Brush tortillas lightly. Keeps them from being greasy. Oil for crunch."
- "Layering with poblano? Smart choice. Adds mild smoky depth. Swap out corn kernels. Adjust quantity if needed. Fresh cilantro right at the end is crucial. Brightens up!"
- "Cooking time is critical. 3 to 4 minutes each side should suffice. Watch for golden brown. Melty cheese means perfect quesadilla. Cut for easier sharing or plating."
