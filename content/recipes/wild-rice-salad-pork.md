title: "Wild Rice Salad with Grilled Pork"
slug: "wild-rice-salad-pork"
description: "Grilled pork chops sliced thin, tossed with wild rice cooked until tender, mixed with finely sliced bell peppers and green onions. Roasted peanuts swapped for toasted sesame seeds, adding crunch and a nutty aroma. Dressing of mirin, rice vinegar, and tamari delivers balanced tang and umami. Finished with fresh cilantro instead of parsley and a handful of baby spinach leaves replacing arugula for a milder bite. Simple, adaptable. Cook rice until grains burst but keep slight chew. Grill pork hot until char marks blossom and juices run clear. Toss warm components quickly with dressing, then chill or serve near room temp. Sesame seeds add subtle depth and crunch over peanuts, less allergenic and a twist I picked up experimenting with Asian salads. Hands-on with texture and aroma. A neat way to dress leftovers."

ingredients:
- "140 ml wild rice"
- "2 boneless pork chops about 2 cm thick"
- "1 red bell pepper finely sliced"
- "1 yellow bell pepper finely sliced"
- "3 green onions sliced thin"
- "1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds"
- "2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro"
- "2 tablespoons rice vinegar"
- "2 tablespoons tamari sauce"
- "2 tablespoons mirin"
- "1 1/2 cups baby spinach leaves"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Rinse wild rice under cold water. Place in pot, cover with salted water, about 1 inch above rice. Bring to boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook gently uncovered for 45 to 60 minutes — look for grains bursting open, but still some bite inside. Drain; spread on tray to cool quickly to avoid mush."
- "Brush pork chops with oil, sprinkle salt and pepper. Preheat grill pan or outdoor grill until hot, a moment away from smoking. Sear chops about 4 minutes per side until dark grill lines form and meat is firm with slight spring. The juices should run clear when pressed in thickest area. Rest 5 to 10 minutes under foil to redistribute juices. Slice thinly against grain."
- "In large bowl toss warm rice with red and yellow peppers, green onions, cilantro, toasted sesame seeds. Whisk rice vinegar, tamari, and mirin; drizzle over rice mixture. Stir gently but thoroughly. Taste for seasoning; add salt if needed — mirin adds sweetness, so balance with sharp vinegar."
- "Add sliced pork to bowl, fold gently to combine. Let salad rest 10 minutes to marry flavors, or chill for a colder salad with firmer textures."
- "Just before serving, add baby spinach leaves on top or fold quickly, so they stay bright green and crisp, not wilted. Serve at room temp or straight from fridge. The interplay between tender rice, smoky pork, crunchy seeds, and crisp peppers is key."
introduction: "Wild rice. Not your average grain. Needs slow coaxing—patience, but worth it. Grain bursts, chewy but soft. Pork chops, thick yet quick on the grill; that crisp sear, char giving smoky perfume fills the kitchen. Peppers sliced thin, sharp colors pop against grain's earthiness. Subbing peanuts for sesame seeds cuts risk for allergies, but adds nutty crackle. Cilantro brings fresh brightness, swaps that familiar parsley for a more assertive note. Spinach, not arugula—softer, less peppery; takes the heat better when tossed near end. Dressing’s simple, three parts mirin, vinegar, tamari; all balancing sweet and savory in harmony. I’ve tried other combos—oil heavy, too salty—but this light shake drenching, quick blend? Works with the tender pork resting. Serve it room temp or chilled when you want something easy, full of layers. Great for leftovers too. A salad that feels like an entree."
ingredientsNote: "Wild rice takes time; rinse well to get rid of grit and cloudy starch. Use more water than for plain rice; grains need space to swell and burst. Swap with brown rice if pressed, but texture’s different—firmer, less chewy. Pork chops: thick but not too thick, remember. Thin cooks faster but won’t get that char outside with pink inside. Oil chops lightly so seasoning sticks, and grill marks seal in juice. Toast and crush sesame seeds yourself for aromatic freshness—not store-bought pre-toasted. Cilantro here instead of parsley brings citrusy punch, perfect with Asian dressing. Bell peppers—go for vibrant colors, crisp, and fresh. Spinach replaces arugula for milder bite; if wilted, it dulls the salad so add last minute. Tamari instead of soy sauce for better flavor and gluten-free option. Mirin adds subtle sweetness without syrup edges; if missing, blend a bit of honey with rice vinegar."
instructionsNote: "Rice cooking is about watching, not clock. Stir once or twice to prevent sticking. Grains popping open signals softness; if too firm, continue simmering with lid partially ajar. Drain well, pat dry—waterlogged rice kills texture. Pork chops get hot grill or pan—oil prevents sticking and helps char. Sear until meat firms up, juices run clear when probed; don’t overcook or it’s dry sawdust. Let them rest, an often skipped moment that redistributes moisture inside. Slice against grain for tenderness. Mixing: toss warm rice, veggies, and dressing to meld flavors without wilting. Light dressing here—too much hides ingredients’ character. Fold in pork gently; it’s fragile once sliced. Spinach tossed at last to maintain crisp edges and color vibrance. Salad tastes different warm or cold; warm brings out mirin aroma while cold tightens textures. If in a pinch, cooked rice can be reheated with tiny splash of water to revive softness before dressing. Cleanup trick: soak bowl immediately to prevent rice sticking."
tips:
- "Rinse wild rice thoroughly. Grit sticks if skipped. Use plenty water—an inch above rice. Simmer uncovered mostly; spot grains bursting open for doneness. Don’t rush or mush will kill texture. A little chew stays. Drain immediately; spread on tray cool fast. Cooling stops overcooking and clumping."
- "Oil pork lightly before grilling. Enough for seasoning to cling and stop sticking. Grill hot, not medium. Watch smoke; sear forms fast grill lines. Flip quickly. Juices running clear means done inside. Rest under foil 5 to 10 minutes. Don’t skip resting. It redistributes moisture, keeps pork juicy. Slice against grain thin for softness."
- "Dress rice while warm but not hot. Toss quickly with vinegar, tamari, mirin. Whisk vinaigrette separately for even mix, then drizzle slowly. Add salt last. Mirin sweetness soft but can mask otherwise. Balance the sharp vinegar punch or dressing falls flat. Sesame seeds should be freshly toasted and crushed not store pre-toasted for aroma."
- "Veggies sliced thin keep crunch and brightness. Bell peppers—red, yellow for color pop and sharp fresh notes. Green onions add mild sharpness but not overpower. Spinach replaces arugula for softer bite and less pepper heat. Fold spinach last or leaves wilt, dulling overall texture and color vibrance. Toss carefully not to bruise."
- "If rice too firm after timed cook, give 10 more minutes simmer with lid partially open. Check by bite, not clock. For leftovers, reheat cooked rice with splash water to soften, toss with dressing freshly. Pork reheats best gently, avoid drying. Salad works room temp or cold. Toast sesame seeds yourself often. Adds that aromatic nuttiness missing in store-bought."
faq:
- "q: How do I know when wild rice is cooked? a: Grains start popping open, some burst spots. Still slight chew inside. If too hard, simmer more. Don’t rely on timers alone. Drain fast once done; mush ruins texture."
- "q: Can I substitute pork chops? a: Yes, chicken breast or thighs work but less smoky flavor. Grill same way, watch cook time. Tofu or tempeh for veg option. Adjust marinate time for alternatives."
- "q: My pork chops dry out. What went wrong? a: Usually grill too low or overcooked. Need high heat sear fast. Rest after grilling traps juices. Slice thin against grain. Avoid flipping too much. Oil keeps surface from sticking and drying."
- "q: How long can I store leftovers? a: Couple days in airtight container fridge. Spinach wilts fast, add fresh next day if possible. Reheat gently or eat cold. Dressing may settle; toss before serving."
