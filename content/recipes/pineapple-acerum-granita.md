ingredients:
- "400 g (about 2 1/2 cups) pineapple chunks very ripe, peeled"
- "200 ml (about 3/4 cup plus 1 tbsp) water"
- "110 g (1/2 cup) granulated sugar"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp) white acerum maple spirit substitute with aged rum or blanco tequila"
- "1 medium lime, zest finely grated plus extra for garnish"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) fresh lime juice"
- "1/2 vanilla bean, scraped or 2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) vanilla extract"
- "250 ml (1 cup) heavy cream (35%), cold for whipping"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) sugar"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) white acerum spirit or same substitute as above"
- "25 g (2 tbsp) toasted unsweetened coconut flakes, roughly chopped replacing shredded sweetened coconut"
instructions:
- "=== Granita base ==="
- "Pulse pineapple with water, sugar, lime zest and juice, vanilla in blender til insanely smooth—no chunks should remain. Should smell sharply sweet, fresh citrus punch mingling with vanilla warmth. Stir in spirit gently—this cuts through the chill for an adult kick; no need for excess, else too much ice melt risk."
- "Pour this mix into a shallow metal or glass pan, about 20 cm square. Cover loosely; place in freezer. Freeze for around 7 hours, but watch closely past 6. When edges solid and center mostly firm but not glass hard, it’s ready for texture break-up."
- "=== Texturing granita ==="
- "Take out pan; grab sturdy fork. Scrape surface fervently to fragment icy sheet into crystals. Important: not pulverized snow, but coarse grains—grainy, fluffy, sparkling crystals. Return to freezer uncovered. Chop again every 45 minutes twice if possible. This prevents clumping, gives that snappy crunch loud on the teeth. Freeze no more than 8 hours max or ice turns dense and dull."
- "=== Whipped cream topping ==="
- "Using a cold bowl and chilled beaters—vital for volume—whip cream with sugar until soft peaks. Add spirit steadily as you continue; brisk whipping will firm peaks up again but now with an aroma lift and gentle boozy bite that melds with granita. Avoid overwhipping; turn from fluffy to butter quick."
- "Keep chilled until serving time. If cream softens, a quick whip rescue. Sub: coconut cream for dairy-free, but beware heavier mouthfeel and less stability."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Before serving, freeze 8 glasses or small dessert bowls minimum 20 minutes; icy serveware prolongs granita’s crunch and creaminess contrast. Spoon about 125 ml (1/2 cup) granita per glass. Top each with a generous dollop of spirit-infused whipped cream."
- "Sprinkle toasted coconut flakes on cream for that sweet roasted note and crunch. Finish with a pinch of lime zest atop; aroma bursts awake right before tasting."
- "Serve immediately. Granita melts quickly once out; timing key. Leftovers: store in airtight container, stir before scattering into glasses again."
- "=== Tips and substitutions ==="
- "Pineapple ripeness affects sweetness and acidity; adjust sugar down if mango used instead or if using canned juice (reduce water accordingly). Spirit optional but highly recommended for cutting ice hardness and layering flavor."
- "If no vanilla bean, use good quality extract and reduce lime zest slightly to avoid flavor clash."
- "Toasted coconut here chosen over sweetened shredded; prevents overly sugary finish. Use dry pan and sprinkle coconut to avoid burning!"
- "Freezing pan choice: metal freezes faster, aids crystal formation. Glass is fine but longer freeze time needed."
- "Don’t skip texture breaking steps or granita becomes an icy block, ruining mouthfeel."
- "Whipping cream tips: warm cream won’t whip well. Rest in fridge beforehand. Use chilled tools."
- "Granita texture clues: stir at semi-solid phase, when edges forming but center still yielding. Avoid full freeze solid as granita texture suffers."
introduction: "Start with a punch of sun-soaked pineapple, fading into tangy lime zest sharp enough to wake you up mid-bite. I’ve fiddled with granitas too watery, too sweet, or just icy slabs. This one? Hits that perfect crystal bite. Spirit isn't just a party trick—slows ice from solidifying like concrete. Vanilla bean over extract if you got time—adds that floral note tying tropical with maple. Whip cream becomes more than fluffy topping here; with a shot of spirit, it sings alongside shards of cold pineapple. Toasted coconut—not the sugary kind—is my final nod to tropical crunch. Beyond the obvious sweetness, the crunch, the chill, it plays with temperature and texture so you can almost taste the island breeze. Chill glasses, timing scrapes, all matter. Not just spoon and freeze recipe but an exercise in patience and feel."
ingredientsNote: "Pineapple ripeness can vary wildly, so watch sugar levels. If it’s super ripe, cut back on sweetener. Acerum spirit is key here but can swap with spiced rum or blanco tequila for variation—just don’t skip alcohol entirely or granita textures get too hard and icy. Lime zest adds aroma; keep finely grated for best spread. Vanilla bean scraping is worth extra effort; if using extract, add it last after blending. For the topping, heavy cream whipped cold is essential for volume; a quick pour of spirit keeps it lively, but too much? Cream breaks, no fun. Toasted coconut replaces sweetened strands—gives crispness without cloying your palate. Keep all ingredients chilled where possible; it affects final texture and whip stability. Water is adjusted slightly down here to keep granita denser, less diluted. Use shallow pan for quicker freezing and better texture."
instructionsNote: "Blending until completely smooth matters—don’t blitz briefly or you’ll have pineapple chunks sinking or uneven texture when frozen. After pouring in pan, wait until edges are firm but center yields under finger; key moment for scraping. Use a fork, not spoon. Scraping brings granulated texture, fragile and ethereal. Return to freezer uncovered to dry out surface. Repeated scrapes every 40-50 minutes turn ice into proper granita—not just frozen pineapple soup. Whip cream with sugar at soft peak before adding spirit gradually, whipping to firm peaks again; this helps cream incorporate alcohol without breaking. Serve granita in frozen glasses for longer chill; no lazy room temp or it melts fast. Toast coconut in dry pan over medium heat, watch closely—aroma will jump, color golden brown; remove immediately to prevent bitterness. Timing counts in frozen desserts; notes adjusted by a few minutes to reflect real kitchen rhythm, but visual and tactile cues trump timers. Experience beats stopwatch."
tips:
- "Pineapple ripeness swings sugar levels wide. Adjust granulated sugar down if extra sweet. I’ve seen granita turn soggy when sugar was too high. Use 400 g ripe chunks but check juiciness first; watery fruit kills texture crispness fast. Water quantity tweak depends too - less if canned juice used. Acerum or spiced rum substitutes work but excess alcohol kills freeze; measure carefully. Zest lime finely, mix in blender dry ends clump. Vanilla bean scraping better than extract; insert later after blender stops. Pure vanilla smell signals done blending - don’t blitz briefly or chunks remain. Keep everything chilled especially cream and utensils before whipping; cold means volume."
- "Scraping granita surface essential once edges firm but center yields under finger. Use fork not spoon, hard strokes to break icy sheet into coarse grain crystals not powder. Scrape every 40-50 mins for max crunch; skip and get solid ice block. Surface should sparkle like crushed gems. Uncovered in freezer helps dry surface, prevents dense lumps. Frozen metal pan freezes faster, aids sharper crystals but glass fine with longer freeze. Texture cues over timers: edges solid, center jiggles slightly - that’s scraping time. Not all freezers equal - watch ice don’t rely on hours."
- "Whip cream cold; room temp cream collapses too fast. Soft peaks first with sugar then add spirit steadily - too much breaks it quickly. Use 15 ml acerum or substitute. Whipping spirit in wakes aroma but balance key. Peaks firm but still light; stop before shiny buttery texture forms. Cream aroma lifts granita bite, boozy hints melt slow on tongue. Can swap coconut cream for dairy-free but texture heavier, volume less. Keep whipped cream chilled until serving. Quick re-whip possible if cream softens but avoid multiple cycles."
- "Freezing glassware prolongs texture contrast on serving. Minimum 20 minutes in freezer or more if possible. Granita melts fast once out; icy serveware holds temperature. Spoon about 125 ml granita per glass. Top with spirit-infused whipped cream dollop, finish with toasted coconut flakes. Toast coconut in dry pan over medium until golden brown, aroma jump is key - watch closely. Avoid burning, it turns bitter fast. Sprinkle lime zest last for aroma bursts just before tasting. Leftovers store airtight; stir before re-serving."
- "Spirit impacts granita hardness and flavor layering. Skip it and get brick-like ice texture. Sub aged spiced rum or blanco tequila but measure same volume or adjust water less. Lime zest aromatic oils volatile; finely grated, add after fruit blend stops. If no vanilla bean, reduce zest to avoid clash. Granita texture final result depends on patient scraping and freezing cycles. Don’t rush or freeze solid solid. Chill cream and tools beforehand. Pan choice, freezing temp, fruit ripeness all play. Watch texture cues - semi-solid phase best for scraping not frozen hard or soupy soft."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid icy block granita? a: Key is scraping. When edges firm but center soft enough, fork scrape to break ice crystals. Repeat scraping twice or thrice every 40-50 mins. No cover during scraping lets surface dry, stops lumping. Overfreezing or skipping scrapes leads to dense block. Watch texture not clock."
- "q: Can I substitute spirit? a: Yes. Same amount of aged spiced rum or blanco tequila works well. Too much alcohol melts ice too fast, so measure precisely. No alcohol means harder, less scoopable granita; sugar helps but not the same. Spirit adds subtle warmth and flavor layers."
- "q: Why doesn’t cream whip well? a: Cream must be cold and fresh. Warm cream won’t hold volume. Chill bowl and beaters before whipping. Overwhipping turns cream buttery fast; add spirit slowly at soft peak to keep structure. Coconut cream swap heavier and whips less volume."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Airtight container best. Stir before scooping again to loosen ice. Freeze cold but don’t freeze solid or long periods, or ice hardens too much. Re-scoop into chilled glasses right before serving to re-activate texture contrast."
