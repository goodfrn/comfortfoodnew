Smoke from the grill meets the creamy cheese, smoky fruit, and tart-sweet tomatoes cooked down to a tender collapse in parchment packets. A hint of spice from smoked paprika replaces piment d’Espelette. White balsamic vinegar swapped for aged sherry vinegar brings a nutty tang. Served with crisp crostini toasted with garlic and rosemary. Balanced acidity, smoky-sweetness, creamy texture, and a fresh herbal kick. A mix of sweet, tart, smoky, creamy, and crunchy--a game changer on the patio or anytime."

ingredients:
- "=== Confit Cherry Tomatoes ==="
- "200 g (1 1/3 cup) cherry tomatoes halved"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) extra-virgin olive oil"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) aged sherry vinegar"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) sea salt"
- "1 ml (1/4 tsp) smoked paprika"
- ""
- "=== Burrata and Peaches ==="
- "3 medium peaches pitted and quartered"
- "35 ml (2 1/3 tbsp) extra-virgin olive oil"
- "1 burrata ball (200 g), drained and room temp"
- "20 ml (1 1/3 tbsp) wildflower honey"
- "Fresh basil leaves to taste"
- "Fleur de sel or flaky sea salt"
- "Black pepper freshly ground"
- "Sliced baguette or country bread, toasted with garlic and rosemary"
instructions:
- "=== Confit Cherry Tomatoes ==="
- "Heat grill to medium-low. Oil grates with paper towel soaked in olive oil, use tongs, not a brush. Avoid sticking, avoid flare-ups. Toss tomatoes in bowl with oil, sherry vinegar, maple syrup, salt, smoked paprika. Let sit 20 minutes. Drain thoroughly, reserve liquid for salad dressing or vinaigrette."
- "Make a double-layer foil packet: bottom layer heavy-duty foil, top layer parchment. Place tomatoes in center, fold edges tight, seam up. Place on grill, indirect heat area is better; cook 12-15 minutes. Important to avoid charring; tomatoes should just start shrinking, soft but intact. Listen for gentle sizzle, no roar."
- "Remove from grill. Let cool a few minutes before opening. Steam escapes, tomatoes slightly sticky and richly aromatic."
- ""
- "=== Burrata and Peaches ==="
- "Brush peach quarters with 20 ml olive oil evenly. Grill on direct heat. Listen for gentle crackle. About 4-6 minutes total, flipping halfway. Look for caramelized grill marks and fruit just softening but not mushy. If peaches start oozing, you waited too long."
- "Slice burrata in half carefully, expose creamy inside. It’s soft, so cut on plate to catch any liquid inside cheese’s pouch. Place halves on serving dish."
- "Nestle warm tomatoes and peaches around, pour remaining oil from peaches plus 20 ml honey over everything. Honey cuts acidity, helps counterbalance smoky, acidic notes."
- "Scatter torn basil leaves freely. Season final plate with flaky salt and freshly cracked pepper. Serve immediately. Use toasted bread rubbed with garlic clove and lightly sprinkled rosemary. Holds up well to juices, a must-do contrast."
- ""
- "=== Notes and Kitchen Tips ==="
- "I swapped piment d’Espelette for smoked paprika for that warm smoky warmth without heat overload. Sherry vinegar added a deeper punch than balsamic white could. Maple syrup thickens confit glaze better than honey alone. I like more peaches than original, because fruit grills fast and imparts smoky sweetness that peppers tomato softness."
- "If you don’t have grill, oven broiler works fine—watchtime carefully."
- "Don’t overcrowd foil packets to ensure even cooking. No watery mess."
- "Burrata temperature matters: too cold, flavor muted; too soft, messy. Let it sit 30 min at room temp."
- "Use ripe peaches that still hold shape for grilling or else slip into mush too fast. If peaches stay firm but yield slightly to touch, prime for grilling."
- "Reserve tomato marinade for vinaigrettes or drizzle extra on bruschetta."
- "Garlic-rubbed toast complements creamy burrata like nothing else. Rosemary optional but recommended for piney aroma."
- "If burrata unavailable, try stracciatella cheese inside creamy mozzarella pouch, but not as rich."
- "Cleanup trick: wad used parchment and foil to catch tomato drips, avoids flare-ups on grill."
introduction: "Toss the sweet summer heft of peaches against the creamy, filthy burrata--the best contrast of texture you’ll taste all year. I learned early that grilled peaches turn sticky-sweet quickly, so watch them, flip fast. Cherry tomatoes confit is a game changer; slower than roasting, but tomatoes stay juicy, luscious under gentle heat, avoid that dry crackle. Sherry vinegar sneaks in a rustic depth into the marinade instead of the usual white balsamic. Smoke from paprika wakes up dull acidity. You need bread, rustic crunchy bread, toasted with rosemary and garlic to scoop this all up because juices run wild. Basil isn’t just garnish, it’s punchy herbal freshness snatched from the vine at last minute—don’t skip. Dust with flaky salt and crack pepper before serving or flavor will seem flat. This is a grown-up fruit salad, the kind you remember from shared meals outdoors."
ingredientsNote: "Cherry tomatoes must be ripe but firm, not mushy. Avoid very soft or squishy ones; they collapse too much confiting. Swap sherry vinegar for apple cider or white wine vinegar if needed; balsamic dark isn’t a good substitute here (too heavy). Maple syrup thickens confit juices better than honey, but honey’s fine if that’s all you have; mixed is fine too. Peaches must be ripe but still able to hold their shape—don’t pick rock hard or mushy ones. Olive oil: good quality is worth it, cheap oil tastes flat, especially raw over burrata. Basil fresh and green, no wilted leaves, torn or whole, depending on texture preference. Burrata quality makes or breaks dish—skip canned mozzarella or you’ll regret it. Bread toasted, ideally rubbed with garlic while warm, plus some chopped rosemary added pre-toast or just after. Flaky sea salt is non-negotiable for crunch and seasoning. Pepper freshly cracked for best aroma. Smoked paprika is subtle, can be replaced with a pinch of cayenne for heat but the smoky note changes."
instructionsNote: "Marinating tomatoes before cooking pulls out flavor and seasons them through, but draining prevents sogginess in packet. Double layers of parchment and foil protect tomatoes from direct grill intensity, slow softening rather than collapsing to juice. Watch tomatoes carefully during cooking; look for just-beginning-to-shrink texture, not popping or bursting. Peaches grilling: the smell when skin chars slightly–that’s your cue. If peaches wrinkle too much and juices run freely, too late. Burrata temp matters—too cold cheese dulls flavor, allow 20-30 min to warm on counter. Spoon out inner liquid from cut burrata; it’s precious. Honey drizzle balances heat and acidity but add sparingly or it’ll dominate. Basil added last for fragrance, never before cooking or it wilts. Serve immediately after assembling, texture contrast between warm peaches & tomatoes and cool burrata is essential. Leftovers? Not recommended, fresh is everything here. Toast should be crisp and sturdy enough to scoop and dip sans instant sogginess. Keep grill tools handy for quick flipping and moving; this dish demands attention. Parchment helps cleanup after tomatoes and prevents flare-ups while adding gentle steam. Dry grill grates before cooking peaches to prevent sticking. Don’t skimp on salt finish; flaky salt adds texture and hits flavor high notes. Pepper to taste, freshly cracked over top for aroma spike."
tips:
- "Heat grill medium-low for tomatoes, avoids flare-ups and char. Use paper towel soaked in oil and tongs not brush on grates, oil helps no stick. Drain tomatoes well after marinating, prevents soggy foil packets. Double layer foil and parchment holds steam low, soft cooks, no burst or juice spills. Watch tomatoes closely; gentle sizzle means ready, no loud crackles. Timing 12-15 minutes but eyes count more than clock."
- "Grill peaches direct heat. Brush with olive oil evenly so grilling caramelizes sugars without mush. Listen for low crackle, flip fast to avoid juices running. 4-6 minutes total usually. Skin chars lightly signals close. Too much juice means overcooked, slips into mush territory, ruins contrast. Pick peaches ripe but firm, never rock hard or mushy. Texture key here. Burrata sits on plate while fruits are warm; cool cheese dulls flavor."
- "Use smoked paprika in marinade to replace piment d’Espelette; subtle smoky note, no heat overload. Sherry vinegar instead of white balsamic adds nutty depth, less sweet, more rustic. Maple syrup thickens glaze better than honey alone but honey can blend. Reserve marinade liquid for vinaigrette or drizzle later. Basil tossed last, never in cooking to keep fresh aroma punchy and green bright."
- "Toast sliced bread with garlic and rosemary before serving, adds crunch and piney aroma. Rub garlic clove gently on warm toast, sprinkle chopped rosemary lightly after to avoid burnt bitterness. Bread needs to hold juices, not collapse soggy instantly. Keeps texture contrast sharp. Burrata liquid inside pouch spooned out; precious richness, don’t lose. Serve immediately after assembly; leftovers lose that warm-cool contrast and texture."
- "Temperature of burrata crucial: too cold mutes aroma and flavor, too soft turns messy quickly. Let sit 20-30 min room temp to lift flavors. Tomatoes marinated at least 20 min but drained fully before packet. Cooking indirect heat for foil packet helps slow softening not screaming hot roast. If no grill, oven broiler can work but watch time carefully to avoid drying or bursting. Cleanup easier with parchment layer to catch drips and avoid flare-ups."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap sherry vinegar? a: Sure. Apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar work but balsamic dark throws off balance, too sweet, heavy. Sherry gives nutty rustic flavor. Vinegar helps cut tomatoes acidity; skipping vinegar means softer punch."
- "q: What if peaches get mushy? a: Grill shorter time. Watch skin charring as cue. If juices run too freely, peaches overcooked. Ripe but firm peaches best. Can skip grilling but loses smoky caramel note. Flip quickly to avoid mush spots."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Not recommended. Burrata texture dulls fast; warm fruits get soggy. If needed, store tomatoes and peaches separate refrigerated in airtight containers max 1 day. Burrata better fresh. Bread toasted best fresh too, soggy next day."
- "q: No burrata, use what? a: Stracciatella cheese inside mozzarella pouch available sometimes; less rich but creamy. Fresh mozzarella okay last resort, misses creamy center punch. Flavor and texture change but dish still works. Room temp before serving applies."
