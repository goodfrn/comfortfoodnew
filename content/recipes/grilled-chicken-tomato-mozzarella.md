description: "Chicken cut thin grilled with spices; topped with chunky tomato sauce, melted cheese, chopped olives, and fresh herbs. Uses fennel seeds swapped for smoked paprika; chili flakes replaced with red pepper flakes. Cooked on hot grill for crust then topped and finished with gooey cheese and savory olives. Basil swapped for fresh oregano brings earthiness. A bit quicker grilling but watch for drying. Serves four with simple sides."

ingredients:
- "4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves, cut thinly in half"
- "5 ml (1 teaspoon) smoked paprika"
- "5 ml (1 teaspoon) red pepper flakes"
- "180 ml (3/4 cup) chunky tomato sauce, store-bought or homemade"
- "1 ball of fresh buffalo mozzarella 200 g, torn roughly"
- "16 small pitted kalamata olives roughly chopped"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) fresh oregano leaves"
instructions:
- "Heat barbecue to high. Oil the grill grate well so chicken doesn’t stick."
- "Mix smoked paprika and red pepper flakes on large plate. Pat chicken dry, then sprinkle spice mix evenly both sides. Salt and pepper lightly. Rub on a little olive oil to keep moist and to help crust form."
- "Put chicken on grill. Listen for sizzle; a good thin crust is forming—about 5 minutes. Flip carefully. Slather sauce thickly over cooked side."
- "Scatter mozzarella chunks over sauce, then toss olives on top. Close lid or cover with foil to trap heat and melt cheese gently, another 5 minutes or so. Chicken should be firm when pressed but not dry."
- "Pull off heat. Scatter oregano leaves bright and fresh. Serve right away. Leftovers dry out fast."
- "Watch the timing: too fast, cheese burns, too slow, chicken dries. Adjust grill heat accordingly."
- "If you lack a grill, use a hot cast-iron pan with a grill press, flip and use oven broiler finish for melting."
- "Substitutions tip: If no kalamata olives, ripe black olives work but less tangy; oregano can be swapped for thyme or basil but oregano adds rustic punch."
- "Pro tip: Let chicken sit at room temp 15 minutes before grilling—helps cook evenly."
introduction: "Chucking chicken on a screaming hot grill. I used to overcook it—dry, tough, that fibrous nightmare everyone hates. Found that cutting breasts thin, seasoning with smoky paprika and red flakes, trick is making a quick crust that traps juices. Sauce thick, chunky tomato—homemade or canned. Cheese? Buffalo mozzarella, not that rubbery shredded stuff. Tearing it rough gives better melt. Kalamata olives punch salty umami, fresh oregano cuts brightness. Grilling then topping, cover just long enough to coax cheese melt without stewing chicken in steam. Crispy spots under sauce are gold. Heat and timing are everything here. Tried swapping fennel seeds—too subtle for me; smoked paprika brings smoky heat backbone. Past attempts with dried basil bored me—oregano feels alive. Will ruin your appetite if you overdo sauce, drown the grill marks. Serve with buttered pasta or crisp salad. Watch chicken texture like you watch a fire, it tells you when it’s done."
ingredientsNote: "Swapped out fennel seeds for smoked paprika—it’s bolder, smokier, pairs better with grill char. Chili flakes replaced with milder fiery red pepper flakes because too much burn can overwhelm fresh mozzarella’s milky notes. Reduced mozzarella ball to 200 grams—less cheese, better balance, avoids soggy mess. Kalamata olives provide sharp salty punch replacing the milder black olives, more flavor pop. Fresh oregano instead of basil; oregano’s earthy, sharp, stands out even with strong tomato and smoky spices. Cutting breasts thin halves cooking time, sets uniform thickness so don’t fuss flipping too often. Keep chicken just oiled enough so spices stick and grill marks form crisp. Sauce can be homemade chunky diced tomatoes with garlic or store-bought thicker passata. If fresh mozzarella unavailable, burrata or torn cow's milk mozzarella is okay but less stringy melt. Salt and pepper sparingly—pomodoro and olives bring salt load. Room temp chicken cooks evenly; cold meat makes crust lay down boringly, end up dried out."
instructionsNote: "Grilling thin-cut chicken means high heat, quick cook—listen for that sear, look for golden crust, don’t poke endlessly or it’ll dry. After flipping, spread chunky sauce thick—but not drowning—to create steaming bed under cheese. Don’t slide cheese on too neatly. Tear chunks rough and scatter; more surface area melts faster. Adding olives last avoids them shrinking too much and turning bitter. Cover surface to trap heat for about 5 minutes but don’t just sit—peek under foil or lid, cheese should start bubbling, chicken firm but not rigid. Remove right away; resting makes juices redistribute, but no more cooking. If indoors, hot cast iron with broiler finish mimics grill—watch closely, cheese burns fast. Avoid overcrowding; grill spots need space for heat air to circulate. Serving with simple buttered pasta or crisp salad offsets robust smoky, salty notes here. Timing’s a dance—trust grill marks and feel under finger—not clock. Don’t skip letting chicken rest at room temp before grilling, it halves frustration and gives more even crust."
tips:
- "Cut chicken breasts thin halves. Sets uniform thickness for even cooking. Thick chunks make heat uneven, dry edges first. Thin cuts get quick crust. Spray or brush oil sparingly so spices stick but skin stays dry; helps crust form fast."
- "Spice mix spread on plate to coat easy both sides; pat dry first to help cling. Smoked paprika adds smoky backbone missing from fennel seed swap. Red pepper flakes milder than chili flakes but still bite—watch heat. Salt modestly; olives and sauce have salt already."
- "Timing’s everything: grilling hot, listen for sizzle to start crust without burning. Flip once crust forms, spread chunky sauce thick but don’t drown. Rough torn mozzarella melts faster, more surface area. Scatter olives last to avoid bitterness."
- "Cover grill or foil lid to trap heat melting cheese; about 5 minutes usually. Peek often. Chicken should feel firm yet springy, not rubbery or dry. Pull off heat immediately when done; no resting on grill or juices run out dry. Rest off heat for redistribution."
- "If no grill, hot cast iron pan with grill press plus broiler finish works well. Watch cheese melt close, burns quick indoor. Swap kalamata olives for black ripe—less tangy but similar salt. Oregano beats basil for bright earthiness—thyme works too but less punch."
faq:
- "q: How do I know chicken is done without cutting? a: Firm to finger pressure; slight bounce but no jiggle. Sizzle drops off. Look for golden crust edges; sauce bubbling. Too soft means undercooked. Avoid poking too much—drying risk."
- "q: Can I use other cheeses? a: Burrata or torn cow mozzarella okay—less stringy or melts. Avoid shredded prepackaged cheese—won’t melt like buffalo mozzarella. Cheese choice changes texture, melt speed. Adjust time to avoid burning."
- "q: What if sauce is too watery? a: Thick sauce better for topping—chunky diced tomato or store-bought passata works. Thin sauce drips, drowns crust. Simmer extra if needed or strain. Sauce thickness affects melting layer and crust texture."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Fridge in airtight container best but dries fast. Reheat gently under low grill or oven to avoid toughness. Avoid microwave if possible; it ruins texture. Eat within 1-2 days max or chicken gets rubbery."
