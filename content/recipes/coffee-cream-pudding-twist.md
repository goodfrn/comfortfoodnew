ingredients:
- "350 ml (1 1/2 cups) 35% cream"
- "90 ml (3/8 cup) strong cold brew coffee or decaf"
- "90 ml (3/8 cup) granulated sugar"
- "20 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) arrowroot powder"
- "4 egg yolks"
- "55 g (2 oz) white chocolate, chopped"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) powdered sugar"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) ground cinnamon, sifted"
instructions:
- "Combine 265 ml (1 1/8 cups) cream with cold brew in bowl. Set aside."
- "In saucepan, whisk sugar, arrowroot powder, and egg yolks off the heat."
- "Gradually stir in cream-cold brew mix."
- "Heat gently, stirring constantly, scraping sides and bottom, until boiling point reached. Thick and creamy. About 12 min."
- "Remove from heat, stir in chopped white chocolate until melted and smooth. Strain if lumpy."
- "Pour into six small cups. Cover with plastic wrap and chill 1.5-2.5 hours or overnight."
- "Whip remaining cream (85 ml/1/3 cup) with powdered sugar till soft peaks form."
- "Dollop or pipe whipped cream atop set pudding just before serving."
- "Dust surface with sifted cinnamon instead of cocoa powder."
introduction: "Coffee and cream. Thickened custard, silky but firm. Milk chocolate swapped to white, sweeter, different tone. Replacing cornstarch with arrowroot for subtle texture change. Cold brew instead of espresso, smoother bitterness. Whipped cream with powdered sugar like usual, but topping dusted with cinnamon adds new spice dimension. Slightly less cream and coffee used. Sugar decreased; ingredients trimmed around thirty percent. Cooking steps jump: mix dry, add wet slow; heat slow to boil, stir constantly, no lumps. Cool faster, chill less or overnight. Prep and wait below original but texture holds. Presentation neat: six servings. Simple, sharp, but varied in taste and feel."
ingredientsNote: "Reduced cream to just over 300 ml, keeping richness but lighter. Using cold brew instead of espresso cuts acid but keeps coffee punch. Arrowroot powder replaces more common cornstarch; lighter, clearer texture on cooling. White chocolate swaps the usual milk chocolate: sweeter, subtler cocoa notes, melts differently. Powdered sugar for sweetening whipped cream, not granulated. Cinnamon replaces cocoa powder for surface dusting—introduces warm spice instead of bitterness. Egg yolks untouched, vital for thickening and bite. Sugar lowered a bit to balance white chocolate’s natural sweetness. Quantities shift 30% lower for smaller portions or different consistency, but final volume and servings remain six."
instructionsNote: "Start blending coffee and cream off heat, keeps coffee aroma. Dry ingredients and yolk mix whisked before wet joins avoids lumps. Heat thickening phase slow, constant stirring; thick custard forms gently. After boiling, remove from flame immediately, folding in chocolate slowly until completely melted, smooth. Sifting custard after heating ensures any bits gone—silky. Pour into cups, plastic wrap pressed on top avoids skin forming. Chill shortened slightly but can be overnight for convenience. Whipping cream with powdered sugar to soft peaks ensures light topping, piped or spooned over pudding just prior to serving. Final dust of cinnamon instead of traditional cocoa offers unexpected warm flavor contrast. Serve cold, neat portions. Small time adjustments mimic gently changing texture and chill speed."
tips:
- "Chill your coffee and cream first. It helps to keep the flavor bright. Combine cold ingredients off heat for aromatic blend. Mix slowly, avoid splashes too."
- "Whisk dry ingredients before adding wet. No lumps! Keep an eye on it. Stirring constantly as it heats is key. Prevents sticking, burns. Scrape sides well."
- "For smoother texture, strain the mix after adding chocolate. Important. This step catches lumps. You want silky custard, don’t skip it."
- "Use fresh ground cinnamon. Better flavor than pre-ground. Sifting is essential for topping. A light dusting gives presentation a lift. Show off your cooking."
- "Plastic wrap pressed on top prevents skin from forming. Avoids unsightly crust. Chill cups tightly. Can do overnight. Texture stays creamy longer this way."
faq:
- "q: How to serve? a: Cold portions are best. Serve with dollop of whipped cream on top. Dust with cinnamon. Looks nice, tastes great."
- "q: Can I use regular chocolate? a: White chocolate used for sweetness. But yes, substitute if preferred. Milk or dark can work too. Adjust sweetness."
- "q: What if my pudding is too runny? a: Heat longer during cooking phase. Stir continually until thickened. Adjust arrowroot if needed. Try more next time."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep covered in fridge. Good for 2-3 days. Just rewhip cream before serving. Freshens it up a lot."
