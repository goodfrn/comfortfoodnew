slug: "crunchy-asian-slaw"
description: "Crunchy shredded green and purple cabbage married with sweet carrot ribbons. Honey and rice vinegar mingle with toasted sesame and peanut oils, bringing nutty warmth. Faint heat from crushed chili flakes lifts it. Crisp chow mein noodles and toasted almonds pepper texture contrast. Vinaigrette cooked briefly to meld, thickens just right. Cold resting builds flavor depth. Adjust oils for nut allergies. Quick chop, toss, serve alongside chicken, pork, or shrimp. A riff on Asian slaw but with subtle tweaks and texture shifts. Vibrant, light, crunchy, sweet and tangy all at once. Feels fresh but with some toasted nuance. Keeps well chilled, noodles separate until ready to serve. "

ingredients:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) rice vinegar"
- "50 ml (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) honey"
- "6 ml (1 1/4 teaspoons) cornstarch"
- "3 ml (a scant 1/2 teaspoon) salt"
- "A pinch crushed red pepper flakes"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) peanut oil"
- "90 ml (3/8 cup) toasted sesame oil"
- "=== Salad ==="
- "1.2 litre (4 3/4 cups) finely shredded green cabbage (mandolin or knife)"
- "700 ml (2 3/4 cups) finely shredded red cabbage"
- "2 medium carrots, julienned very thin"
- "200 ml (3/4 cup) crunchy fried chow mein noodles"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) sliced toasted almonds"
- "Freshly ground black pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "=== Vinaigrette ==="
- "1. In a small saucepan, whisk together rice vinegar, honey, cornstarch, salt, and red pepper flakes. Heat over medium, stirring constantly with a whisk. As soon as it bubbles, keep stirring for about 20 seconds—look for the mixture to thicken slightly, a sheen appears, not too gloopy."
- "2. Remove from heat. Slowly drizzle in peanut and sesame oils while whisking vigorously to emulsify. This layering of oils keeps the dressing bright, not greasy. Add fresh cracked pepper now. Let chill in fridge covered until cooled, flavors knit together nicely — about 10-15 min."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "3. Combine shredded green and red cabbage with thin carrot sticks in a large bowl. The cabbage must be fine—mandolin saves energy and keeps even texture. Heavier pieces tear mouthfeel."
- "4. Pour vinaigrette over cabbage mix a little at a time, tossing to coat but not saturate. Stop when cabbage glistens but no puddle remains. Taste—adjust salt, pepper, or even a touch more honey if needed."
- "5. Just before serving, fold in crunchy fried chow mein noodles and toasted almonds. They soften if added too soon. Toss gently to keep clusters intact."
- "6. Serve immediately as bright side with grilled chicken, pork, or shrimp; leftovers keep chilled in fridge, add noodles last minute."
- "=== Notes on Timing and Technique ==="
- "The key is in timing: cook vinaigrette until just thickened, no more; too hot or thick makes clumps. Emulsify oils slow, or dressing separates. Fine shred for cabbage—not coarse or chew becomes a problem. Adding noodles too early? They soak and turn mushy. Wait. Toast almonds yourself for max crunch, watch carefully—they burn quick, toss at first golden sizzle. If missing peanut oil, substitute canola or mild vegetable oil but lose some aroma. No rice vinegar? Mild white vinegar plus a touch of lime juice can stand in."
- "Troubleshoot acidity by balancing honey sweeter; if vinaigrette splits, whisk vigorously or chill and stir before serving."
- "Flavor deepens as it chills but serve within 24 hours for best crunch and freshness."
introduction: "Crunchy textures marry sweet-tangy flavors in this Asian-inspired cabbage slaw. Shredded green and purple cabbage forms the crisp base; thin julienned carrots add sweet snap. Vinaigrette simmers briefly to meld honey and rice vinegar with a kick of chili, thickened just right with cornstarch. Oils—peanut and toasted sesame—bring fragrant warmth, emulsified by patient whisking, never rushed, always coaxed. Toss in crunchy fried chow mein noodles, toasted almonds at last minute—texture layered, never soggy. The idea? Balance acid and sweet, crunchy and soft, toasted aroma and fresh snap. Chill it short then serve alongside anything grilled; pork, chicken, shrimp—the crunch holds. Ditch peanuts or adjust sweet if your kitchen mood shifts. Learned this after too-sour first tries, careful heat and exact timing make all the difference. Every bite snaps and melts across the palate."
ingredientsNote: "Mandoline for shredding saves time and keeps cabbage thin enough to avoid toughness; knife works if patient. Swap honey for maple syrup or agave to suit sweetness preference or for vegan twist. Rice vinegar can be tricky if missing, white vinegar with lime juice can mimic acidity. Oils matter: toasted sesame oil adds deep aroma; if missing, use regular sesame or olive for a twist but flavor shifts. Peanut oil might trigger allergies — use neutral canola but lose flavor depth. Toast almonds just before mixing to maintain crunch; store separately if prepping ahead. Julienne carrots paper-thin for vibrant texture rather than thick crunchy chunks. Fried chow mein noodles bought or homemade both work — key is to add them at last to dodge sogginess. Salt balances acidity—taste often. Chili flakes pinch optional, adjust as you like or swap for fresh chili. Keep dressing cold once made; it thickens and flavors meld in fridge. Resting vinaigrette with a cover prevents odors from infusing."
instructionsNote: "Heat vinegar, honey, and cornstarch until barely bubbling, swirl whisk continuously to avoid lumps. Watch for coat on spoon, a glossy sheen signals thickening—too long, too thick equals gummy. Remove from heat immediately. Whisk oils in slow drizzle to emulsify; patience matters here or it’ll break. Chill dressing for a short spell before tossing, flavors meld but if too long, oils firm up and thicken unnaturally. When mixing cabbage and carrots, handle gently not to bruise but evenly coat to avoid watery bottom. Add noodles and almonds just before plating, folding in to keep clusters intact, crunch unapologetic. Adjust seasoning after dressing and salad marry, plate with fresh cracked pepper. Serve right away or keep cold but fresh — noodles hold crisp only if last minute. If dressing separates, whisk vigorously or chill and mix again. Buy fried noodles fresh or make at home with thin egg noodles fried in neutral oil until puffed and golden, drain well."
tips:
- "Watch vinaigrette closely as it cooks. Heat medium, whisk nonstop. Look for tiny bubbles then 20 seconds more. Sheen signals thickening. Remove right away or gummy mess. Oils add aroma but drizzle slow to emulsify or sauce breaks. Patience beats speed here."
- "Shred cabbage thin. Mandoline is lifesaver. Knife works but takes effort. Bigger pieces mean chew, tear mouthfeel. Carrots julienned paper-thin snap sweet and add contrast. Toss gently or juice pools. Crispness depends on fine shred and quick toss."
- "Add noodles and almonds last second. Noodles soak fast, turn mushy quick if too soon. Almonds burn fast too so toast just before mixing. Keep toasted nuts separate if prepping ahead. Crunch is texture backbone so timing is non-negotiable."
- "Adjust oils for allergy or flavor shift. Peanut oil lends nutty warmth but swap canola if needed. Toasted sesame oil key for aroma depth — no sub kills theme though regular sesame or olive can work but different game. Vinegar swap tricky too; white + lime holds acidity balance."
- "Rest vinaigrette covered in fridge for 10-15 min after sauce cools. Flavors meld, thicken slightly. Don’t chill too long or oils firm weirdly. Whisk again if dressing splits before serving. Taste and tweak salt, honey balance. Chili flakes optional but add lift."
faq:
- "q: How thick should vinaigrette get? a: Thin sheen coats spoon. Not jelly. Bubble then 20 sec. Too thick equals gummy clumps. Watch color change slightly. Stop heat immediately. Timing is key."
- "q: Can I skip peanuts and use other oils? a: Yes. Canola or mild veggie oil works but lose deep nut aroma. Toasted sesame keeps aroma if missing peanut oil. Olive oil shifts taste, use cautiously. Allergy calls for neutral oils but changes flavor."
- "q: Why do noodles get soggy? a: Added too early. Noodles soak moisture fast. Add last minute, right before serving. Keep separate till then. Crunch lost if fold in early, texture fails. Timing crucial for crisp bite."
- "q: How long store salad? a: Best fresh same day but can keep in fridge 24 hrs. Store dressing separate if possible. Add noodles last minute. Almonds toasted fresh stay crunchy. Chill covered vinaigrette to avoid odors. Toss gently before plating."
