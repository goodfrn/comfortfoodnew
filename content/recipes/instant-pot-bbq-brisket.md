ingredients:
- "2 teaspoons kosher salt"
- "1 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 teaspoon onion powder"
- "1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef brisket"
- "1 large onion sliced"
- "3 cloves garlic smashed"
- "1 cup beef broth"
- "1 cup ketchup"
- "1/4 cup apple cider vinegar"
- "3 tablespoons molasses"
- "1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce"
- "2 teaspoons minced garlic"
- "1 teaspoon Liquid Smoke"
- "1 teaspoon chili powder"
- "1/4 teaspoon white pepper"
- "1/2 teaspoon celery salt"
- "1 teaspoon yellow mustard"
instructions:
- "Mix kosher salt, garlic powder, onion powder in small bowl. Rub brisket on both sides after pounding lightly with meat mallet. Set aside to let salt do its work while prepping sauce."
- "In medium bowl whisk: ketchup, apple cider vinegar, molasses instead of brown sugar, Worcestershire, minced garlic, Liquid Smoke, chili powder, white pepper, celery salt, mustard. Molasses gives darker, richer sweetness and better caramelization later."
- "Place sliced onion and smashed garlic cloves at bottom of Instant Pot inner pot. Pour beef broth over them for steam base."
- "Lay brisket over aromatics. Pour half the BBQ sauce on top, coating well but saving half to heat separately for serving—avoids overcooking sauce and flavor dulling."
- "Seal lid. Set Manual, high pressure for about 55 minutes instead of 60. Brisket should resist gently but pull apart easily when done. Natural release 10 minutes, then quick release remaining pressure. Listen for hissing stop, grab lid cautiously."
- "While brisket cooks, pour reserved BBQ sauce into small pan. Warm gently on low, stirring occasionally. Thickens slightly, smells deep. Watch not to burn sugars."
- "Remove brisket to board. Notice juices, slightly gelatinous glaze. Let rest 5-10 min. Slice thinly against the grain–key to tenderness, else chew fest."
- "Serve with warm BBQ sauce spooned over. Try with crusty bread or a crisp slaw for crunch contrast."
- "If brisket feels tough, consider adding a few extra minutes pressure next time or slicing thinner."
- "Swapping beef broth for mushroom stock adds umami boost. No Liquid Smoke? Smoked paprika 1/2 to 1 tsp works."
- "Common slip: overpounding meat mallet can make texture mushy; just enough to even thickness and break connective tissue gently."
introduction: "Brisket in an Instant Pot—gets tender fast but needs seasoning muscle. Salt rub hits the meat deep, garlic and onion powder bring punch. I learned pounding brisket lightly makes a difference, while too much crushes fibers into mushy. Sauce balance tricky—sweet, tangy, smoky, and heat all jostling. Molasses swaps better for brown sugar if you want punch from caramel notes. Pressure cooking setup counts: aromatics in pot bottom keep meat juicy and flavor charged during steam bath. After cooking, brisket yields gentle resistance and the smell—garlic, vinegar, smoke—signals readiness. Slicing against grain vital: thin cuts unlock buttery texture. Warm sauce separately; nothing worse than boiled-off spicy sweetness. Brisket pairs great with tangy or crunchy sides to cut richness."
ingredientsNote: "Kosher salt is the backbone of seasoning here, not just flavor but texture—draws moisture, improves tenderness over resting time. Garlic and onion powders anchor the rub with classic savory notes. Brisket cuts can vary; 1 1/2 to 2 pounds ideal for pressure pot. Onion and whole smashed garlic cloves create an aromatic steamy environment that buffers direct heat. Beef broth adds flavor and moisture—mushroom broth or stock works well to deepen umami. Switched brown sugar for molasses; richer, less sweet, thicker sauce results. Worcestershire offers saltiness and complexity; Liquid Smoke’s key for that authentic smokey impression. Chili powder adds warmth; celery salt and white pepper build subtle layers. Yellow mustard powder or prepared mustard cuts sharpness and thickens sauce. If unavailable, smoked paprika and honey could substitute molasses and Liquid Smoke. Don’t skip whisking sauce ingredients well before use, solids settle quickly."
instructionsNote: "Tenderizing brisket with a mallet is to evenly break connective tissue but resist pulverizing the meat. Massage salt-spice mix firmly but not abrasive. Starting with aromatics in pot bottom sets up a flavor bed—we use onion slices and crushed garlic for slow, sweet release under the brisket. Pouring beef broth creates moisture steam locked in lid. Pressure cooking around 55 minutes pushes brisket into fork-tender territory without drying out—longer cook risks stringiness or mush. Natural pressure release lets juices redistribute gently. Retaining half BBQ sauce cold keeps serving sauce flavorful and fresh, warming it separately avoids burned sugar and bitterness. Rest brisket; observe juice pooling and elasticity beneath your knife—key doneness clues. Slice against grain; the longest fibers run top to bottom. Sharpened chef’s knife essential. Serving ideas: spoon warm BBQ sauce liberally, pair with complementary textures like pickles or slaws. Watch sauce thickness when heating, stir often, medium-low heat prevents scorching. Common error: no rest period or slicing with grain leads to tough bites. Adjust pressure time slightly if brisket cut varies in thickness."
tips:
- "Salt rub tight on brisket. Pound lightly to break fibers not mash. Rest rub time crucial, moisture pulls and texture shifts under salt pressure. Aromatics on pot bottom create steam barrier. Onions, smashed garlic give hint of sweetness, soften under steam. Watch pressure time close. 55 mins hits tender but not falling apart. Pressure release start natural—10 min releases trapped steam slow, keeps juices inside. Quick release after that stops overcooking."
- "Sauce mix needs constant whisk before use; molasses is thick, settles fast. Pour half on brisket before cooking, rest heat slow afterward. Low simmer only. Sugar scorch easy, smells burnt fast. Sauce thickens to dark glaze, deeper flavor. Worcestershire adds salt edge, Liquid Smoke not optional here, but swap smoked paprika if none. Mustard smooths sharp edges in sauce, balance heat from chili powder fine-tune with small pinch."
- "Cut brisket thin, never thick chunks. Grain direction key. Against grain unlocks tenderness, fibres snap clean. Thick slices = chew fest. Slice after resting 5-10 min, juice redistributes. Surface looks wet, slight shine, slight jiggle—signs done right. If tough, add minutes pressure next try, but watch doneness carefully. Mallet use is not pounding rage. Gentle breaks connective tissues only, not turn mush."
- "Broth base flexible. Beef broth standard but mushroom stock adds umami depth. Liquid Smoke create smoky vibe but no overuse. Less better than more. Garlic powder, onion powder blends anchor rub but skip fresh powders or risk uneven salt. Celery salt, white pepper fine layers; never skip. Swap mustard powder with prepared yellow mustard but adjust liquid ratio in sauce accordingly. Watch sauce consistency and aroma carefully while warming separately."
- "Rest is not optional. Skipping resting means juices run out on cutting board. Rest time lets brisket absorb steam bath flavor, juices settle inside meat fibers. Visual cue—glaze thickens slight, color deepens, aroma stronger. Slice on sharp knife, firm pressure, smooth even strokes. Use crusty bread or cool crunchy slaw to cut rich layers on plate. Pounding mistakes common—just enough to flatten and expose meat surface, no pulverizing. Keep heat medium-low while reheating sauce, stir often."
faq:
- "q: How to tell brisket doneness? a: Listen for gentle resistance when poked. Feels like soft push but not falling apart. Look for slight glossy glaze on surface. Smell garlic, smoky vinegar mix faint but distinct. Juices jiggle slightly beneath. Slice thin test reveals texture, chewy means undercooked, mush means overdone."
- "q: Can I skip pounding brisket? a: You can. But pounding breaks tough fibers gently, evens thickness for cooking. Skip and often get inconsistent textures, outer layers tougher. Use mallet lightly, not smash. If you go no pound, add few more minutes in cooker. Uniform thickness matters for even pressure cooking."
- "q: What if no Liquid Smoke available? a: Smoked paprika substitute works well. Add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon depending on taste. It won't be smoky as real liquid but gives aroma hint. You can also add chipotle powder in pinch for heat plus smoke. Worcestershire adds some umami that covers lack of smoke too."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Cool brisket to room temp quickly, refrigerate covered tightly. Sauce separate in container. Lasts 3-4 days fridge. Freeze sliced brisket with sauce in freezer bag for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight fridge. Reheat gentle, low heat to keep texture intact, stir sauce to avoid sugar burning. Avoid microwave unless careful with short bursts."
