title: "Cran-Choco Rustic Loaf"
slug: "cran-choco-loaf"
description: "A 700 gram loaf with dried cranberries and chopped dark chocolate folded into a simple artisan dough. Whole wheat flour coats the surface, creating a rustic crust. No eggs or nuts, made with instant yeast, salt, and cold water. Long fermentation enhances flavor. Double rise with a heavy covered pot bake at 235°C, then uncovered for the finishing crust. Yield one loaf roughly 1 1/2 pounds. Texture moist, crumb studded with fruit and chocolate pockets. Simple ingredients, a bit of waiting time for full development."

ingredients:
- "490 g unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "110 g dried cranberries"
- "45 g bittersweet chocolate, chopped"
- "6 ml fine sea salt"
- "3 ml instant yeast"
- "400 ml cold water"
- "35 g whole wheat flour for coating"
instructions:
- "=== Dough ==="
- "1. In a large cast iron pot or heavy-bottomed pan, combine flour, cranberries, chopped chocolate, salt and yeast. Pour in cold water."
- "2. Stir with a fork just enough to wet all flour. Dough will be shaggy, uneven. Cover tightly and let rest 7 to 11 hours at room temp, overnight preferred."
- "=== Dusting ==="
- "3. Scatter whole wheat flour over a clean work surface or in a bowl. Set aside."
- "4. Deflate dough directly in the pot by folding inward 5 to 7 times until fairly uniform. Shape loosely."
- "5. Thoroughly dust dough with whole wheat flour coating on all sides."
- "6. Line pot bottom with parchment paper. Place floured dough in center, cover again. Let rest 40 minutes or until doubled in volume in a bit under room temperature."
- "7. Preheat oven with rack in middle to 235°C (455°F)."
- "8. Bake covered for 28 minutes. Remove lid and bake uncovered another 28 minutes until crust dark and slightly blistered."
- "9. Cool in pot until lukewarm. Transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling well. Brush off excess flour or leave for rustic look."
introduction: "Long rest with minimal mixing. Cranberries dried, chewy pockets. Dark chocolate broken into chunks, rough texture. Flour as base, no fancy stuff, no eggs, no nuts. Cold water pulls gluten slowly. Overnight fermentation. The dough sits, swells, changes, flops around. Turns sticky to something manageable after folding. Whole wheat flour envelops the dough, grit on the surface, ready for the covered bake. Hot oven steam traps moisture, cracks notable after lid off. Cool completely or the crumb soggy inside. This loaf rustic, not neat. Oozes simplicity. Sweet-sour fruit bites with bittersweet hit. Crisp crust meets tender heart. Waiting pays."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust flour types if needed; unbleached regular flour is a good base, but you can swap 25% for spelt or rye if you want more tangy notes. Cranberries bring tartness, but other dried fruits like cherries or blueberries with similar moisture work. Chocolate bits must be good quality dark, at least 60% cocoa to avoid too much sweetness. Salt not to skip, balances flavors. Instant yeast preferred for quick proof. Cold water limits yeast speed, controls growth. Whole wheat flour for coating adds texture and helps prevent stickiness during handling and rises. Quantities lowered about 30% for lighter loaf, times shifted slightly for ambient variations."
instructionsNote: "Start by mixing flour and add-ins dry, distributing fruit and chocolate well. Gradually add water, stir until paste forms; no need for fully smooth dough, shaggy is okay. The long room temperature rest does the heavy lifting in gluten development, so skip kneading. Folding to deflate dough is essential after first rise to redistribute air and equalize texture—about six folds needed. Dusting surface liberally prevents dough from sticking, making transfers easier. A lined pot traps steam during early bake for rise and crust formation; remove lid mid-bake to dry the crust for bite and color. Let cool inside pot for a bit to set crumb before removing. Use airflow to finish drying crumb, resist slicing too early or loaves turn gummy."
tips:
- "Cold water slows yeast, keeps dough from rushing. Mix flour, dried fruit, chocolate dry first to spread evenly. Stir gently. Rest 7 to 11 hours at room temp works best; dough changes texture, sticky to manageable after fold."
- "Folding helps degas, redistribute moisture. Fold 5 to 7 times in pot, no knead needed. Dough looks slack but gains strength. Shaggy is okay this stage. Keep surface dusted with whole wheat flour for grip. Makes handling easier."
- "Use cast iron or heavy pot for baking. Lining bottom with parchment stops sticking. Covered bake traps steam, crust sets without drying too fast. After 28 minutes remove lid, finish bake uncovered for blistered, dark crust."
- "Wait to slice till loaf cools well, crumb sets. Cutting warm loaf risks gummy texture inside. Cooling inside pot till lukewarm then wire rack finish is key. Dust off excess flour or leave it rustic for texture."
- "Adjust flour if needed, swap 25% for rye or spelt for tangy notes. Fruit varies, cherries or blueberries similar moisture work. Chocolate at least 60% cocoa avoid sweetness overload. Salt balances flavors – don’t skip."
faq:
- "q: Why cold water? a: Slows yeast. Controls fermentation speed. Gluten develops over long rest. No quick rise. Dough texture starts shaggy, changes by fold. Essential for flavor depth."
- "q: Can I use fresh cranberries? a: Dried best for moisture balance. Fresh adds too much water, tough to handle. Swap with other dried fruits with similar chew. Adjust water slightly if using fresh."
- "q: What if loaf is dense? a: Undermixing or short rest maybe. Folding redistributes gases, helps rise. Yeast amount low but enough with long room temp ferment. Proof dough fully before baking."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep wrapped room temp - few days only. Refrigerate dries crumb. Freeze slices tightly wrapped. Thaw at room temp, crisp by toasting after."
