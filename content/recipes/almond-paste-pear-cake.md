slug: "almond-paste-pear-cake"
description: "Wine-poached pears nestled upright in a tender almond paste cake. Red wine, cinnamon stick, and vanilla bean infuse the pears slowly. The batter blends softened butter, sugar, diced almond paste, and eggs. Flour and baking powder fold in gently. Poached pears stay intact in the mold, supporting the luscious cake interior as it bakes. Takes a bit over an hour. Pear stems wrapped in foil to avoid burning. Cool before unmolding. Serve with or without syrup. About ten servings."

ingredients:
- "=== POACHED PEARS ==="
- "600 ml (2 1/2 cups) dry red wine"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) granulated sugar"
- "1 small cinnamon stick"
- "1 whole vanilla bean split lengthwise"
- "4 Bartlett or Anjou pears, ripe but firm"
- "=== CAKE ==="
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) all-purpose flour"
- "3 ml (3/4 teaspoon) baking powder"
- "110 ml (7 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) unsalted butter at room temp"
- "100 ml (7 tablespoons) sugar"
- "180 g (6.5 oz) diced marzipan"
- "3 large eggs"
instructions:
- "=== POACHED PEARS ==="
- "1. Combine wine, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla in a saucepan. Heat to boil. Simmer 3-4 minutes."
- "2. Peel pears carefully, keeping stems intact. Cut pears and stems in halves lengthwise. Scoop out cores."
- "3. Gently add pears to simmering liquid. Bring back to simmer, cook 12-14 minutes gently. Remove from heat. Let cool and refrigerate pears immersed in syrup 4 hours minimum or overnight."
- "=== CAKE ==="
- "4. Position oven rack mid-level. Preheat oven to 175 °C (350 °F). Grease 20 cm (8 inch) springform pan. Line bottom with parchment paper."
- "5. Mix flour and baking powder in bowl. Set aside."
- "6. Beat butter and sugar with electric mixer until fluffy, 3-4 minutes. Add diced marzipan in portions, mixing until mostly blended but some chunks remain. Beat in eggs one at a time until mixture smooth, about 2 minutes. On low speed, fold in dry ingredients until combined."
- "=== ASSEMBLY AND BAKING ==="
- "7. Drain poached pears thoroughly. Pat dry with paper towel. Reserve syrup for later use or other recipes."
- "8. Stand pear halves upright around edge of prepared pan, cut sides facing pan walls. Trim bases as needed to stabilize."
- "9. Spoon cake batter into center of pan, spreading evenly between and around pears."
- "10. Cover pear stems with foil strips to prevent burning during baking."
- "11. Bake about 1 hour 20 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean."
- "12. Cool in pan 15 minutes, then unmold carefully onto wire rack to cool completely."
introduction: "Wine. Almond paste. Pears. All together now. Stems still on, sliced pears slowly poached in aromatic red wine. Cinnamon stick plus vanilla bean for a touch of warmth and sweetness. Slow simmer to soften fruit but keep shape. Chill a good five hours. Or sleep overnight. Batter creamy and buttery. Cubes of marzipan folded in, add pockets of almond flavor and chewy texture. Eggs lift and bind. Flour combined with gentle lift from baking powder. Pan lined, pears placed standing tall around walls. Batter pools in center, surrounding and embracing fruit. Pear tips wrapped with foil — no one likes burnt stems. Bake until cake firm and golden, toothpick test done. Rest. Cool. Remove. All set for slicing and sharing. Slightly dense, moist, a little chewy from marzipan chunks. Wine syrup optional drizzle or keep for cocktails later. Traditional French feel with easy twists. Suitable for lactose-free butter or margarine substitution. Not quick, but worth the wait."
ingredientsNote: "Adjust wine quantity slightly to avoid overwhelming or underflavoring the pears. Vanilla bean adds richness but can be swapped for a teaspoon of vanilla extract if fresh beans are unavailable. Cinnamon stick essential for warm spice note; fresh or good quality dried stick preferred. Pears must be firm to hold shape while poaching; Bartlett or Anjou provide balance of sweetness and texture. Flour measure reduced slightly to balance batter moisture from marzipan and eggs. Baking powder raised a bit for better rise due to almond paste addition. Unsalted butter softened for easy creaming with sugar. Sugar quantity lowered subtly to match expected sweetness from poached pears and marzipan, avoiding overtly sweet cake. Eggs added one by one to ensure uniform batter texture. Marzipan diced rather than grated for interesting textural pockets within cake. Parchment lining critical to avoid sticking especially on heavy batter sides. Foil strips flexible for protecting pear stems during bake."
instructionsNote: "Poaching pears requires attention to simmering temperature—too hot, pears break apart; too cool, not infused. Time adjusted to 12-14 minutes for best texture retention. Cooling poached pears in syrup keeps flavor infused and prevents drying. Batter: creaming time extended slightly to incorporate marzipan bits yet avoid overmixing which could toughen cake. Incorporate eggs gradually for consistent emulsification. Low speed folding of dry ingredients to keep batter tender, avoid gluten development. Position pears upright firmly, cut base flat if needed—won’t bake evenly otherwise. Foil wrap on stems essential; those tend to burn easily. Baking timing extended to 80 minutes to ensure cake set with wet fruit center; toothpick test definitive. Cooling in pan prevents breakage; then unmolding before fully cold to retain moisture. Cake can be served slightly warm or room temp. Syrup from pears versatile to serve with cake or cocktails; refrigerate and reuse quickly."
tips:
- "Start with firm pears. Softer ones won't hold shape when poaching. Aim for ripe but firm, like Bartlett or Anjou. Your timing matters, too. Twelve to fourteen minutes in simmering liquid. Keep an eye on them. Make sure they absorb flavors but stay intact."
- "Don’t skip the foil on pear stems. They tend to burn during baking. The foil acts as a shield. Easy change, big result. Parchment paper on the pan bottom? A must. Heavy batters stick easily. Line it well. It's critical for a smooth release."
- "Mixing matters—beat butter until fluffy. The sugar should blend in well. Add marzipan gradually—mixing in chunks for texture. Fold in dry ingredients gently. Avoid overmixing. Eggs add lift—one at a time. This ensures a smooth batter. Keep mixing short to preserve lightness."
- "Keep poached pears in their syrup for flavor retention. Chilling them makes for a sweeter outcome. Use a toothpick for cake doneness—it’s your best test. And remember—cool down in pan. Then, move to wire rack. It helps with moisture retention."
- "Cake can be served warm or room temperature. It’s adaptable. Drizzle with reserved syrup if desired. Or save that syrup for cocktails. Versatility adds value. Never underestimate your flexibility with this cake. Great alongside coffee or tea."
faq:
- "q: How do I prevent pears from falling apart? a: Keep simmer low. Around 12 to 14 minutes is ideal. Pick pears that are firm. Miller pears break easier. They should be ripe but not mushy."
- "q: Can I use something other than marzipan? a: Yes, but the texture will differ. Almond flour gives a different result. You can use more almond paste or even a different nut paste."
- "q: What if my cake sinks in the middle? a: Often, this means underbaked. Check your oven temperature. A toothpick test is crucial. But if the texture is off, it might be overmixed. Be careful."
- "q: How do I store leftover cake? a: Keep it in the fridge, covered. It stays fresh for a few days. You can freeze it too, if you want. Just wrap tightly."
