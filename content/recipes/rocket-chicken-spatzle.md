description: "Chicken thighs browned with shiitake mushrooms and shallots, simmered in broth. Cherry tomatoes swell, release juice. Arugula stirred in last minute, wilts bright green. Durum wheat spätzle cooked al dente, folded in with Parmesan. No butter, no cream needed. A rustic pasta dish with a peppery edge and umami depth. Quick midweek meal, no fuss. Variations add bell pepper or kale. Cooked patiently, don’t rush liquid reduction or chicken won’t caramelize. Watch spätzle closely, overcooking kills bite. Balance brothy with cheesy, leafy with meaty. A rebel’s take on a German classic with Mediterranean twist."

ingredients:
- "200 g boneless, skinless chicken thighs cut into chunks"
- "200 g fresh shiitake mushrooms sliced"
- "1 large shallot minced"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "70 ml olive oil"
- "400 ml chicken broth"
- "450 ml cherry tomatoes halved"
- "1 bunch arugula (approx 120 g), roughly chopped"
- "350 g spätzle pasta"
- "150 ml pecorino romano grated"
instructions:
- "1. Heat oil in heavy skillet over medium-high. Toss in chicken pieces, spread out. Leave undisturbed till golden brown crust forms, around 5 minutes. Now throw in mushrooms, shallot, and garlic; sauté, stirring occasionally until mushrooms shrink and shallots soften—about 6-7 minutes. Smell deepening, garlic aroma sharp but not burnt."
- "2. Pour in broth. Bring to vigorous boil. Watch bubbles, let it simmer steadily. Cook 12 minutes, reduce liquid by half. Then add cherry tomatoes. They’ll start releasing juice and break down, cook until edges curl, about 7 minutes. Avoid smashing, just gentle mingling."
- "3. Stir in chopped arugula, toss quickly for one minute. Leaves wilt but keep punchy green. There should be a thick but spoon-coating sauce left. Add broth if too dry, sauce shouldn’t drown pasta later."
- "4. Meanwhile, boil salted water in large pot. Cook spätzle till just before tender but firm. Usually 2-3 minutes fresh, 5-6 minutes dried—depends on brand. Drain, reserve a splash cooking water in case."
- "5. Transfer spätzle directly to skillet with chicken mixture. Off heat, sprinkle grated pecorino. Toss vigorously, cheese melts slightly, coats pasta, sauce binds everything. Adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper freshly ground. Serve immediately. Cheese sharpness balances the bitter greens and sweet tomatoes."
- "Tip: If spätzle stick or clump, stir in reserved pasta water little by little. Keep texture lively, never mushy."
introduction: "Skinless chicken thighs, packed with flavor. Shiitake in place of plain white mushrooms—deeper earthiness, meatiness. Shiitake’s chewy texture adds bite. Chose shallots over onion for subtle sweetness, less sharpness under heat. Cherry tomatoes burst late in cooking, punch acidity and soften into sauce. Arugula’s pepper bite contrasts with creamy cheese —pecorino swapped for parmigiano for saltier twist. Spätzle, the German darling, reimagined here with slight Mediterranean flair. Timing matters. Close watch on liquid reduction—too much broth makes dish sloppy. Over- or undercooking mushrooms ruins umami tension. Tried bell peppers but weakened mushroom punch. Kale overwhelms the salad vibe, arugula keeps it snappy. Simple ingredients, complex dance on palate. Efficient midweek but worth patient attention. No butter or cream, olive oil and cheese pull fat. Rustic, yet elegant. Great with chilled white wine or dry rosé. Do not rush or stir aggressively—stay hands-on, sense when sauce glazes chicken and pasta."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken thighs can be swapped for boneless turkey pieces or firm white fish chunks for lighter version. Shiitake mushrooms bring strong flavor; if none, use cremini or portobello as fallback. Shallots better than onions here; their mild sweetness avoids overpowering. Cherry tomatoes preferred for skin-thin burst of flavor and juice; roma tomatoes work if halved small. Spätzle can be replaced by egg noodles or gnocchetti, watch cooking times as they vary. Pecorino romano in place of parmigiano adds sharper tang, salt; good quality aged cheese essential. Arugula is key, peppery bite brightens. Olive oil must be good—don't skimp. Chicken broth homemade or low sodium store-bought; adjust salt in final step. Garlic doesn’t get overcooked here—adds mild background aroma. Keep ingredients fresh, fresh is noticeable in end texture and flavors."
instructionsNote: "Brown chicken without crowding pan to get actual caramelization. Moisture is enemy here—too many chicken pieces crowding create steam, no golden crust. Mushroom and shallot soften and release moisture slowly, building base flavor—don’t rush or high flame can burn garlic. Simmer in broth until reduced about half—liquid should thicken, coating back of spoon. Tomatoes added late so skin doesn't shrivel too much but releases sweet acidity, contributes to sauce viscosity. Stir arugula just before finishing so it wilts but maintains texture and bright flavor. Pasta cooking times vary by brand—always test early for al dente; fish out a piece, bite with slight resistance. Add pasta straight into skillet for best coating, mixing off heat to prevent cheese clumping or stringy melt. If sauce too thick, add reserved pasta water sparingly, it loosens without watering down. Salting done late after reduction—better control. Black pepper freshly ground, never pre-ground. Serve hot immediately—waited too long and spätzle suck sauce dry. Efficiency trick: prep veggies while chicken cooks to save time, multi-task. Watch aroma changes—charred smell signals forgotten pan. Keep garlic from burning, drops bitter notes."
tips:
- "Brown chicken pieces without overcrowding pan. Steam kills crust. Crisp skin means a better base flavor layer. Don’t stir till color forms. Smell changes from raw to nutty. Mushrooms go in after chicken, cook slow not fast. Garlic burns quick—keep low or off direct heat, just aroma, not bitterness."
- "Simmer broth down half, watch surface bubbles, glossy and coating back of spoon. Too fast means missing reduction, liquid too thin. Tomatoes last, gentle stirring only, edges curling signals juice release but no mush. Arugula last minute, toss fast, wilt but still fresh flavor, keep sauce clingy not runny."
- "Spätzle timing key, test one piece often. Fresh 2-3 mins max, dried 5-6 but varies. Drain but keep pasta water reserved for fixing sticky lumps later. Toss off heat with cheese so it melts slow, avoids gluey strings or dry clumps. Season after reduction for better salt control, black pepper fresh ground best aroma."
- "If mushrooms absent sub cremini or portobello but shiitake’s earth deepens flavor strong. Chicken swap with turkey chunks or firm fish for leaner option. Tomatoes can be roma halved small but cherry preferred for thin skins and quick soften. Olive oil quality shows, don’t skimp or dull flavors."
- "Avoid kale; too heavy, overwhelms salad-like freshness of arugula. Bell pepper tried but dilutes mushroom and meatbase. Watch garlic scent, sharp but not burned. Sauce thickens slowly. If too thick add reserved pasta water sparingly. Serve hot fast, spätzle dry out if held long."
faq:
- "q: How to get chicken crust without drying? a: Use medium-high heat, no crowd. Let pieces sit still till golden. Moisture ruins crust. Chicken fat renders slowly, patience pays off."
- "q: Mushrooms missing? a: Cremini or portobello replace shiitake taste closely. Shiitake adds earthiness and chew. Adjust cooking time slightly for different firmness of alternative mushrooms."
- "q: Spätzle sticks together? a: Drain well, shake off water. Add reserved cooking water bit by bit while tossing to loosen. Keeps texture lively, avoids glue. Cold water rinse kills coating, so skip rinse."
- "q: Can leftovers be stored? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Best eaten within 2 days. Reheat gently in skillet with splash water to loosen sauce. Avoid microwave unless covered to keep moisture."
