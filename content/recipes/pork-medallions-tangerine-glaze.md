ingredients:
- "200 ml freshly squeezed tangerine juice about 7-8 tangerines"
- "12 ml honey"
- "8 ml arrowroot powder"
- "5 ml Dijon mustard"
- "2 pork tenderloins cut into 2.5 cm thick medallions"
- "30 ml olive oil"
- "1 medium shallot minced"
- "1 small clove garlic minced"
- "30 ml olive oil for cooking shallots and garlic"
- "15 ml white balsamic vinegar"
- "15 ml orange liqueur"
- "5 sprigs fresh thyme"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Heat 15 ml olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat."
- "Season pork medallions with salt and pepper. Sear medallions 1.5 to 2 minutes per side until golden but not fully cooked. Remove from pan, set aside."
- "Lower heat to medium, add shallots and garlic to skillet. Cook 2-3 minutes stirring frequently until softened but not browned."
- "Pour in white balsamic vinegar, orange liqueur. Scrape brown bits from bottom. Let reduce 2 minutes."
- "Whisk tangerine juice, honey, arrowroot powder, Dijon mustard together in bowl until smooth."
- "Add this mixture to skillet. Stir quickly. Bring sauce to simmer and add fresh thyme sprigs."
- "Return pork medallions to pan, nestle into sauce. Cover loosely, reduce heat to low."
- "Cook gently 15 minutes, spooning sauce over medallions occasionally. Sauce will thicken, coat pork, become glossy."
- "Remove thyme sprigs. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper."
- "Serve medallions hot with pan sauce spooned over, alongside roasted baby carrots and garlic mashed potatoes."
introduction: "Pork medallions, quick sear, browned edges, tender inside. Bright tangerine-based glaze. Not cloying but sticky-sweet with tang. Orange liqueur adds a boozy depth. Fresh thyme releases subtle woodsy aroma. No butter here. Olive oil keeps it light. Sharp acidity from white balsamic, replaces heavier red wine vinegar. Garlic and shallot soften into fragrant base, no bitterness. Arrowroot powder thickens sauce transparently, nice sheen. All comes together twenty five minutes of active effort, then slow simmer with pork to infuse flavors and finish cooking. Good for weeknights, dinner guests, or anytime you want simple with a little shine. Pair with root vegetables or creamy mash. Easy to prep ahead, sauce can be made and chilled then reheated and finished with medallions. Juicy, tender, flavorful — bright but balanced."
ingredientsNote: "Tangerines vary in juice content and sweetness; adjust amount accordingly so glaze neither too thin nor too sweet. Arrowroot powder preferred to corn starch - clearer sauce, more shine. Orange liqueur optional but adds dimension. Thyme sprigs can be swapped with rosemary or sage for different herbal notes. Keep shallot and garlic finely minced to avoid burning when sautéing. Use olive oil rather than butter for a lighter flavor and to avoid lactose. White balsamic vinegar milder than red wine vinegar, subtle fruitiness without overpowering acidity. Pork medallions sliced about one inch thick cook evenly without drying out. Season medallions generously but balanced so glaze shines through."
instructionsNote: "Sear pork medallions over medium-high heat to build rich caramelized crust; don’t crowd pan or they’ll steam. Remove promptly to avoid overcooking. Use same pan to sautée shallots and garlic for flavor layers. Adding liquids directly to pan deglazes, releasing browned fond, builds sauce base. Whisk arrowroot powder with liquids separately to prevent clumping before adding; arrowroot thickens quickly so simmer sauce only briefly after adding. Add fresh thyme early in simmer to infuse but remove before serving or leaves turn bitter. Lower heat for final simmer to gently cook pork through while glazing; avoid boiling or sauce will become gluey. Spoon sauce over pork periodically to coat fully. Adjust salt and pepper last since glaze components have natural sweetness and acidity that mask flavors otherwise. Serve immediately for best gloss and texture."
tips:
- "Choose fresh tangerines. Juice varies a lot. Adjust glaze thickness. Use enough honey for sweet but balanced flavor. Arrowroot is key. Clear sauce, better sheen."
- "Sear pork just right. Medium-high heat, quick method. About 1.5 to 2 minutes per side. Build a nice crust, avoid steaming. Don’t crowd the pan."
- "Thyme is aromatic but can get bitter. Add it early. Remove sprigs before serving. Or switch to rosemary or sage. Different flavors, same method."
- "Whisk arrowroot with liquids first. Prevent clumps in sauce. Arrowroot thickens fast, adjust cooking time. Simmer minimally after adding, less is more."
- "Season to taste wisely. Salt and pepper added at end. Glaze is sweet and tangy; flavors mix. Simple adjustments make a big difference."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other juices? a: Sure, orange juice works. But flavors differ. Cranberry or lemon for tang? Play around, mix them."
- "q: Can I prep ahead? a: Yes, make glaze first. Store, refrigerated up to two days. Reheat before adding medallions. Simple prep for guests."
- "q: What if sauce is too thick? a: Add a splash of stock. Or a little water. Thin out gradually. Adjust flavors after. Easy to fix."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in an airtight container. Lasts about three days. Reheat gently on stove. Avoid high heat, keeps texture."
