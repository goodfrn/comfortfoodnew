ingredients:
- "VINAIGRETTE"
- "55 ml (just under 1/4 cup) extra virgin olive oil"
- "50 ml (3 1/2 tbsp) sherry vinegar"
- "25 ml (1 2/3 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) whole grain mustard"
- "Zest finely grated from 1 lime"
- "Salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste"
- "SALAD"
- "1.9 liters (about 7 1/2 cups) yellow beans, trimmed and blanched"
- "350 ml (1 1/2 cups) cherry tomatoes, halved"
- "450 ml (1 3/4 cups) baby rocket leaves"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) fresh coriander roughly chopped"
instructions:
- "VINAIGRETTE"
- "1. Grab a medium bowl. Whisk olive oil, sherry vinegar, and maple syrup vigorously—watch the glossy emulsion start taking shape. Add whole grain mustard for grainy texture, lime zest for brightness."
- "2. Season here; salt builds flavor, pepper gives bite. Taste—adjust acidity or sweetness if necessary. You want balanced tang, not overpowering sour or syrupy."
- "SALAD"
- "3. Beans need sharp timing; blanch in boiling salted water till snap-just-tender—about 3 minutes. You’re looking for a vibrant yellow-green contrast, with a satisfying bite. Shock immediately in ice water to halt cooking—preserves color and crunch."
- "4. Drain well, lay on clean towel to dry. Excess water ruins vinaigrette from sticking."
- "5. In large bowl, toss beans with halved cherry tomatoes and baby rocket. Tomatoes should burst under gentle squeeze, releasing juice but intact enough to offer sweetness and acidity."
- "6. Fold chopped coriander into salad. Adds fresh herbal counterpoint; swap for basil for gentler earthiness or mint for cooling twist."
- "7. Dress salad lightly to start; you can always add more. Ensure every bite gets vinaigrette but salad doesn’t swim in it."
- "8. Give final toss; pause to check seasoning. A pinch of flaky salt on top can elevate all elements. Serve immediately or room temp."
- "Tips and tricks: Mustard seeds toasted beforehand lend nuttier crunch if you prefer texture play. If short on coriander, add finely chopped fresh parsley or tarragon for aromatic complexity. If maple scarce, agave or light honey works but watch sweetness adjusted to your taste."
- "Common pitfalls: don’t overcook beans—they turn mushy fast and lose color. Let beans dry well after blanching or vinaigrette slides off. Be cautious with lime zest amount; too much bitter pith ruins delicate balance."
- "Efficiency: use a wide colander to blanch beans all at once. While they cool, make dressing. Multitasking sharpens timing and keeps beans crunchy and salad fresh."
introduction: "Yellow beans. Bright sun in pod form. Worth the slightly unusual veg hunt—so crisp, sweet. Tried green beans but they overshadow subtlety here. Rocket peppery and fresh, pairs like best friends with yellow haricots. Tomatoes add juicy breaks, color contrast sharpens senses. Vinaigrette tang brings it all alive, lime cuts richness. Maple syrup sneaking in sweetness—not cloying, just balancing acidic punch. Sometimes I swap coriander for a handful of basil or parsley, depending what’s hanging around. No nuts, no dairy, no gluten fuss. Quick, 10 minutes prep but packed with sensory rewards. Visual pop, snap of beans under teeth, zing of vinaigrette, herbal brightness lingering. Meals don’t always need heavy lifting. This one—light but textured, lively, straightforward."
ingredientsNote: "Yellow beans are key, look for fresh vibrant pods, avoid limp or overly thick stalks. Blanch fresh not frozen for best snap and color. Coriander fresh, since it’s potent and can dominate—can swap with parsley or basil according to preference. Sherry vinegar chosen for its nuttiness and depth; white wine vinegar works fine in pinch. Maple syrup for sweetness but agave or mild honey substitutes fine; adjust quantities by eye and palate. Whole grain mustard adds texture and slight sharpness; Dijon could replace but loses crunch. Cherry tomatoes ripe but firm, so they hold shape partially. Rocket baby leaves soft but peppery; if strong, toss less or add milder spinach or arugula. Olive oil quality matters—choose earthy, grassy extra virgin for best mouthfeel."
instructionsNote: "Don’t rush blanching beans—test their snap visually and tactilely during cooking; no mush. Shock immediately in ice water—this stops cooking instantly, keeps color vivid. Drain and pat dry thoroughly; wet beans dilute vinaigrette and cause salad to slip. Vinaigrette whisked vigorously until emulsified creates silkiness that coats beans evenly here. Mustard seeds or whole grain mustard included not just for heat but texture contrast and bursts of sharp flavor inside dressing. Toss salad gently; overmixing bruises tomatoes and rockets leaves, risks bitterness from bruised greens. Dress lightly—can always add more but can’t take back overdressing. Final seasoning always needs check—vinegar and lime can vary in acid strength batch to batch, so tweak salt and pepper accordingly. Use fresh lime zest only—dried zest tastes dull and bitter. Make ahead possible to an extent but toss at last minute so greens stay crisp and beans firm."
tips:
- "Blanching beans right matters—snap test visually and by bite, no mush, vibrant green-yellow color pops when shocks ice cold water. Stops cooking instantly. Don’t skip drying, wet beans kill vinaigrette emulsifying, makes salad soggy."
- "Vinaigrette texture needs vigorous whisking—olive oil plus sherry vinegar plus maple syrup emulsify into glossy coating for beans. Mustard seeds add crunch, grainy texture inside dressing. Lime zest not just flavor but brightness dimension. Adjust acid with vinegar and lime carefully."
- "Tomatoes ripe but firm works best. Squeeze gently to coax juice without turning tomatoes mushy. Rocket’s pepper edge sharp but not overwhelming; can cut with spinach or baby arugula if too strong. Coriander swaps well for basil or parsley—different herbal notes but fresh punch remains."
- "Mustard seeds toasted ahead give nuttier crunch than whole grain mustard. Maple syrup sweetness balances acidity; alternatives like agave or mild honey need careful taste check. Whole grain mustard provides slight sharpness and texture contrast in vinaigrette."
- "Final seasoning has to be spot on—vinegar acidity and lime zest vary batch to batch, salt-pinch lifts all flavors but overdosing ruins balance fast. Toss salad gently; bruised tomatoes or rocket leaves bring bitterness. Dress lightly at first; add more if needed, no drowning salad."
faq:
- "q: How to know when beans are done? a: Snap test is main guide. Bright color change too. No mush, bite still firm with resistance. Boil just 3 minutes max. Ice water shock stops cook. Overcooking turns limp, dull colored beans."
- "q: Can I replace maple syrup with something else? a: Yes, agave or mild honey works—watch sweetness level carefully. Maple has subtle flavor, alternatives less complex so adjust taste after mixing vinaigrette. Don’t over-sweeten or mask vinegar punch."
- "q: What if salad is watery? a: Beans not dried right after blanching. Wet beans cause vinaigrette to slide off, salad soggy. Use towel to pat dry thoroughly. Also, tomatoes releasing too much juice can be an issue; pick firmer fruit, squeeze gently only."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep vinaigrette separate if possible. Salad lasts 1 day refrigerated but leaves wilt. Beans hold crunch longer if dried well initially. Room temp okay short term but best fresh. Toss right before serving for crispness."
