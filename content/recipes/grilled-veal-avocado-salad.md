ingredients:
- "125 ml ½ cup mayonnaise"
- "15 g ¼ cup chopped chives, plus more to garnish"
- "12 ml 2 ½ teaspoons fresh tarragon leaves, plus more to garnish"
- "15 ml 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard instead of Dijon"
- "15 ml 1 tablespoon lemon juice"
- "4 bone-in veal chops or medallions about 1 ¾ cm ⅝ in thick"
- "2 medium red beets peeled and thinly sliced on mandoline"
- "30 ml 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 bunch arugula instead of Boston lettuce, washed and dried"
- "2 ripe avocados peeled, halved, sliced"
- "50 g ⅓ cup roasted pumpkin seeds instead of ¼ cup"
- "Optional twist: sprinkle with toasted pine nuts for nutty flavor"
instructions:
- "=== Herb Mayonnaise ==="
- "Pulse with immersion blender or food processor the mayo, chopped chives, tarragon leaves, whole grain mustard, lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve half in refrigerator; use other half immediately."
- "=== Grilling Prep ==="
- "Preheat barbecue grill on high. Oil one side of grill grate thoroughly—helps prevent sticking and promotes those grill marks we want."
- "Smear roughly 25 ml 1 ½ tablespoons herb mayonnaise over veal. Salt and pepper directly on the meat. Set aside while grill gets hot."
- "=== Beet Packets ==="
- "Lay two large sheets of foil on counter. Place thin beet slices in center. Drizzle olive oil, season with salt and pepper. Fold foil tightly to trap steam (creates mini steamer)."
- "=== Cooking ==="
- "Flip grill heat to low on one half, keep other half high and oiled. Place foil beet packets on low side, close lid. Steaming beets for 10-12 minutes until tender to fork—not mushy. You want bite but cooked through."
- "Simultaneously grill veal on hot side, 4-5 minutes each side for medium-rare. Look for juices rising on surface; meat firm but springy when pressed. Avoid piercing to keep juices in."
- "Remove veal from heat; cover loosely with foil. Rest meat minimum 5 minutes. Resting traps juices making veal juicy, not dry."
- "Remove beets carefully—steam releases hot air, don’t burn fingers."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Slice rested veal thinly off the bone. Place arugula on plates, fan sliced avocado. Scatter beet slices over arugula. Arrange veal on top."
- "Drizzle reserved herb mayonnaise in ribbons over all. Sprinkle with roasted pumpkin seeds and if desired pine nuts. Garnish with chopped chives and tarragon leaves."
- "Serve immediately. The contrast of warm veal and cool salad works well; textures of creamy avocado, nutty seeds, earthy beets, peppery greens perfect."
- "=== Notes and Tips ==="
- "If no grill work with heavy skillet or grill pan. High heat critical for that crust on veal."
- "If beets too firm add a few more minutes; too soft means overcooked—next time slice thinner."
- "Mayonnaise can be made a day ahead; flavors intensify overnight. Store airtight."
- "Avocados ripen at different rates; if underripe let sit at room temp a day or two before slicing."
- "Pumpkin seeds swap toasted sunflower seeds or pepitas if unavailable."
- "Whole grain mustard adds texture and mild tang but Dijon works too—personal preference."
- "Avoid over-oiling grill; excess smoke and flare-ups ruin veal."
- "To check doneness press center of chop with finger—soft means rare; slightly firm medium-rare, firm over medium."
introduction: "Veal grill sizzle fills air; darker spots mean caramelized meat, something a pan won’t quite nail. Tried baking alongside beets once; dull tradeoff—grill brings fire aroma you want. Beets steamed in foil trap moisture, makes slicing easier, and keeps vivid red color intact. Avocados add buttery creaminess contrasting the beet’s earthiness and crisp arugula leaves with pepper bite. Seeds tossed in for crunch, because texture adds life. Mayonnaise with herbs not just sauce but punch of brightness and aroma you want to see on plate. Timing? Watch meat color, feel it, don’t just look at clock. Flavours build better when resting. That wait? Worth every second alongside glass of chilled dry white."
ingredientsNote: "Mayonnaise base simple but herb choice critical—tarragon adds subtle licorice notes not overpowering—use fresh when possible. Chives for mild onion crunch, can sub with scallions in pinch. Whole grain mustard texture gives bursts rather than flat heat, Dijon also fine. Swap Boston lettuce to arugula bring pepper bite to balance creamy avocados and sweet beets. Pumpkin seeds toasted to bring deep nutty flavor; sunflower seeds or hemp seeds work if allergies. Thin slices of beet key to quick steaming; thick slabs take forever. If foil not handy, use a covered heat-resistant dish to steam. Avocados must be ripe—too green and overpowering bitterness shows. Experiment tossing toasted pine nuts for a subtle twist, or crumble feta for tanginess if you want dairy."
instructionsNote: "Herb mayo smooth but not too runny; consistency helps cling to veal. Oil grill grate well—prevents sticking, saves messy tears from burnt meat. Veal thickness crucial; thinner chops cook fast but risk drying out; thicker need patience with lower heat zones. Beet packets should be tightly sealed so steam doesn’t escape; helps break down texture faster but don’t overdo or turn mush. Shift veal off heat promptly once seared to rest; juices redistribute while muscles relax—pressed meat shreds quickly and dry. Slicing veal off bone a trick; use sharp knife, hold steady. Arrange salad components with care—avocado brown spots kill aesthetics; lemon juice in mayo slows browning marginally. Scatter herbs last step to keep vibrant green pops. Whole process tight on timing, overlapping steaming and grilling is efficiency key. Meat doneness best tested by feel not clock or knife prick. Scramble instructions in head: mayo, oil grill, prep beets, mayo veal, steam, veal, rest, plate, garnish, devour."
tips:
- "Grill heat zones matter big. Hot side for searing veal, low side for steaming beets in foil. Watch color changes on meat surface; juices will start to rise before flipping. Avoid piercing meat or lose moisture. Rest veal loosely covered so internal temp evens out; traps juice inside muscle fibers. Thick chops need patience; thin ones cook fast but dry easier. Mayonnaise herb blend cling best if slightly thick, not runny; fresh tarragon and chives critical but use scallions if substitute. Lemon juice in mayo slows avocado browning slightly after plating."
- "Beet slices must be very thin. I use mandoline to speed steaming time and keep tender bite with texture. Fold foil tightly to trap steam, no gaps; otherwise, beets take longer and get dry edges. If no foil, use covered heatproof dish. Time steam 10-12 mins exactly, check fork tenderness carefully but don’t overdo or mush forms. Olive oil drizzle helps flavor and prevents sticking inside foil pouch. Add salt and pepper inside packet, seasoning penetrates through steam barely but enough. Oven steaming works if no grill but lose smoky aroma."
- "Substitutions work; Boston lettuce replaced by peppery arugula adds bite balancing creamy avocado and earthy beet. Pumpkin seeds toasted for crunch but options like sunflower or hemp work well if allergic. Whole grain mustard used instead of Dijon here; texture adds bursts of flavor not flat heat—but Dijon fine. Pine nuts toasted and sprinkled last adds mild nutty complexity but optional. Avocado must be ripe—too hard means bitter, too soft mushy. Store whole grain mustard and herbs fresh refrigerated to keep punch intense in mayo."
- "Oil grill grate well before preheating. Use a paper towel dipped in oil held by tongs, wipe grate to prevent sticking. Over-oiling causes flare-ups and smoke—avoid that mess. Grill grate condition affects browning and marks; flaky or rusty grate ruins surface. Watch for popping flare-ups near fat; move chops if flame too high or char burns fast. Multiple veal chops spaced enough on grill to avoid steaming each other. Timing varies with chop thickness; test doneness by feel. Use finger or press test: softer means rarer, firmer means more cooked."
- "Herb mayonnaise made first; half reserved. Work quickly so herbs stay vibrant green. Pulse briefly, do not over puree or mayo turns runny; consistency helps grip meat and salad better. Spread mayo on veal before grilling, salt and pepper right on meat. Use rest time of veal to steam beets simultaneously—efficiency key. Serve immediately once plated to keep contrast warm meat, cool creamy avocado, crunchy seeds, and firm but tender beets alive. Garnish herbs last to preserve color bursts. Timing flexible—watch, feel, smell, see doneness signals."
faq:
- "q: How thin should beet slices be? a: Thin enough to steam fast. Mandoline ideal. A couple millimeters max. Thicker slices take too long steam, get dry edges. Thin means tender but still hold shape, no mush. Fold foil tight, trap steam well. If thick slices, cook longer but risk losing texture."
- "q: Can I skip grilling? a: Yes, heavy skillet works. Hot pan, sear veal good crust. Oven bake less flavor, no smoke aroma. Skillet needs oil to prevent sticking; butter lettuce or arugula still fresh but miss grill char. Steam beets same. Grill preferred but pan skillet acceptable backup with less smoky notes. Adjust heat, watch doneness carefully."
- "q: My veal dries out often? a: Rest meat after sear. Meat fibers relax, redistribute juices. Overcooking main reason for dryness. Press test shows doneness: soft rare, medium slightly firmer. Keep fat on, oil grill grate, avoid piercing. Flipping once helps seal juices. Thickness matters—thin chops faster cooked, watch closely. Use marinade/mayo to add moisture layer before grilling."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Keep veal sealed wrapped in foil or airtight container, fridge up to 2 days. Beet salad separate container, avocado best fresh but if leftover, sprinkle lemon juice to slow browning. Mayo sauce in jar sealed, fridge. Reheat veal gently low heat or room temp slices to keep texture. Avoid microwaving hot; dries meat fast. Salad best fresh but chilled covered fine few hours."
