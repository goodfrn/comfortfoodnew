description: "Rich buttery cookies flecked with minty Andes candy pieces; red-tinted dough for festive cheer. Chill time essential for shape and texture. Fluffy butter base whipped with sugar then fused with peppermint essence and crushed candy. Tender crumb with crisp edges, sliced chilled logs baked till pale gold. A twist swapping granulated sugar for superfine boosts even sugar distribution. Careful folding of flour avoids toughness, scraping sides keeps dough uniform.

ingredients:
- "2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour"
- "1/4 teaspoon fine salt"
- "1 cup unsalted butter softened"
- "3/4 cup superfine sugar"
- "3/4 teaspoon peppermint extract"
- "1/2 teaspoon liquid red food coloring"
- "3/4 cup finely chopped Andes Peppermint Crumble candies"
instructions:
- "Whisk together flour and salt in a medium bowl; keep nearby."
- "In stand mixer bowl with paddle attachment, beat butter and superfine sugar medium speed for 2 1/2 minutes until light and airy; scrape down bowl and paddle once halfway."
- "Add peppermint extract plus red food coloring; beat 30 seconds to distribute color evenly - you want uniform pink, not streaks."
- "Pour half the dry mix in; mix low speed just long enough for flour to disappear into butter—avoid overmixing or dough toughens; scrape bowl and paddle again."
- "Add remaining flour; mix once more briefly until fully combined and dough starts clumping, no dry pockets."
- "Fold in Andes pieces on medium speed 30-40 seconds till evenly scattered and dough clumps into rough ball pulling from bowl sides."
- "Shape dough into a 12 by 2-inch log; wrap tightly in plastic; chill minimum 6 hours or overnight—don't skip chilling, dough will be too soft to slice if rushed."
- "Preheat oven 350°F; line sheet with parchment paper."
- "Cut chilled log into ½-inch slices, spaced 2 inches apart on sheet to allow spread."
- "Bake about 10 to 13 minutes watching edges carefully; when cookie centers appear set and edges barely turn light gold, pull out. Smell intensifies minty sweets; surface feels firm when touched gently. Overbaking brings dryness; be wary."
- "Cool cookies 5 minutes on sheet then transfer to rack to cool completely. Cookies firm up while cooling; texture crisp but tender inside."
introduction: "Butter and sugar creamed 'til pale fluff, lightly sweet with a sharp peppermint bite cutting through richness. Powdered sugar often used, but superfine sugar yields better blend into butter, no grainy bite here. Flakes of Andes peppermint crunch add bursts of cooling texture, chunks that snap as you bite, scattered throughout. Red food coloring tones dough pink, makes festive swirl—don't skimp on stirring, or uneven stripes look sloppy. Chilling the log is mandatory; rushed dough turns into sticky mess you can't slice or bake evenly. Bake 'til just barely golden on edges, will smell sharp mint with deep buttery aroma. Shortbread crumb tender, buttery melt on tongue juxtaposed with peppermint candy hit. Been there with overbaking; biscuits dry like old shoe, no need. Watch visual cues. Essential layering of steps allows dough to build structure without gluten developing harsh crumb. My trick: fold dry mix slowly, scrape frequently. Highlights tricks so many overlook. Peppermint makes these either holiday treat or after-dinner nibble; best served with coffee or hot cocoa."
ingredientsNote: "The unsalted butter's temperature critical—room temp but cool to touch, not melted or cold blocks. Too warm butter ruins structure causing greasy, flat cookies. Superfine sugar chosen for even dissolving; granulated works but grainier finish. Andes Peppermint Crunch candies sub chopped Andes mints or candy canes, though peppermint candies can dissolve quicker. Liquid red coloring blends easier than gels here; gel can clump. If no peppermint extract, vanilla extract with crushed mint leaves, but some essence needed or turn bland. Salt balances sweetness and tightens gluten network slightly; too much and cookies tough, too little bland. Flour measured spooned, not scooped, to keep tender crumb—too much flour means dense, cakey. Plastic wrap tight on log avoids freezer burn and fridge odors absorption during chilling. Parchment paper mandatory for no-stick; tried using silicone mats but cookies stick with heavy sugar crust. Refrigerate at least 6 hours; shorter leads to crumbly slices hard to bake evenly. Overnight chill best flavor melding. The candy inclusion throws texture contrast; if you like softer bites, use crushed peppermint sticks instead of Andes chunks. Red dye adds festive aroma perception visually too, but if sensitive to dyes, omit and rely on natural color. Experiment with peppermint oil intensity;"
instructionsNote: "Cream butter and superfine sugar until from dull to fluffy, stopping midway to scrape ensures every bit combines evenly. Peppermint extract mixed in next creates perfume that mercilessly spreads through dough. Food coloring requires good mixing or pink splotches will annoy. Add dry ingredients in halves to ease incorporation; mixing dry flour all at once risks overworking dough which means tough cookies, not crumbly shortbread. Regular scraping the paddle and bowl prevents dry patches and pockets of flour. Incorporate candy last on medium speed to distribute chunks without pulverizing. Form log roughly 12x2 inches so slices even thickness—measure with ruler, trust you’ll get consistent bakes. Wrap tight; chilling firms dough so slices clean, not smooshed mush. Oven at 350°F high enough to set edges but not burn. Slicing cold dough forces uniformity; soft dough breaks or smears. Place slices spaced at minimum 2 inches; watch cookies spread. Bake about 10–13 minutes but rely on sensory cues: edges whisper light gold, center looks matte, not shiny. Smell shift from sweet butter to mint signals near doneness. Overbaking produces grainy, crumbly texture. Cool briefly on tray; cookies finish setting as residual heat dissipates. Transfer to wire rack to avoid sogginess from steam. Keep stored air tight; dried out cookies lose charm fast. Tried baking directly after mixing? Disaster: dough too soft, flat cookies. Chilling critical for structure and flavor melding. Always trust feel and look over clock."
tips:
- "Butter temp crucial here - room temp but still cool. Melted or cold chunks wreck dough structure. Greasy flat cookies come from warm butter. Use superfine sugar; granulated works but not same dissolve, subtle graininess. Use liquid red dye - gels clump, uneven color. Chop Andes candy fine but not dust. Folding speed matters too fast crush candy into dust, lose crunch."
- "Chill dough log minimum 6 hours. Overnight best for flavor meld and cutting ease. Skip chilling? Dough too soft, slices smear or flatten in oven. Wrap tight in plastic wrap. Prevent fridge odors or freezer burn. Measure dough log 12 by 2 inches roughly. Consistent slices bake evenly. Cold slicing forces clean edges; no smearing or rough cracked cookies."
- "Mix dry ingredients in halves; all at once overworks dough. Overmixed flour triggers gluten toughness, gives grainy shortbread crumb. Scrape bowl and paddle often mid mixing. Candy added last, medium speed only, to scatter without pulverizing. Avoid over-mixing cookies turn dense. Visual cues key; pink streaks should disappear into uniform color. Pink spots mean poor mixing, ugly final dough."
- "Baking time watch edges not timer. Edges turn light gold first, not dark brown. Center looks matte, not shiny when done. Smell changes from sweet butter to sharp mint. Surface firm but gentle to touch. Overbake? Dry texture, crumbly, like old leather. Bake on parchment, no silicone. Sugar crust sticks on silicone mats. Space cookies minimum 2 inches or they merge during spread."
- "Cooling step critical. Cookies firm as residual heat leaves. 5 minutes on sheet then rack transfer to avoid soggy bottoms from trapped steam. Store airtight or they stale quick. Candy chunks provide crunch contrast to buttery crumb. If softer bites wanted, crushed peppermint sticks suit better. Vanilla extract plus crushed mint leaves swap if no peppermint extract. Salt tightens crumb slightly but not much."
faq:
- "q: Why chill dough long? a: Dough sticky if rushed. Chilling firms it up for clean slices. Also melds flavors deeper. Skip chill, cookies flatten, rough sliced edges."
- "q: Can I substitute candy? a: Andes best for crunch. Peppermint sticks softer, melt faster. Candy canes work but can dissolve unevenly. Adjust folding time to avoid pulverizing chunks."
- "q: How to avoid tough shortbread? a: Don't overmix flour after adding. Fold gently. Scrape bowl often so dry mix fully but no excess gluten developed. Butter temp matters too; too warm = greasy texture."
- "q: Best storage method? a: Airtight container room temp few days. Freeze for long term; thaw gently. Avoid fridge unless airtight; dries cookies fast. Let cookies cool fully before storing."
