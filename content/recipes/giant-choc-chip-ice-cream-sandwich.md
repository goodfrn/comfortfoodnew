slug: "giant-choc-chip-ice-cream-sandwich"
description: "Big choc chip cookies sandwiching creamy ice cream. Brown sugar swapped for demerara; mayo replaced by Greek yogurt — tangier, cleaner texture. Butter vs oil, tried both; yogurt wins. Vanilla and mint chip ice creams bounce together, not too sweet, fresh cool bite. Baking at 175 C, not 180, kinder heat, edges crisp but center chewy and yielding. Rest cookies fully; ice cream soft enough to spread but not melt. Chill 7 to 9 hours makes a set that slices firm, melts slower. A quick 10-minute warm knife slide helps neat slices. Watch those cookie edges, golden but not blazing — crackle signals dry, no-go. May skip tins, shape dough freeform on parchment — rustic, deeper cookie flavor. The swap and tricks keep this from turning gummy or icy."

ingredients:
- "=== Cookies ==="
- "165 g (1 1/4 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "3 ml (1/2 tsp) baking powder"
- "2.5 ml (1/2 tsp) baking soda"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "180 g (3/4 cup) demerara sugar"
- "60 g (1/4 cup) white sugar"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) Greek yogurt plain"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) vanilla extract"
- "2 eggs"
- "180 g (1 cup) semi-sweet chocolate chips"
- "=== Filling ==="
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) vanilla bean ice cream softened"
- "400 ml (1 2/3 cups) mint chip ice cream softened"
instructions:
- "=== Cookies ==="
- "Set rack center oven, preheat to 175 C (350 F). Butter and line two 20 cm (8 in) springform pans, parchment on base only. Why springform? Straight edges help sandwich layers press later."
- "Whisk together flour, baking powder, soda, salt in medium bowl; aerates and evens rise. Dry leaveners critical; measure accurately. Too much soda, bitter taste."
- "In separate large bowl, beat sugar, demerara and white, with Greek yogurt, vanilla slowly. Yogurt tang cuts sweetness and moistens better than mayo I found — mayo masks flavors if overused."
- "Break in eggs one at time, beat until mixture pale, homogeneous but thick. Scrape sides. Overmixing gluten means tougher cookies; under mix, uneven texture."
- "Fold in dry mixture gently, then chocolate chips. Give about a minute folding, stops over development but brings dough together."
- "Divide batter between pans, smooth top with spatula; thick batter, dense pockets of chips visible. Tap pans lightly on counter to release bubbles, settle dough evenly."
- "Bake about 28-30 minutes—look for edges golden brown, surface slightly cracked but not too dry, center still soft when lightly pressed. Crackling edges mean overbaked. Oven temps vary, watch closely last 5 minutes."
- "Cool completely in pans on wire rack, 1 hour or more. Removing too soon risks breakage; cookies soften as warm, firm up fully cooled. No skipping this."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Once cool, release cookie sides from pans. Clean pans, dry completely. Place one cookie upside down in mold."
- "Scoop about 50 ml ice cream alternately vanilla and mint chip, spread promptly with offset spatula forming even layer - no gaps or air pockets. Firm but pliable ice cream is key, too softened melts, too firm tears cookies."
- "Top with second cookie, press gently but evenly. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap, freeze 7-9 hours minimum. Overnight better, flavors meld, ice cream solidifies without crystal formation."
- "=== Serving ==="
- "Remove from freezer 15 minutes before slicing. Run sharp knife blade under hot water, dry, cut sandwich in wedges. Warm knife glides cleanly, no crumbling. Serve immediately. Leftovers rewrap airtight freeze well up to 2 weeks."
- "=== Variations & Tips ==="
- "Butter can substitute Greek yogurt, but reduces tang and slightly denser crumb. Mayonnaise avoided to let chocolate shine. Using mint chip adds fresh zip; swap for caramel swirl or coffee ice cream for adult twist."
- "If no springform, line cake pans tightly with foil and parchment for lift-out ease."
- "On humid days, chill dough before baking to avoid spreading too much."
- "Cookie crumb too dry? Next try add 1 tbsp milk or swap half yogurt to sour cream for more moist batter."
- "If edges brown too fast while baking, cover loosely with foil midway to prevent burning."
- "Store leftover sandwiches in airtight container or cake dome – freezer prevents ice crystals ruining texture."
introduction: "Cookies thick as giants, choc chips peeking through dough nearly spread soft but holding shape. Mayonnaise? Tried. Swapped for Greek yogurt — better tang, less weight overall. Sugar mix shifts to demerara for richer caramel notes; white sugar keeps lightness. Mint chip ice cream alongside classic vanilla, contrasts cold and fresh against dense, chewy cookie. Baking at 175 C prevents gritty edges; undisturbed air bubbles rise properly — no flat bricks here. Cooling fully: critical. Ice cream sandwich slices smooth only after rest, not rushed. Knife warmed in hot water, otherwise crumb shatters. Tried freeform cookie drops, liked rustic, but springform pans keep layers tidy, easier to press. My kitchen hums with aromas of rich chocolate and sweet spices mingled with creamy cold bites waiting. Cooking’s about sensory vigilance — watch colors, listen for crackle. Feel texture under finger press. A dance between solid and soft."
ingredientsNote: "Flour blend precise; all-purpose unbleached preferred for balance between tenderness and structure. Baking powder and soda act together: powder for rise, soda for browning and tang—don’t confuse, too much soda bitter. Salt balances sweetness and brings out chocolate flavor. Demerara sugar adds deep molasses undertones; white sugar keeps cookie from being too dense. Tried mayo for moisture (sounds weird, yes) but Greek yogurt works better, less odd aftertaste, plus protein gives better chew. Vanilla extract essential, pure always, no artificial. Eggs bind and lift. Chocolate chips semi-sweet for balance; milk chips run too sweet here. Ice creams softened makes spreading easier; too cold tears cookie edges, too warm melts too fast, sloshy mess. Swap vanilla for coffee if you want sophisticated edge. Mint chip evens out candy notes with cool punch. Use chilled dough if batter too loose to avoid cookie spreading too far."
instructionsNote: "Starting with oven preheated to 175 C ensures gentle heat throughout. Greasing and lining pans prevents crumbly mess when unmolding. Mixing dry ingredients evenly distributes leaveners; skimping here or careless measuring means weird rise or holes. Creaming sugars with yogurt and eggs creates airy, moist dough; overbeat and you'll tighten gluten, resulting toughness. Folding in dry mix and chips must be gentle; overmix and cookies flat and hard. Baking time depends on your exact oven—watch edges golden, and surface cracked but not dried out. Do not open oven door early to avoid collapse. Cooling fully for 1 hour at minimum lets structure solidify. Pressing sandwich carefully with spatula avoids cracks or breaks in cookie while spreading ice cream. Alternating ice cream flavors gives visual and flavor contrast. Wrap airtight, freeze at least 7 hours. Knife warming key to clean slices without breakage. Experimenting with pans — springform easiest but solution if you have none: sturdy cake rings lined tightly. Freeze leftovers tightly wrapped; temperature fluctuations create ice crystals that ruin silky texture."
tips:
- "Dough texture critical. Too warm spreads flat; chill at least an hour on humid days. That slows spreading but keeps crumb dense. Butter swapping Greek yogurt cuts tang but softens chew. Mayo? Skip. Adds aftertaste, masks chocolate. Fold chips gently — overmix flattens cookies, tough edges crack fast. Look for crackle around edges not full dry snap; overbaked means brittle, less chewy center. Baking at 175 C lowers heat stress — edges brown slower, centers stay tender. Tap pans before baking to settle bubbles; rings hold shape better than loose sheets."
- "Cooling fully is key, no shortcuts. Cookies warm? Sandwich may collapse or melt through faster. Rest one hour at least, ideally more. Ice cream softened so it spreads but stays firm. Too stiff tears cookies on assembly, too soft melts. Wrap tight and freeze minimum of 7 hours to avoid icy crystals. Overnight better. Warm knife for slicing avoids shattering edges. Run blade under hot water, dry quickly, then saw gently. No sawing scrapes breaks, no cold knife rips cookie. Use offset spatula to spread smoothly, fill gaps fast, ice cream can dry out or melt if slow."
- "Use springform pans or lined cake pans for neat edges. Freeform cookies loose edges, weaker sandwich press. Foil and parchment lining lifts out easier than wax paper. If edges brown quick, tent foil midway through bake — slows coloration, prevents bitter char. Adding sour cream halves in yogurt gives more moist crumb and tang balance. Milk in dough added if dry crumb appears after first try — one tablespoon works, no puddle. Chocolate choice matters: semi-sweet balances sugar, milk chips turn cookie sweeter, shifts final taste. Watch oven carefully last 5 minutes — oven varies; edges tell story."
- "Flour must be unbleached all purpose for right texture. Bleached flour too soft, cookies collapse. Baking powder triggers rise; soda aids browning and tang but too much bitterness lurks if overdose. Salt maintains balance, brings out chocolate. Ice cream softness texture: pipe cold vanilla thin spots, thicker in chips for layered cool hit. Mint ice cream acts like flavor punch, cuts richness, lightens density. Serve slices cold but 15 minutes out softens outer crumb. Wrap leftovers airtight or freeze solid. Temperature flips create ice crystals which ruin mouthfeel and block smooth edges."
- "If no dedicated pans, improvise. Cake rings tight with foil, parchment lined. Dough shape and thickness controlled to keep similar bake times. Rustic freeform cookies add flavor depth but fragile sandwiches. Monitor crackling noise near edges signals dryness, remove earlier if popping starts early. Baking temp drop from 180 to 175 C slows Maillard, prevents grit edges. Resting dough firm helps texture control. Ice cream flavors can swap caramel or coffee; mint chip freshens palate contrast. Knife warming is non-negotiable, saves slices from crumbling disaster."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent cookies spreading too much? a: Chill dough well, 1 hour min. Cooler hardens fat, slows melt. Use yogurt not butter only. Avoid wet spots in batter. Shape thick enough. Humid days spread worse, chill longer. Folding gently keeps pockets intact. Watch oven temp, lower heat prevents melt rush."
- "q: Can mayo be replaced and how? a: Greek yogurt best. Adds tang, moist but cleaner flavor. Mayo masks chocolate subtlety. Sour cream mix ups moisture but less tang. Butter swap works but softens crumb, less bounce. Mayo avoided here from multiple runs; strange residue."
- "q: What signals cookies done baking? a: Edges golden with slight crackle noise not harsh snap. Surface cracked, center soft to touch but not doughy. Brown too fast? Foil tent midway. Too dry? Pull early, cookies continue crisping. Oven varies, sensory check beats timer fixations."
- "q: Best way to store assembled sandwiches? a: Wrap tightly plastic wrap or foil to block air. Freeze firm at least 7 hours. Refrigerate only short time, melts quickly. Airtight container or cake dome works if cold temps steady. Avoid temp swings or ice crystals form, grainy ice cream texture emerges."
