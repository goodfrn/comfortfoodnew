ingredients:
- "=== Pita Chips ==="
- "40 ml (3 c. à soupe) olive oil"
- "8 pita breads, each cut into 6–7 wedges"
- "3 ml (½ c. à thé) smoked paprika"
- "=== Avocado Yogurt Dip ==="
- "1 ripe avocado halved"
- "15 ml (1 c. à soupe) fresh lime juice"
- "200 ml (¾ cup plus 1 tbsp) Greek yogurt plain"
- "30 ml (2 c. à soupe) chopped fresh chives"
- "1 small garlic clove minced"
- "1 ml (¼ tsp) ground cumin"
- "Salt and fresh cracked black pepper"
- "=== Garnish ==="
- "220 ml (¾ cup plus 2 tbsp) hummus"
- "200 ml (¾ cup plus 2 tbsp) peeled diced cucumber"
- "1 medium tomato seeded and diced"
- "100 ml (½ cup less 1 tbsp) crumbled sheep’s milk feta cheese"
- "25 ml (1 ½ tbsp) finely chopped green olives packed in oil"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) thinly sliced celery leaves"
instructions:
- "=== Pita Chips ==="
- "Heat oven to 175°C (350°F), place rack center. Line baking tray with parchment."
- "Toss pita wedges with olive oil and smoked paprika. Spread on tray with edges not overlapping. Roast 14 to 16 minutes till crisp and golden, listen for faint crackle when cool. Flip once halfway but gently so they don't break. Cool completely before serving. If pita too thick or chewy, slice thinner or toast longer, watch carefully to avoid burning. Olive oil will bubble and scent will fill the kitchen — sign to check."
- "=== Avocado Yogurt Dip ==="
- "Scoop avocado into bowl. Mash vigorously with lime juice; avoids browning, brightens flavor."
- "Add Greek yogurt, chives, garlic, cumin. Stir but keep some avocado texture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Avoid overmixing or dip turns pasty. Fresh garlic pungency softens after rest. If no lime, lemon works but lime gives slight floral note."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Spread hummus evenly on shallow large platter or individual plates."
- "Scatter diced cucumber over hummus; adds crunch and moist contrast."
- "Spoon avocado dip evenly atop cucumber layer, smooth gently but not flat."
- "Decorate with tomato, feta, chopped olives, celery leaves sprinkled on top."
- "Cover with plastic or plate, chill minimum 20 minutes or up to 3 hours to let flavors marry but prevent sogginess."
- "Serve chilled or room temp with pita chips alongside."
- "Reheat pita chips briefly if dipped soften or to refresh crunch. Keep garnishes dry and fresh. Celery leaves add unexpected pop and aroma; substitute with parsley or mint if preferred."
introduction: "Started with pita chips burnt on bottom, learned thinner wedges and tossing with oil first helps even toasting. Pita soaks olive oil aromas, pops in oven with light crackles, tells me when to pull. Avocado dip — balance acid with lime, garlic sharpness tempers after chilling. Greek yogurt adds bite, keeps dip light. Texture is key — rough-mashed avocado beats blender puree every time. Hummus base anchors the dish, cucumber cuts through richness. Feta crumbles with salty pop, olives bring briny notes, celery leaves surprise every bite with freshness. Easy to swap or skip feta for vegan option; olives could be capers. One time switched cucumber for radish, added mild heat. Chill steeps flavors but serve pita chips crisp hot or room temp. A go-to for dry appetizers, afternoon snack or light dinner."
ingredientsNote: "Swapped salt of celery for smoked paprika in pita chips — smoky warmth changed the profile, a personal favorite crisp layer. Important to slice pita wedges thin enough so they crisp without burning but thick enough to hold dip loads. Longer roasting times if frozen pita, adjust oven rack closer to top heat once oil bubbles and pita begins shrinking. Lime juice crucial for avocado; delays browning, brings freshness. Garlic quantity can vary; fresh minced gives bite, roasted softens. Fresh herbs flexible: chives feel onion-y, maybe swap with dill or mint if you prefer herbal brightness. For garnishes — olives black or green; feta sheep, goat or cow milk depending on taste, quantity less if salty. Celery leaves optional, but give unexpected aroma and crunch, can replace by parsley or young kale. Homemade hummus better than store-bought thickens dish; if dry, add splash of lemon or olive oil to loosen."
instructionsNote: "Hot oven important to get pita crisp but watch carefully past 12 minutes; browned edges signal done but check underside for slight blistering and dryness. Toss halfway to prevent uneven browning. Avoid overcrowding tray; pita pieces steam if too close. Avocado mash with fork, not blender — controls texture, more rustic, better dipping experience. Mix yogurt and herbs just enough to combine flavors — overmix dulls vibrancy. Assemble layers cold primed to avoid soggy chips; let dip rest in fridge 20 to 30 mins for melding but no longer or cucumber releases too much water. Garnishes sprinkled last minute keep texture bright. Pita chips served immediately or reheated briefly dry in pan or oven. If pita stale, refresh with toaster oven 3 to 4 minutes on low broil. Store leftovers separately: dip in sealed container, pita in paper bag for crispness. This layered assembly means altered ingredient order matters: hummus first creates base that stops pita from sinking in plate, cucumber adds moisture barrier, then avocado dip stands out. Celery leaf final garnish lifts aroma right before serving — don’t skip."
tips:
- "Watch pita wedges closely once oil bubbles. Oven smell changes, bread shrinks slightly. Flip halfway, gentle toss avoid breaking crisp edges. Thin slices if chewy; thicker if load dips. Parchment stops sticking. Roasting time varies if frozen pita—move rack up once scents hit to speed browning."
- "Avocado mash done by fork, not blender—keeps little chunks, better mouthfeel. Add lime juice early; slows browning plus adds bite. Yogurt mixed in last to not dilute but blend flavors. Keep herbs coarse, stir lightly so dip feels fresh, not pasty. Garlic amount tuned to taste but raw garlic softens after chilling."
- "Layer order matters. Hummus base first—stops sogginess from wet veggies. Cucumber diced small, spread thinly; adds moisture barrier and crisp contrast. Avocado on top, smoothed gently, not flat. Garnish last with tomato, feta, olives, celery leaves or parsley. Chill 20 min minimum to merge, but avoid soggy edges."
- "If dip seems too thick or dry, splash olive oil or extra lime juice. Salt is variable; feta adds salt too so season carefully. Celery leaves give surprising crunch and aroma; parsley or mint can swap but change taste. For vegan variation, skip feta or use plant-based cheese, olives remain salty bit. Radish instead cucumber adds peppery note."
- "Reheating pita—short bursts in oven or toaster oven keeps crisp. Stale pita gets brittle; refresh carefully on low broil 3-4 minutes. Store dip and chips separately; dip airtight in fridge, pita in paper to maintain dry crisp. Avoid leaving chips in dip or moisture ruins crunch fast. Assemble layers cold, serve promptly for best texture."
faq:
- "q: How to know when pita chips are done? a: Smell changes first; olive oil warming hits nose. Edges brown, listen close for faint crackle when cool. Pita shrinks little. Avoid overbaking; check underside blistering, dryness. Flip halfway so both sides crisp evenly."
- "q: Can I substitute lime juice? a: Lemon works okay, less floral, sharper. No citrus then vinegar splash fine; acidity key for avocado browning. Using no acid turns dip brown fast. Lime juice also brightens flavor, but use what you have, adjust salt after."
- "q: My dip became pasty, what went wrong? a: Overmixing breaks texture, mashed chunks lost. Fork mashing only; mix gently when adding yogurt and herbs. Fresh garlic too much or overmix kills freshness. Chill reduces garlic sharpness too. Keep rough consistency for better mouthfeel."
- "q: Best storage for leftovers? a: Dip airtight container fridge up to 1 day max. Pita chips separated in paper bag or loosely covered to keep dry, crisp. Reheat pita briefly before serving again. Dip loses freshness after long time; avoid pre-mixing if serving late."
