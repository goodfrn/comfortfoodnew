introduction: "Zucchini and sausage. Orzo and broccoli. Quick bake then broil finish. Meaty, slightly spicy, slightly sweet. Tomato sauce soaks the bottom. Meatballs hold moisture with grated zucchini mixed in, adds texture and moisture. Orzo cooks in broth, not water, salty and flavorful. Broccoli shredded so it cooks fast with orzo last minutes of simmer. Butter and parmesan melt into orzo after removed from heat, creamy finish, no cream used. Basil chopped fine gives fresh herby notes. Simple, no fuss, one pan meatballs alongside easy orzo. Ready less than an hour. Clean kitchen. Hands off except stirring or scooping. Minimal pots. Intense flavors. Bright green broccoli contrasts red sauce and golden crust on meatballs."
ingredientsNote: "Tomatoes measured from a 400 ml can, diced not crushed for chunk texture. Tomato paste reduced amount to balance acidity without overpowering. Sausage meat drained of casing, mild or spicy depending on taste. Parmesan fresh grated not pre-grated, for rich flavor and melting. Zucchini peeled or not â€“ peeling optional, grated converts hidden greens into moist addition in meatballs, helps juiciness. Chicken broth preferably low sodium to control salt levels. Orzo measured by weight for accuracy. Broccoli finely shredded to cook quickly and evenly with orzo near end of cooking. Butter unsalted for clean flavor. Added fresh basil gives earthy aroma without overpowering. Olive oil drizzle after cooking for subtle richness. Salt and pepper throughout for seasoning control. No eggs for binder, zucchini replaces moisture and binding properties. Added basil not original but gives herbal twist and color contrast."
instructionsNote: "Begin by getting oven hot to 220 C, middle rack placement for even cooking. Tomato base mixed first, salt and pepper added directly, ensures sauce flavor foundation. Meatball mixture handled lightly, do not overmix to keep texture tender. Using a 40 ml scoop ensures uniform meatball size for even cooking. Bake uncovered to allow tomato sauce to reduce slightly and evaporate excess liquid. Broil step added to caramelize and brown meatball surface for texture contrast. While baking, broth is boiled for orzo cooking. Orzo cooked just shy of full doneness at 6-7 minutes to avoid mush after broccoli addition. Broccoli stirred in last, cooks 1 to 3 minutes depending on desired texture, retains bright color and slight crunch. Removing pot from heat immediately after maximizes butter and parmesan melting without overcooking pasta. Drizzling olive oil last adds extra silkiness and flavor layer. Serving situates orzo first, meatballs and sauce spooned atop, keeping plating rustic and accessible. Salt and pepper adjustments repeated after butter and parmesan added to taste test final seasoning. Timing flexible by a minute or two at bake and boil stages with no major compromise."
tips:
- "Grate zucchini, adds moisture to meatballs. Doesn't need peeling. Helps tender texture. Can switch to yellow squash. Good for stealth veggies."
- "Use fresh herbs. Basil brightens the dish. Dried works, but not the same. Fresh gives more flavor. Swapping for oregano is fine."
- "Bake meatballs first for consistent cooking. Broil at end for color. Check internal temp if unsure doneness. 74 C is safe."
- "Cook orzo in chicken broth, adds flavor. Low sodium broth prevents oversalting. Simmer pasta until nearly tender; stop cooking to avoid mush."
- "Add broccoli at the end. Retain crunch and color. Shredded cooks fast. Larger pieces may take longer. Keep an eye on timing."

- "q: Can I modify this recipe for other veggies? a: Yes, substitute carrots or bell peppers. Just adjust cooking time. Aim for similar size pieces for even cooking."
- "q: How to serve this dish? a: Serve immediately. Orzo first then top with meatballs. Spoon sauce from bottom around. Presentation rustic, appetizing."
