instructions:
- "=== Batter ==="
- "1. Center rack in oven. Preheat to 185°C (365°F). Grease a 20 cm (8 inch) square baking dish. Set aside."

- "3. In a mixing bowl, whisk canola oil with molasses until well blended. Add egg, beat lightly. Alternate adding dry ingredients and pineapple juice into the wet mixture, folding gently until just combined. Pour batter evenly into prepared baking dish. Place dish on baking sheet to catch drips. Reserve."

- "4. Combine brown sugar, white sugar, arrowroot powder in saucepan. Slowly add cream, stirring constantly with a whisk over medium-low heat. Heat until mixture boils and thickens slightly, about 7 minutes, stirring to avoid lumps."
- "5. Remove from heat. Stir in vanilla and cinnamon. Pour sauce evenly over batter in the baking dish."

introduction: "Sugar cream pudding. Roots deep in Quebec kitchens. Simple ingredients made rich with cream and sugar. Batter thick but tender. Molasses adds earthiness, pineapple juice a subtle tang — unexpected twist. Arrowroot for smooth thickening, easier to digest than cornstarch. Vanilla and cinnamon fuse warmth in the sauce. Caramel bubbling under golden crust. Toothpick test tells the final story. Cool or warm, texture changes. Every bite dense yet melt-in-mouth. Dessert or snack at any hour. Not fancy, honest and sweet. No nuts, good for friendly plates. Embrace the messy edges, the overflow of sauce. Cozy dish for chilly days, hint of tropical angle. Scottish settler meets French Canadian through sugar and cream."
ingredientsNote: "Flour choice affects crumb; unbleached all-purpose lends sturdiness. Canola oil neutral, but swapping for melted butter deepens flavor. Molasses traded for brown sugar in origin, but here light molasses brings subtle bittersweet notes, balancing sweet cream. Pineapple juice used instead of milk to add acidity, tenderizing gluten and lending brightness. Arrowroot powder swapped for cornstarch, offering cleaner finish and glossy sauce. Brown and white sugars balance depth and sweetness. Cinnamon optional but recommended for spice hit. Vanilla extract standard but choose pure for best aroma. Cream richness anchors, never skimp on fat content, standard 35% heavy cream ensures that luscious mouthfeel. Salt pinch to cut through the sweetness. Eggs bind batter, no substitute for structure here. Adjust liquid ratios if island-type juices used."
instructionsNote: "Preheat and grease first; keep oven temperature slightly lower to prevent overbrowning with molasses present. Batter mixing is alternate wet and dry, folding gently avoids tough texture. Use whisk for sauce to avoid lumps, heating evenly on medium-low prevents scorching. Sauce thickens softly, keep stirring until visible boil and thick coat on whisk. Pour sauce while hot over batter to allow infusion into crumb during bake. Baking time crucial; too long dries pudding, too short leaves custard runny. Toothpick test reliable indicator for doneness. Cool in dish for 15 minutes minimum to set sauce layer. Serve directly, no need for plating finesse. Leftovers reheat well, sauce thickens further in fridge. Variations possible with fruit additions or extracts but add sparingly, keep original balanced. Clean pan edges with paper towel pre-baking to avoid burning sugars. A tactile kitchen task more than precise science—watch, taste, smell through process."
tips:
- "Start with preheating oven. Grease baking dish well. Key for easy removal. Watch for slight brown, not burnt. Warm oven helps batter rise nicely. Molasses may darken, so adjust temp down slightly."
- "Mix dry and wet ingredients separately. Important! Alternate additions prevent lumps. Fold batter carefully. Gently combine for tender result. Avoid overmixing as it toughens texture. Use spatula for best outcome."
- "For sauce, whisk constantly. Prevents clumping, ensures smooth sauce. Medium-low heat. Patience is crucial here. Boil just till thick. Test with whisk, should cling. Pour directly over batter while hot."
- "Baking crucial, too long can dry it out. Check toothpick at center; it should come out almost clean. Golden top means ready! Let it cool slightly to set sauce and enhance flavors."
- "Serving hints: warm or cooled, flavors deepen as it sets. Simple plating or directly from dish. Consider fruit toppings if desired, but keep balance. Creaminess with that slight tang. Ideal for any casual eat."
faq:
- "q: How do I store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container, in fridge up to three days. Can reheat gently. Sauce thickens more, might need cream splash. Watch for texture change."
- "q: Can I substitute ingredients? a: Yes, but with caution. Canola oil for melted butter changes flavor. Arrowroot possible swap but with cornstarch, different results. Adjust if using milk instead of juice."
- "q: Why did my pudding not set? a: Mixing time may cause issues. Overmix can lead to tough. Baking temp might be off. Center too cool when pulled. Try another batch with slower bake."
- "q: What variations can I try? a: Fruit could work! Berries mixed in or on top. Extracts like almond or coconut add flair. Just don’t overpower base flavors, keep it balanced."
