ingredients:
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) arrowroot starch"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) tamari or soy sauce"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) maple syrup"
- "15 ml (1 tbsp) fresh lime juice"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) curry powder"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) garlic powder"
- "400 g (14 oz) firm tofu, torn roughly into 12 pieces"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) vegetable oil"
- "180 g (2 cups) thinly shredded red cabbage"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) lime juice, plus extra for drizzling"
- "60 ml (1/4 cup) vegan mayonnaise"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) hot sauce (sriracha or similar)"
- "1 medium Fuji apple, cored and finely sliced"
- "4 soft wheat tortillas, 30 cm (12 inch) diameter"
- "2 small ripe avocados, halved and peeled"
instructions:
- "=== Slaw preparation ==="
- "Start by tossing shredded cabbage with lime juice in a large bowl. Salt lightly. Let it sit to soften and release liquid about 20 minutes. Then, drain well pressing down to squeeze out excess moisture. Important to keep slaw from watering down the wraps."
- "Mix in vegan mayo, hot sauce, and apple slices. Add fresh cracked black pepper. Set aside; flavors meld better with a little rest."
- "=== Tofu marinade and cooking ==="
- "Whisk arrowroot starch, tamari, maple syrup, lime juice, curry powder, and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper sparingly since tamari is salty. Coat tofu pieces thoroughly in marinade. Let sit a few minutes to bind flavors."
- "Heat oil over medium-high in a well-seasoned skillet. When shimmering but not smoking, add tofu and any marinade left in bowl. Sear without stirring too much—look for golden crispy edges all around, about 6-8 minutes total. Flip gently with tongs or spatula. Avoid overcrowding pan; cook in batches if needed. The sizzle and aroma tell you when tofu is done—the coating forms a crust, resistance to touch changes."
- "Transfer tofu to a cooled plate to stop cooking but retain texture."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Lay out tortillas on clean surface. Using a fork, mash half an avocado on center of each wrap. Drizzle lime juice over smashed avocado to prevent browning. Lightly season with salt and freshly ground pepper."
- "Spoon a generous layer of prepared slaw atop avocado. Then place the warm curried tofu pieces over slaw, balancing so wraps aren’t overloaded."
- "Fold two opposite sides of each tortilla towards the middle, then roll from bottom to top enrobing all contents tightly. Wrap each completed wrap in parchment paper or plastic wrap to help hold shape and for easy transport."
- "=== Notes and tips ==="
- "Arrowroot starch gives light crispiness without heaviness that cornstarch sometimes brings—works better for tofu crust. Maple syrup helps balance heat but can substitute honey or agave nectar."
- "Red cabbage slaw preferred for color and crunch over green cabbage here. Fuji apple gives a firmer sweet bite versus softer Cortland."
- "If pressed for time, marinate tofu 5 minutes minimum. Too long, arrowroot can clump—gently toss before cooking."
- "If you don’t have vegan mayo, swap light sour cream or Greek yogurt for tanginess, adjust salt accordingly."
- "Wrap tortillas briefly over low flame or in dry skillet to warm and soften, easier folding without tearing."
- "Use tortilla flour wraps or even gluten-free varieties if needed, just adjust warming time."
- "Watch tofu carefully during sear; once browned and pulling away easily with spatula, it’s done. No need for strict time."
- "For freshness, assemble wraps close to serving time to avoid sogginess. Slaw can be made ahead but avocado mash should be added just before eating."
introduction: "I never trusted tofu cooked without a good crust. Powdered starch needed—arrowroot beats corn on crispness here. Curry powder and lime juice punch up tofu’s blandness, smells get me every time. Avocado mash, that creamy bed, keeps wraps moist but not sloppy. Shredded red cabbage instead of green adds bite and color, plus Fuji apple's firmer sweetness cuts sharpness better. Mayo with hot sauce brings cooling heat. I learned the hard way: cabbage juice drips, no good. So do the draining dance or soggy wraps. A quick warm of tortillas before assembly makes folding less of a nightmare. Timing? Watch tofu should be caramel gold, no mush. Slaw softened but crunchy still. Wrap tight, slice just before eating, messiness guaranteed but worth it."
ingredientsNote: "Arrowroot starch is the key for crispy tofu without the heaviness or chalkiness cornstarch sometimes adds—don’t skip this step. Maple syrup is the gentler sweetener here; swap honey if not vegan, or agave nectar for milder sweetness. I replaced original cabbage with shredded red cabbage for better crunch and pretty purple hue but green works too. Fuji apple chosen over Cortland for firmer texture that holds shape against dressing without getting soggy. Vegan mayo keeps slaw creamy without overpowering flavor; Greek yogurt or sour cream can be alternative if desired. Hot sauce varies—sriracha precise choice, but any preferred chili paste good; skip if heat’s not your game but balance flavor with extra lime juice and a pinch of sugar. Fresh lime juice sprayed on avocado prevents browning and brightens the wrap’s taste."
instructionsNote: "Start slaw early to soften cabbage and draw out liquid, then drain well to keep wrap’s texture clean. Don’t rush tofu marinade; even a few minutes allow starch and flavor to bind. Cook tofu over medium-high heat in batches—crowding pan kills crispness; you need that sizzle sound, a high-pitched sear indicating correct temperature. Flip gently but often enough to get all sides evenly golden, about 6-8 minutes total. Tofu done signals are visual—the golden-brown crust, edges lifting from pan. If it sticks too much, heat too low or pan not hot enough. Let tofu cool slightly before assembly or it steams the slaw, making it limp. Warm tortillas before spreading avocado—room temp will tear during rolling. Fold wraps tightly, sealing ingredients in, prevents leaks. Parchment wrap helps keep shape if transported. Assemble close to serving time to avoid sogginess, smash avocado fresh to keep color bright. If wraps get watery, throw another handful of shredded cabbage or add crunch with thin chopped nuts if no allergy concerns."
tips:
- "Arrowroot starch coats tofu for crisp bite; cornstarch fails here. Coat tofu pieces evenly but not thick—thick clumps burn, thin spots stay soggy. Marinate minimum five minutes to let starch bind flavors. Toss gently before searing; clumps undo crispness. Heat pan well. Need sizzle, high pitched sear. Medium-high, no smoking. Crowding pan kills crust and smell. Flip tofu carefully, tongs or spatula, to keep golden edges intact. Visual cues are better than stopwatch."
- "Slaw needs draining. Red cabbage juices make wrap soggy fast. Toss with lime juice and salt early—wait 20 minutes. Press out excess moisture firmly but don't mush cabbage. Adding mayo and hot sauce after drainage preserves crunch. Apple slices add texture but keep firm by slicing just before mixing. Fresh cracked black pepper lifts flavors, don’t skip it. Rest slaw while tofu cooks so flavors marry bit, but don’t long; slaw softens too much if left."
- "Avocado mash must be fresh; brown spots ruin visual and flavor. Spread with fork directly on warm tortilla for slight softening. Drizzle lime juice immediately to prevent browning. Season lightly—salt and pepper only. Warm tortillas briefly over low flame or dry skillet to increase pliability but avoid drying out, tearing during rolling is common if cold. Fold wraps tight, roll bottom to top to seal. Parchment or plastic wrap keeps shape if carried around or prepped early."
- "Flavor balance depends on hot sauce and maple syrup ratio. Adjust to personal heat tolerance; sriracha preferred but chili paste or omit. Maple syrup sweetens but can swap honey or agave for different sweetness profiles. Curry powder and garlic powder quantities are subtle but crucial; overpowering either makes tofu bitter or weird. Salt sparingly because tamari is salty. Keep seasoning controlled to avoid masking avocado creaminess or apple brightness."
- "Tofu done signals rely on sight and feel. Golden crust edges lifting from pan, firm resistance, subtle sizzle stop. Don’t poke too hard or you’ll lose crust. Transfer tofu to cool plate to halt cooking; carries residual heat. Slaw wilts with steam if add tofu hot directly—wrap gets limp. Timing depends on your senses, not timers. If wraps sit before eating, add avocado fresh to keep color bright. If watery wraps appear, toss in shredded cabbage or nuts for crunch fix."
faq:
- "q: How long to marinate tofu? a: Minimum five minutes for starch binding. Longer clumps starch—needs tossing before cooking. Not marinating enough misses crisp. I let mine sit while prepping slaw."
- "q: Can I use other starch besides arrowroot? a: Cornstarch is heavier, clumps easier, less crisp crust. Tapioca works but less common. Arrowroot is light and clean—best for texture. Substitutes impact crispness a lot."
- "q: What if wrap turns soggy? a: Drain slaw thoroughly first. Liquid is culprit. Press cabbage hard after resting. Avoid adding avocado til last minute. Warm wraps help keep structure. If sogginess persists, add extra shredded cabbage or nuts. That rescue crunch helps."
- "q: Best storage method for leftovers? a: Wraps don’t keep well long term; best eaten soon. Refrigerate in airtight. Add avocado fresh after reheating wrap to avoid browning. Can freeze tofu separately but slaw and avocado lose texture. Practical approach—make slaw ahead, assemble right before eating."
