slug: "oven-risotto-leek-spinach"
description: "Oven baked risotto loaded with leeks and fresh spinach, enriched with Parmesan and ricotta. Optional Italian sausages for extra bite. Risotto cooks gently in the oven, absorbing flavors without constant stirring. Leeks softened in butter start the base, wine deglazes, then hot broth steams the rice to al dente. Spinach and cheese folded in last moment, creamy, luscious texture. Hands-off ease but watch the aroma and texture for best results. Skip sausages for veggie version or swap them for diced pancetta. A midway rich risotto twist showing why timing and layering matter here."

ingredients:
- "3 mild Italian sausages optional"
- "15 ml olive oil"
- "500 ml finely chopped leeks roughly 1 medium"
- "50 ml butter softened"
- "500 ml Arborio rice"
- "250 ml dry white wine"
- "1.2 liters hot chicken broth"
- "1.5 liters fresh baby spinach chopped or 200 g frozen spinach thawed squeezed dry"
- "250 ml grated Parmigiano Reggiano"
- "130 ml ricotta cheese OR substitute with mascarpone for creaminess"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 190C place oven rack center position."
- "Drizzle 10 ml olive oil over sausages set aside on baking dish. Reserve remainder of oil."
- "Melt 30 ml butter in large ovenproof pot over medium heat. Add leeks. Salt lightly to draw moisture. Cook stirring occasionally till softened, translucent but not browned about 5-7 mins. Smells sweet, slightly fragrant."
- "Add rice stir constantly 1-2 mins to coat grains fully with butter-leek base. Rice looks glossy, sound changes slightly. Pour wine. Stir and let reduce almost dry, wine aroma sharpens; stop when mostly evaporated."
- "Add hot broth all at once bring to boil uncovered. Season with salt, pepper. Cover with tight lid or foil."
- "Place covered pot and sausage dish in oven. Bake about 22-25 mins. Check risotto grain texture near 20 mins – should be tender yet firm, not mushy. Sausages fully cooked, firm to touch, juices clear."
- "Remove pot carefully. Stir in spinach cheese (parmigiano and butter). Spinach wilts immediately in the residual heat, risotto thickens, becomes creamy. Taste adjust salt pepper."
- "Slice sausages into rounds, scatter on risotto surface. Garnish with ricotta dollops or mascarpone dollops. Serve immediately."
- "If risotto too firm add splash warm broth stir and rest 3 mins."
- "Leftover risotto transforms beautifully into baked patties next day."
introduction: "Leek and spinach risotto baked slowly in oven? Sounds odd but it works. No need to stand and stir endlessly. I’ve tweaked ages, learned watch for juice simmering, smells changing, texture hitting that perfect chewy bite. The scent of leeks caramelizing gently in butter then wine reducing sharpens my appetite. Spinach thrown late retains vibrance and fresh taste. Used to add sausages; they bring punch but also swap with pancetta or mushroom for depth. Ricotta or better, mascarpone – richness that melts over warm grains and transforms each forkful. A dish balancing timing cues, smells, textures. Kitchen reminders not to overcook, to trust eyes and touch. Don’t forget to season well."
ingredientsNote: "Leeks – crucial for subtle sweet base. Chop fine, no limp soggy bits or bitter green tops here. Spinach – fresh best, washed well, frozen is lifeline but drain thoroughly. Arborio rice – starch holds moisture, creamy risotto key. For broth, chicken broth preferred but veg broth can replace no fuss. White wine – dry variety adds acidity, skip for more mellow, replace with extra broth and lemon zest. Butter split purposefully; initial for aroma and cook softness, last to enrich creamy texture. Parmesan sharp, packed flavor but swap with Pecorino or aged Asiago if you want edge. Ricotta or mascarpone adds smooth finish; ricotta lighter but mascarpone richer, great for decadent feel. Sausages optional; for veggie leave out or use smoky tofu. Olive oil used sparingly for roasting sausages but can swap with grapeseed oil."
instructionsNote: "Start with softened leeks in butter; keep stirring to prevent burning but watch for translucency not color—sharp bitterness if darkened. Never rush rice coating stage; wine evaporation is key for concentrated flavor and prevents raw taste. Using hot broth straight from kettle or microwave brings steady cooking, avoids cooling risotto. Cover tightly to lock steam; trap heat, cook rice evenly without drying. Oven temp fluctuates; check texture near 20 mins rib tasting grain for firm center. Sausage cooking times vary by size; check internal temperature or cut to ensure no pink. Stir in spinach off heat to keep green bright, melt cheese last step for creamy consistency—avoid over mixing ricotta or it loses texture. Serve immediately; risotto waits for no one."
tips:
- "Softened leeks in butter need patience. Stir often to avoid dark spots that bring sharp bitterness. Watch translucency; it’s subtle. Timing- 5 to 7 mins, smells sweet, not browned. Chop fine but no limp stray bits. Texture matters for flavor base."
- "Coat rice well in butter-leek mixture before adding wine. Stir constantly here for gloss, slight sound change in pan, rice grain looks shiny. Wine evaporation is critical. Let reduce almost dry then stop. Raw wine taste ruins texture later."
- "Use hot broth straight from kettle or microwave; cold broth shocks rice, slows cooking, breaks texture. Pour all at once. Bring to boil uncovered to adjust salt and pepper properly. Cover tight after to lock steam, cook grains evenly. Steam is your friend here."
- "Check doneness at 20 minutes by tasting grain center. Should be firm but tender; mushy is overdone, crunchy is undercooked. Oven temps vary, so rib test vital. Stir risotto off heat when adding spinach and cheese; maintain vibrant green and creamy finish without breaking fibers."
- "If risotto feels too dense after baking, add splash of warm broth, stir lightly, then let rest off heat 3 minutes. It softens texture without watering down. For swap options, sausages switch to smoky tofu or pancetta. Butter split purposefully: first for softening, last for richness layering."
faq:
- "q: Why no constant stirring here? a: Oven cooking replaces stirring. Steam heats evenly, rice cooks gentle. Saves work but watch texture. Stir spinach and cheese only at end or lose texture."
- "q: Can I skip wine? a: Yes. Replace wine with extra broth plus lemon zest to add brightness. Wine cuts starch flavor, but not mandatory. Dry white preferred but stock works fine too."
- "q: What if risotto is too dry or tough? a: Add warm broth splash then rest 3 mins. Help grains absorb moisture. Oven heat dries surface; broth rescue needed. Avoid overbaking. Timing check with grain bite crucial."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Risotto firms up. Reheat with splash water or broth, stir gently. Baked patties next day work well. Freeze not ideal; texture shifts, but they hold if thawed well."
