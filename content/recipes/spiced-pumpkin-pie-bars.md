slug: "spiced-pumpkin-pie-bars"
description: "Pumpkin bars with a buttery crumbly crust and a spiced pumpkin custard filling baked in two stages. Uses evaporated milk for creaminess, plus warm spices and cornstarch for texture. Chilled overnight to set firm enough for slicing. A buttery crust that browns lightly, soft but not sticky dough requiring gentle handling. Filling thickens with visual cues, jiggly then firm edges. Oven temperature tweaking to set custard without overbaking. Whipped cream topping optional but recommended."

ingredients:
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter softened"
- "1/2 cup brown sugar packed"
- "1 large egg yolk"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 cup all-purpose flour"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1 cup pumpkin puree"
- "2 large eggs"
- "2/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "2 tbsp cornstarch"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp cinnamon"
- "1/2 tsp ground ginger"
- "1/4 tsp nutmeg"
- "1/4 tsp allspice"
- "3/4 cup evaporated milk"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 355°F. Line 8×8 inch light aluminum pan with parchment, leave edges hanging for lift out."
- "In mixer, cream softened butter and packed brown sugar until fluffy but not greasy, about 2–3 minutes. Scrape bowl sides to avoid uneven mixing."
- "Add egg yolk and vanilla extract. Blend just till combined."
- "Fold in flour and salt. Don’t overwork. Dough will crumble but should hold when pressed. If sticky, dust fingers lightly with flour."
- "Press dough evenly into pan bottom. Use wax or parchment paper on top and palms to smooth without sticking. Edges slightly higher to catch filling spills."
- "Bake crust for 17–22 minutes. Edges golden light brown; center set but still soft. Let cool until warm but not hot to touch."
- "Mix pumpkin filling: whisk pumpkin, eggs, sugar, cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice in large bowl. Pour in evaporated milk last and blend fully. Chill in fridge until crust cools."
- "Pour filling over warm crust. Tap pan gently to eliminate bubbles and level surface."
- "Increase oven temp to 430°F. Bake 13–17 minutes till edges bubble, center slightly jiggly. Immediately lower oven back to 355°F."
- "Continue baking another 48–55 minutes until filling is mostly set and lightly puffed. Center will firm but retain slight wobble when nudged. Avoid overbaking to prevent cracking."
- "Remove from oven. Cool fully at room temp — smells like pumpkin spice heaven. Cover and refrigerate at least 4 hours, overnight better for clean slices."
- "Lift bars from pan using parchment edges. Cut into 9 squares. Serve cold with whipped cream or toasted pecan sprinkle."
introduction: "Pumpkin bars — nostalgia on a tray. Not just pie filling slapped on crust; this needs a tender touch. The crust isn’t overly sweet, just buttery crumbs that hold the soft, spiced custard. Pumpkin’s richness, balanced with spices, eggs, and evaporated milk for a velvety sheen. Two-oven temps and care in baking times to avoid cracking or a rubbery texture. Been burned by undercooked centers before — that wobble is your friend, not enemy. Chilling is key; when bars come out clean and firm. No rushing this. Whipped cream melts under leftover heat — always a fight at my place."
ingredientsNote: "Butter at room temp; cold butter makes crumbly dough impossible to mix well. Sugar choice matters — brown sugar gives depth, but white works if you want cleaner sweetness. Egg yolk adds richness and tenderness; don’t swap whole eggs unless you want crust denser. Flour should be measured properly — spoon and level to keep crust light. Pumpkin puree: canned is fine, fresh pumpkin can vary in moisture so reduce milk a touch if fresh. Spices are what bring the fall aroma. Adjust to your liking but start small to avoid overpowering pumpkin’s delicate sweetness. Evaporated milk — don’t swap with cream or regular milk as it alters texture drastically. Cornstarch is silent hero — stabilizes filling, prevents soggy crust. Salt a must in both dough and filling sets flavors apart."
instructionsNote: "Oven temp control is vital. Start low-medium for crust to avoid burning edges while leaving center raw. Crust sets and browns just right — golden edges with pale center is good. Keep parchment for easier cleanup and bar removal, no scraping the pan bare. Dough consistency matters. Too soft? Chill briefly before pressing. Too sticky? Light flour or wax paper trick to avoid hands smeared in butter. Filling mix should be smooth but not beaten into foam — too much air causes cracking. Pour into warm but not hot crust, so filling adheres well. First bake at high temp gets edges firm, hold shape. Then lower temp to prevent overcooking while filling finishes setting. Watch the jiggle — a tiny wobble in center is good. Chill long enough to let custard firm. Cutting warm bars leads to messy slices. Use serrated knife, wipe clean between cuts. Whipped cream or pecans add texture contrast, but crumbs hold the day here."
tips:
- "Butter at room temp for dough that binds but stays tender; cold butter ruins crumb structure and makes pressing messy. Brown sugar adds moisture and depth; swap with white sugar for less richness but flatter flavor. Flour – scoop then level; no shaking cup or dough gets tough. Use wax paper over dough before smoothing; avoids greasy hands sticking and keeps edges neat. If dough’s sticky, dust hands lightly with flour; don’t add too much or crust toughens."
- "Watch the crust bake: edges turn golden first, center stays pale then sets firm but soft to touch. Crust too brown? Oven temp too high; lower it next time. Use parchment paper for no cleanup and easy lift-out. Removing bars cold sharpens slices; warm cuts crumble. Chilling overnight lets filling firm up, that wobble in center early bake means good set, not underdone. Whipping or folding filling too much traps air leads to cracking. Mix smooth but still dense."
- "Pumpkin filling thickens slowly; cornstarch is silent stabilizer. Mix last ingredient evaporated milk gently; too vigorous mixing causes air bubbles and cracks. Pour filling warm crust not piping hot or custard won’t set right. Double oven temps: start high to set edges, then lower to finish softly. Don’t skip this step or edges burn or custard rubbery. Tap pan after pouring to release air pockets; helps smooth surface and even bake."
- "Spice measurements are just suggestions; adjust carefully. Too much cinnamon or ginger overpowers pumpkin’s subtle sweetness; start small, taste batter (eggs raw) cautiously. Salt in dough and filling crucial—not just seasoning but balancing sweetness. If fresh pumpkin, reduce evaporated milk slightly due to moisture variability. Filling jiggly at first bake means it’s setting; hold back on panic to avoid cracking from overbaking."
- "Cutting bars cold prevents crumbling; use serrated knife wiping clean between cuts. Parchment edges help lift bars cleanly from pan without breaking crust. Whipped cream or toasted pecans optional for texture contrast but bars hold shape well solo. If crust shrinks in pan next time chill dough before pressing or handle less; sensitivity matters for soft dough. Bake times vary per oven, use visual cues more than strict minutes."
faq:
- "q: Why does crust get tough sometimes? a: Usually flour overwork or too cold butter. If dough too warm gets sticky, but too much flour makes crust dense. Rest dough briefly if sticky. Chill helps settle gluten so less chew."
- "q: Can I swap evaporated milk? a: No real substitute without changing fill texture. Regular milk thins mixture, cream too rich changes set. Some tried half and half but loses firm custard feel. Use canned evaporated or it’s different result."
- "q: Filling cracks after baking? a: Overbaking biggest cause; wait till edges bubble, center jiggles slightly then lower temp or time. Too much air bubbles from whipping also crack. Pour gently, tap pan to release bubbles."
- "q: How long keep bars stored? a: Refrigerate covered, up to 4 days best. Freeze possible but texture takes hit, crust soggier after thaw. Let warm slightly before serving if frozen cold makes custard rubbery."
