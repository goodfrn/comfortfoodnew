ingredients:
- "1 lb chicken breast tenderloins"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 tbsp fresh lemon juice"
- "2 garlic cloves minced"
- "1 tsp dried oregano"
- "1 tsp dried thyme"
- "1/2 tsp smoked paprika"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper"
- "1 package refrigerated crescent roll dough (8 rolls)"
- "4 tbsp hummus"
- "4 tsp crumbled feta cheese"
- "4 tsp chopped kalamata olives"
- "4 tsp sun-dried tomatoes (oil-packed, drained and chopped)"
- "PAM or vegetable spray for baking sheet"
- "Italian parsley for garnish"
instructions:
- "Heat oven to 380 degrees F. Foil-line rimmed baking sheet; spray thinly with oil."
- "Warm olive oil in pan over medium heat till shimmery. Toss in garlic; stir 30 seconds till fragrant."
- "Add chicken tenderloins seasoned with oregano, thyme, paprika, salt, pepper. Sizzle, listen for steady gentle bubbling. Adjust heat to cook chicken evenly. Flip after 3-4 minutes. Pour lemon juice over chicken mid-cook. Chicken done when firm, opaque, or internal temp hits 160F minimum, resting to 165F. Remove from pan; set on plate."
- "Unroll crescents gently on floured surface; roll out each one wider and thinner without tearing. Fragile dough needs light hands."
- "Spread about 1/2 tsp hummus on each flattened crescent – a thin veil, not soaked."
- "Layer 1/2 tsp feta, 1/2 tsp chopped olives, 1/2 tsp finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes on hummus. Cut chicken tenders lengthwise if thick; add ~1 tsp pieces per crescent. Avoid overloading or dough breaks."
- "Roll crescents tightly but without squeezing filling out. Seal edges with fingertip dampness if needed."
- "Arrange rolls spaced apart on baking sheet. Spray tops lightly with oil or egg wash for browning boost."
- "Bake 16-18 minutes. Look for edges crisp, golden brown spots forming. Tap lightly, should sound hollow-ish. Avoid soggy bottoms by not overcrowding pan."
- "Let rest 2-3 minutes; filling settles, easier to handle."
- "Serve warm. Extra hummus on side. Sprinkle with fresh parsley for color, aroma."
introduction: "Mediterranean flavors in buttery crescent dough. Chicken tenderloins cooked gently in olive oil mingling with fresh lemon, garlic, oregano, and thyme. Hummus adds a creamy barrier so dough doesn't get soggy. Feta, olives, and sun-dried tomatoes punch up the salty tang. Crispy edges and golden brown tops make it irresistible. Been there, done that with soggy bottoms, ended up tweaking dough handling and hummus layering. Turns out the thin spread is key. The rolling out crescents step always makes me nervous - that dough tears too fast or stays too thick. Patience and light hands pay off big. The bake time varied by a few minutes on each try, and smelling nutty butter with lemon zing is my doneness gauge now. With substitutions and modest ingredient switches, this adapts well for what’s on hand or dietary tweaks."
ingredientsNote: "Chicken tenderloins are best for even cooking and quick sear. Boneless skinless thighs work but adjust cook time due to fat; they bring juiciness but can make filling oily. Kalamata olives can be swapped for green olives or capers for a different briny note. Feta is critical for salt and texture; goat cheese or shredded mozzarella can substitute, but expect less tang and creaminess. Sun-dried tomatoes oil-packed make handling easier - if dry, soak briefly in warm water until soft then drain. Hummus acts as a moisture barrier to stop dough sogginess and adds subtle flavor - plain or flavored hummus works. Crescent dough is fragile; refrigerate until ready to use to avoid stickiness. Foil-lined pans make cleanup easier and prevent sticking. Olive oil quality influences aroma and overall flavor. Lemon juice fresh, not bottled, wakes up the herbs and chicken brightness. Use dried herbs for shelf-life but fresh oregano or thyme fine if you have them, chop finely."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating oil until it shimmers; this means it's hot enough for a proper sear, not smoking. Garlic added off-heat or too early browns quickly, becoming bitter instead of fragrant. Chicken should sizzle but not roar; medium heat prevents burning outside while chicken cooks internally. Internal temp monitoring is better than guesswork – 160F target with carryover to 165F when resting. Rolling crescents thin is risky; too thin tears and fillings leak, too thick makes dough chewy. Spread hummus very thin – too thick makes dough soggy during baking. Overcrowding pan drops oven heat and traps steam, no crispness. Look for browning edges, flaky texture before taking out. Let rest to prevent filling eruption and ease eating. Trust senses more than timers. Use light fingertip sealing, hot water dampness to bond edges. If dough splits or leaks, patch with extra dough pieces or pinch edges again before baking. Don’t skip oil spray; under greased pans stick like glue. If low on olives or sun-dried tomatoes, chopped roasted red peppers add sweetness and moisture. Egg wash optional for shiny crust. Avoid overfilling - messier, dough tears, longer bake needed."
tips:
- "Heat oil till shimmery, not smoking. Garlic frying too early burns it bitter; add just before chicken goes in or mid-sizzle. Chicken sizzle should be gentle - if it roars, dries out. Flip chicken mid-cook, pour lemon juice over middle of cooking for brightness. Internal temp 160F minimum. Carryover to 165F resting - no guesswork. Use thin fingertip wetness to seal, avoid thick dough edges or leaks."
- "Roll crescents carefully. Too thin tears; too thick means chewy, dull edges. Thin hummus spread stops soggy bottoms but avoid soaking dough. Thin veil, not puddle. Spread hummus first, then layer cheese, olives, tomatoes, chicken last to keep filling balanced. Overfilling breaks dough and leaks juice during baking. Use chicken pieces about tsp size - uniform. Roll tight but gentle; seal edges with just enough pressure."
- "Use oil spray liberally on foil-lined baking sheet; avoids sticking and soggy bottoms. Don’t overcrowd pan - crowding drops heat, traps steam, brakes crispness. Look and listen for crisp edges with golden brown spots. Tap rolls lightly to check hollow sound. Rest 2-3 minutes after baking to let filling settle; stops filling eruption on bite. Egg wash optional but adds shiny golden crust without altering flavors."
- "Substitutions keep it flexible. Boneless skinless thighs add fat, juicier but oily filling risk. Kalamata olives swap for green olives or capers for varied briny notes. Feta is key for salt and tang; goat cheese or shredded mozzarella less tangy, less creamy texture. Use sun-dried tomatoes oil-packed; if dry, soak briefly warm water, drain well to soften and avoid dryness. Crescent dough must be cold to handle easier. Refrigerate till rolling time."
- "Oven temps and times vary, trust smell and feel. Nutty butter aroma mixed with lemon zing signals doneness. Rolling thin crescents stressful but patience pays. Avoid tugging dough to keep shape. If dough splits or filling leaks mid-roll, patch with extra dough pieces or pinch edges firmly. Do not skip oil spray totally; sticky pan ruins whole batch. Garlic timing matters: add late for aroma, early burns."
faq:
- "q: How to prevent soggy bottoms? a: Spray foil-lined pan well. Don’t crowd rolls. Thin hummus as barrier stops sogginess. Oven heat must stay steady. Let rolls rest off hot pan after baking. Parchment paper traps moisture, avoid it here."
- "q: Can I use chicken thighs instead of tenderloins? a: Yes but watch fat. Thighs take longer to cook; risk oil leaking into filling. Adjust time, maybe lower heat to avoid burning outside. Juicier, but filling wetter, dough fragile. Drain excess oil after cooking to reduce sogginess."
- "q: What if dough tears while rolling? a: Patch with dough scraps or pinch sealed edges stronger. Roll gently, avoid pulling. Let dough rest in fridge if too sticky or warming. Use flour on surface to prevent sticking, but don’t overdo—dough gets tough."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container 2-3 days. Reheat in oven or toaster oven for crispness, microwave makes dough soggy. Freeze tightly wrapped rolls, thaw overnight in fridge, re-bake briefly. Avoid long storage to keep flaky texture."
