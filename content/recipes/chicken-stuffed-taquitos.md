ingredients:
- "=== Guacamole ==="
- "1 medium ripe avocado peeled pitted"
- "1 lime juice fresh squeezed"
- "1 small green onion chopped"
- "1/3 jalapeño seeded diced"
- "salt pepper to taste"
- "=== Taquitos ==="
- "320 g cooked shredded chicken thighs"
- "90 g shredded Monterey Jack cheese"
- "2 green onions finely sliced"
- "10 small flour tortillas 15 cm diameter"
- "25 ml canola oil"
- "=== Optional sides ==="
- "shredded iceberg lettuce"
- "salsa jarred or homemade"
- "sour cream"
instructions:
- "=== Guacamole ==="
- "Smash avocado in bowl with fork until chunky mashed. Add lime juice immediately; keeps color fresh. Stir in green onion and jalapeño. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Rest while prepping taquitos to let flavors meld."
- "=== Taquitos ==="
- "In separate bowl combine shredded chicken, cheese, green onions. Salt and pepper. Mix vigorously — use fingers or wooden spoon. The key is blending until mixture holds together, a bit sticky, so filling won’t escape when cooking."
- "Lay tortillas flat on clean surface, few at once so they don’t dry out. Spoon about 50 ml chicken mixture (slightly more than 3 tbsp) at bottom third of each tortilla. Roll tightly, pressing gently. If filling pokes out, push it back inside with fingers."
- "Secure rolls with toothpicks or thread a thin wooden skewer through 4–5 in a row. This holds shape and helps flip evenly."
- "Heat canola oil over medium heat in large nonstick skillet. Sizzle should be steady, not smoky. Place half the taquitos seam side down. Cook 3–4 minutes until undersides turn a deep golden brown and firm. Flip carefully; you’ll hear crisp crunch coming."
- "Remove toothpicks/skewers once bottom is set and flip onto other sides — each side takes about 2 minutes. Watch for even browning, dark amber spots forming. Press lightly with spatula as needed to crisp up evenly."
- "Drain completed batch on paper towels while you cook remaining taquitos, adding oil between batches if pan looks dry or tortillas seem to stick."
- "Serve plates lined with shredded iceberg lettuce if using. Pile taquitos on top. Spoon guacamole alongside, add salsa and dollop sour cream to cool the palate."
- "=== Tips ==="
- "If chicken is dry, toss with a little lime juice or chicken broth before mixing with cheese. Use Monterey Jack or a mild cheddar replacement if Tex-Mex blend unavailable. Corn tortillas can break when rolled, so keep them warm and pliable if swapping flour for authentic feel. Overfilling causes bursting during frying - resist temptation to heap filling."
- "Use moderate heat and listen — the taquitos crackle and pop when ready. Too hot means burned edges before inside cooks through. Not enough oil and tortillas stick or cook unevenly. Practice patience. Removing skewers early prevents tearing as you crisp other sides."
- "Guacamole can be spiced up by keeping jalapeño seeds or adding a dash of smoked paprika — your call on heat and flavor layers."
- "For a quick shortcut, bake at 200°C (400°F) for 15 minutes flipping halfway if less oil preferred. Results differ slightly in texture but less mess."
- "Keep tortillas covered with damp towel as you work to keep them supple. If mixture feels loose, refrigerate filling briefly or add extra cheese to bind better."
introduction: "Never trust soft tacos alone when craving crunch. Taquitos offer that snap, the toasty scent of frying tortillas, chicken mingling with melting cheese in every bite. I’ve hopped between recipes and found the trick: the filling must stick, not spill under sear. Learned to dot toothpicks like markers to keep rolls intact and avoid the messy splitting fiasco I had once. The guacamole? Keep it chunky and bright — the lime juice arrests browning; the jalapeño gives just the right tease on the tongue. The combo breaks the monotony if you serve with plain lettuce and sour cream. Plays well with quick weeknight dinners when energy’s low but appetite isn’t. No fancy tools, just a pan and some patience. The real magic? Hearing that crackle as tortillas toast to a golden brown, smelling that faint corn-silk aroma mingled with sizzling chicken."
ingredientsNote: "Opt for chicken thighs if available; they stay juicy and shred easily. If only breasts, brine briefly or add a splash of broth to keep moisture. Monterey Jack melts better than most cheeses but mild cheddar works fine in a pinch. You can swap canola for avocado oil which adds a subtle fruitiness and stands heat well. Tortillas should be soft and fresh but not too thin or they tear; warming them wrapped in a damp towel before rolling prevents cracking. For guacamole, always add lime juice last to avoid browning sooner. Jalapeño seeds carry much heat—remove if fear of spice but I prefer some kick to wake the palate. Skip the lettuce and replace sour cream with Greek yogurt to lighten or add a smoky chipotle salsa if you want heat without dairy."
instructionsNote: "The filling stage is crucial — if it doesn’t stick, it’ll spill messily while frying and make the rolling frustrating. Mix vigorously; use your fingers to test adhesion. Roll tortillas while warm but not hot or they’ll break. Toothpicks are lifesavers for keeping shape but remove midway during cooking to ensure even crunching edges, then finish frying without them. Medium heat ensures tortillas cook through without burning or grease overheating and absorbing too much oil. Watch closely for color — golden spots deepen, tortillas blister slightly, you hear that telltale crackle. Odd smell or uneven coloring means adjustment needed. Cook in batches so pan temp holds steady. Drain on absorbent paper or mesh if you want less greasiness; dab gently not to tear. Serve immediately for crunch."
tips:
- "Mix filling vigorously with fingers, test stickiness; filling must hold or it spills while frying. Use shredded chicken thighs over breasts if possible for juiciness. If filling feels loose, chill briefly or add more cheese. Warm tortillas wrapped in damp towel before rolling to prevent cracks and tearing. Toothpicks secure rolls but remove midway during cooking to avoid burning or uneven crisping."
- "Heat should be moderate—listen for crackling not fierce popping. Too hot burns edges before inside cooks; too low oil causes sticking or soggy spots. Cook in batches to keep oil temp steady. Press gently with spatula to even browning. Watch for amber spots, blistering edges, and faint corn-silk aroma as signs of doneness. Don’t overcrowd pan or rolls won’t brown right."
- "Layer flavors by adding lime juice last in guacamole to stop browning. Jalapeño seeds add heat; remove some if you want milder but keep seeds for that tongue tease. If you want smoky heat, swap in chipotle salsa or smoked paprika but add cautiously. Sour cream cools spice but Greek yogurt swaps nicely for lighter contrast. Serve with shredded iceberg lettuce for crunch counterpoint but optional."
- "Roll tortillas tightly but without forcing filling out. If you see spikes of chicken poke through, push back inside with fingers; otherwise filling leaks. Use toothpicks or wooden skewers threaded through 4–5 rolls to keep shape and help flipping but beware of burning ends. Remove them halfway through cooking one side for evenly crisped edges. Drain fried taquitos on paper towels to shed excess oil but don’t press hard or tear skin."
- "For shortcut bake option, use 200°C oven for 15 minutes flipping halfway if avoiding frying. Texture varies—less crisp, less mess. If filling dries during prep, toss with splash of lime juice or chicken broth before mixing cheese. Monterey Jack melts best but mild cheddar works if no alternative. Canola oil preferred but avocado oil adds subtle fruitiness and tolerates heat well. Keep filling and tortillas temperature balanced for best roll and fry results."
faq:
- "q: How to keep filling from spilling? a: Mix firmly, test with fingers. If loose, chill or add cheese. Roll tight but don’t force. Watch for cracks in tortilla. Use toothpicks to hold shape. Remove them cautiously during cooking."
- "q: Can I use corn tortillas instead of flour? a: Yes but corn can crack easy. Warm well wrapped in damp towel. Handle gently. They won’t roll as smoothly; fill less to prevent breakage. Flour holds better but corn gives authentic flavor. Pan temp and oil amount need adjusting."
- "q: Why do taquitos stick to the pan? a: Oil temp too low or pan not nonstick enough. Make sure oil is shimmering but not smoking. Add oil between batches if needed. Dry tortillas stick more. Cook with moderate heat, move rolls carefully. Paper towel drain after frying helps avoid sogginess."
- "q: How to store leftovers properly? a: Cool completely before storing loose in airtight container. Can refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat in oven or toaster oven to keep crisp, avoid microwave sogginess. Freeze before cooking if prepping ahead; thaw before frying. Avoid stacking when hot or skin softens."
