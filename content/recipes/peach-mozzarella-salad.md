instructions:
- "Whisk olive oil, lime juice, harissa paste, and a drizzle of honey in a small bowl. Set aside the dressing."
- "Arrange peaches, nectarines, and apricots in alternating layers on a large platter mixing colors and shapes."

- "Finish with a few pinches of coarse sea salt and a crack of black pepper."
introduction: "Juicy peaches, ripe nectarines, soft apricots meet creamy mozzarella and burrata—creamier, more supple than plain mozzarella alone. Harissa heat swaps out the sambal spice for a North African fire, tempered by honey’s subtle sweetness. Prosciutto stands in for the salty, rustic saucisson, lending a thinner, silkier texture and a different cured flavor. Fresh herbs mingle differently too: basil classic, mint added for brightness and coolness. Scallions cut with subtle onion sharpness. Lime juice replaces lemon, adding a softer citrus tang. A salad built with layers, colors, texture contrasts. Simple but striking. A summer starter that’s almost like summer on a plate. Quick to put together. No cooking. All freshness."
ingredientsNote: "Use very ripe stone fruit, just shy of soft to hold shape but sweet. Burrata provides creaminess and a touch more richness than mozzarella—if unavailable, more mozzarella is fine. Prosciutto should be paper thin, torn gently, not chopped to preserve delicate texture. Harissa replaces sambal oelek to change profile from Southeast Asian to Mediterranean without losing spice—the amount measured is mild, adjust if you want more fire. Lime juice is less sharp than lemon, better with honey to balance sweet and tart. Fresh mint offers lift, replace with tarragon or chervil if unavailable. Sea salt should be flaky for bursts of flavor. Use high-quality extra virgin olive oil for best sheen and depth."
instructionsNote: "Prepare dressing first: whisk ingredients thoroughly. Let rest briefly for flavors to meld. Arrange fruit and cheese alternately, keep presentation loose not rigid. Tear cheese by hand for rustic effect. Scatter herbs and scallions unevenly—random, not uniform. Add cured meat last to keep its shape visible. Dress salad right before serving, not earlier to avoid sogginess. Finish with salt and pepper at table if possible for texture and aroma freshness. Can be served on chilled platter or individual plates. Leftovers best within hours; burrata and fruit won’t keep texture beyond a day. No cooking required, just sharp knives and fresh hands."
tips:
- "Dressing first always. Whisk olive oil, lime juice, harissa, honey till combined. Let rest a bit for flavors to mingle but not too long or lime gets bitter. Honey balances heat, so measure carefully. Too much harissa kills sweetness. Keep mild unless you want extra punch."
- "Fruit selection matters. Pick stone fruits ripe but still firm to avoid mush when sliced. Quarter peaches or nectarines then slice apricots just before plating to keep shapes distinct. Color contrasts key. Soft apricots provide a different texture layer versus firmer peaches. Hold shape well to prevent mess."
- "Cheese prep. Tear burrata and mozzarella by hand. No knives here to keep rustic chunks. Burrata adds creaminess, moisture, stick carefully so it doesn’t break apart too much. Mozzarella clusters spaced randomly to keep bite bursts. More mozzarella doable if no burrata on hand, but texture shifts noticeably."
- "Herbs and scallions jaggedly torn and scattered. Basil and mint add distinct notes, mint freshness cuts richness. Mint julienned fine; basil leaves torn bigger. Scallions thinly sliced for sharp onion aroma, uneven scatter keeps visual interest and layers of flavor."
- "Prosciutto use paper-thin, torn gently; no chopping. Thin ribbons ease layering, give salty silkiness. Add last before dressing to keep texture intact. Press too hard or cut too small, you lose delicate mouthfeel and appearance. Tear with fingers for best visual and textural result."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Yes, stone fruits vary seasonally. Try plums, cherries, or figs. Texture changes. Adjust slicing to keep neat. Firmer fruits better shape. Flavor shifts but the basic combo works."
- "q: What if no burrata? a: More mozzarella fine but less creamy. Burrata adds softness and richness that affects mouthfeel. Substitute with soft ricotta or fresh goat cheese if available. Texture less silky but still good."
- "q: Dressing too spicy? a: Dilute with more olive oil or honey. Harissa varies in intensity. Add slowly, taste after each addition. Lime juice mellowing, honey sweetness balances. Sometimes use less at start, add more later if needed."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Salad best eaten immediately; burrata and fruit get soggy fast. Cover tightly, refrigerate if needed but separate dressing so fruits don’t get wet. Eat within hours, not overnight. No reheating, just chill."
