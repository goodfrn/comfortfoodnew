- "45 ml red wine vinegar"
- "1 small shallot, finely minced"
- "Pinch of cayenne pepper"

instructions:
- "Position oven rack center. Preheat to 190 °C (375 °F). Line baking sheet with parchment."
- "Arrange bacon pieces spread out. Roast 15 minutes, crisped and browned. Remove, reserve."
- "Meanwhile, toss shrimp with smoked paprika, 30 ml olive oil, salt, pepper."
- "Heat grill pan or skillet on medium-high. Grill shrimp 2 to 3 minutes per side until opaque. Remove."

- "Add hot shrimp and crushed bacon bits. Stir gently. Serve immediately."
introduction: "White beans cold and soft. Shrimp hot, smoky and tender. Bacon gives crunch, smoky saltiness. Thyme and parsley, different but fresh. Shallots in vinegar for zing. No cream, no nuts, no gluten. Just pure textures and flavors clashing and blending. 30 minutes total, easy. Grilled shrimp sizzle. Bacon crackles. Beans soak up all the juices. Serve right away. Salad but feels like a meal. Simple, rustic, sharp. A quick smoky summer dish. Layers that make you want to chew. Light but filling. Not boring. Coastal inspiration. Grill, roast, toss. Eat in sun or shade. Repeat."
ingredientsNote: "Smoked bacon swaps pancetta but still delivers crispiness and richness. Shrimp peeled completely, tails removed for ease eating. Smoked paprika adds depth instead of sweet. Fresh thyme and parsley replace basil and chives, contributes earthiness and brightness. Shallots give mild allium punch in place of garlic. Cherry tomatoes stay but halved for bursts of color and juice. Red wine vinegar is vibrant, balances the richness. Olive oil divided between shrimp marinade and salad dressing. Beans from cans, drained and rinsed well to remove excess salt and cans flavor. Fresh herbs should be sizable afresh for best aroma. Mix carefully so beans do not break. No nuts, dairy, or gluten. Suitable for many diets."
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven a bit lower for bacon so it crisps slowly, less chance of burning. Line baking tray to catch drippings and ease cleanup. Roast bacon for a few more minutes than original to accommodate thickness. Toss shrimp with most but not all oil and spices to coat evenly. Using grill pan creates grill marks and slightly smoky char instead of baking or pan fry. Cook shrimp quickly, 2-3 minutes each side, until just opaque to avoid toughness. In large bowl, mix beans first with herbs, vinegar, shallots, spices to allow flavors to meld while shrimp cooks. Add shrimp and bacon hot to carry flavors into beans gently. Serve quickly so bacon stays crisp and shrimp warm. Season final salad last, bin tasting to adjust salt or heat. Use gentle folding motions. The mix of warm shrimp and cold beans creates nice temperature contrast. No standing or chilling, eat that moment for best texture."
tips:
- "Bacon can burn fast. Best to watch closely. Roast at a lower temp first next time. No rush here, let it crisp slow. Catch drippings on parchment. Easier cleanup too."
- "Grilling shrimp on high heat quickens cooking. 2-3 minutes per side. Remove as soon as opaque, not tough. Marinade shrimp first with spices. Keep some oil for later."
- "Mix white beans with other salad ingredients before shrimp finishes cooking. Blend thyme, parsley, vinegar, shallots well. Allow flavors to mesh together. Toss gently."
- "Serve immediately for best texture contrast. Warm shrimp plus cool beans work well. Bacon adds crunch. Shrimp must be hot. Cold beans should be crisp."
- "Adjust seasoning after mixing salad. Taste often to find balance. Salt, pepper, spice levels can shift. Ingredients bring their own flavor too. Trust your palate."
faq:
- "q: How to store leftovers a: Store in fridge. Use airtight container. Consume within two days. Cold is fine. But shrimp taste can fade."
- "q: Can I use different beans a: Yes, other beans exist. Use what you prefer, like cannelini. Avoid too many flavors though. Balance is key."
- "q: Can I prep ahead a bit a: Sure, prep components separately. Grill shrimp same day. Bacon can store longer. Salad mix last minute."
- "q: Any other proteins work well a: Chicken, fish are options. But cook differently. Adjust cooking time based on size. Firm is preferred."
