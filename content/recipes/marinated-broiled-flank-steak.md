description: "Thin flank steak soaked in red wine, oil, lemon, and shallots. Broiled to medium or medium-rare, rested before slicing against the grain. Fingerling potatoes roasted at 400F until tender. Optional rich red wine and beef broth reduction with honey for drizzle. Prep involves marinating at least 5 hours; broiling 5-7 minutes each side, rest 10 minutes. Visual doneness found by color change and firm but springy texture. Aromas of herbs and caramelizing shallots signal progress. Practical swaps include balsamic vinegar for lemon, or chicken broth if beef unavailable. Serves 4 with fingerling potatoes and greens, balancing smoky meat with crisp tubers and velvety sauce."

ingredients:
- "1 1/2 pounds flank steak"
- "1 cup dry red wine"
- "1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil"
- "3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice"
- "2 large shallots roughly chopped"
- "1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves"
- "1 tablespoon fresh rosemary finely chopped"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 teaspoon ground black pepper"
- "1 pound fingerling potatoes halved"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "Salt and pepper"
- "For sauce optional"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 large shallot minced"
- "1/2 cup dry red wine"
- "1/2 cup beef broth or good quality chicken broth"
- "1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup"
instructions:
- "=== Marinate Flank Steak ==="
- "Throw flank steak in gallon bag; dump red wine, olive oil, lemon juice, chopped shallots, thyme, rosemary, salt, pepper. Give a gentle squeeze to combine ingredients. Marinade must live in fridge 5 to 6 hours minimum; overnight’s best if you’ve got time. Thin cut takes flavors fast but needs that acid and oil to soften fibers. Don’t rush or end up chewing rubber."
- "=== Prepare Fingerling Potatoes ==="
- "While steak’s soaking, wash potatoes, cut in half. Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper till slick but not drowning. Spread skin-side down on rimmed baking sheet. Oven at 400°F; bake 18 to 25 minutes depending on size, fork tender and crisped edges signal readiness. If impatient, poke with fork after 15 to check softness — skin should crackle, flesh tender but not mushy."
- "=== Broil Flank Steak ==="
- "Pull steak from fridge 15 minutes before broiling. Lay on foil-lined baking sheet; let excess marinade drip off—too much liquid causes steaming, no bueno. Broil on top rack for 5 to 7 minutes per side, depending on thickness and how rare you like it. Look for deep browning with faint charring, edges curling slightly. Insert meat thermometer near center: 130°F for medium rare, 155°F for medium. Resist stabbing too early or juices will escape."
- "=== Rest and Slice ==="
- "Wrap steak loosely in foil and let rest 8 to 10 minutes. Critical step: redistributes juices, avoids dry edges. When slicing, find grain direction and cut sharply against it; short fibers mean tender bites. Slice about 1/4 inch thick. Serve immediately with potatoes."
- "=== Red Wine Reduction ==="
- "Heat olive oil in saucepan over medium heat; add finely minced shallot, sweat till translucent and fragrant — 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in 1/2 cup red wine and beef broth, bring to boil, then simmer briskly until reduced about 6 to 12 minutes. Should coat spoon lightly. Strain to remove shallots, season with salt and drizzle honey or maple syrup to balance acidity. Pour warm over sliced steak for extra punch."
- "=== Tips and Substitutions ==="
- "Lemon juice can be swapped for balsamic vinegar for a sweeter tang. No beef broth? Use good chicken broth or mushroom broth for earthiness. If wine is scarce, try grape juice with a splash of vinegar. Dry steak with paper towels before broiling to avoid steaming. Use tongs, not fork, to flip steak to preserve juices. Don’t skip rest; impatient cooks always regret it. Fingerling potatoes can be replaced with baby Yukon gold or red potatoes, adjusting roasting time slightly. Try shaking potatoes with garlic powder or smoked paprika for extra kick."
introduction: "Flank steak, a lean, thin muscle, loves a good soak; marinating isn’t optional if you want tenderness over toughness. The acid and oil break down fibers and inject flavor deep inside. Time is your friend here — let it sit minimum 5 hours, overnight if forgotten. Broiling hits the crust quickly, locking juices inside. Watch the color change from pinkish red to a rich brown and feel the firmness with your finger. Fingerling potatoes roasting alongside add a golden, salty counterpoint—crisp skin, soft inside. The aroma of fresh herbs and balsamic-like sharpness of shallots cooking builds anticipation. Red wine reduction brings everything home with slight sweetness and silky texture. These techniques have saved many flank steak nights gone wrong before, no more leathery mouthfuls."
ingredientsNote: "The marinade balances acidity and fat; lemon juice or vinegar tenderize, while olive oil carries flavors and prevents drying. Shallots add bite and aroma; herbs like rosemary and thyme bring earthy brightness. Salt is crucial - not just for seasoning but also for drawing out moisture and flavor penetration. For potatoes, use fingerlings or small baby varieties that roast evenly. Olive oil plus salt makes skin crisp and flavorful. If you lack beef broth, chicken or mushroom broth works fine for sauce. Dry wine adds acidity, sweetness, and complexity, but grape juice with vinegar or apple cider vinegar can fill in pinch situations. Honey or maple syrup offsets acidity in reduction. Always rinse potatoes to remove dirt; slice for even cooking."
instructionsNote: "Marinating for at least 5 hours is key; ignoring this invites tough steak. Combine marinade ingredients gently—overmixing bruises herbs and muddles shallots. Remove excess liquid before broiling to avoid steaming the meat. Broil on high rack; fat will start sizzling and edges crust. Flip steak only once, using tongs to keep juice inside. Use visual cues over strict timing — each oven varies and meat varies in thickness. Rest steak wrapped loosely in foil to let juices redistribute — impatient cooks lose moisture here. Slice against grain, about 1/4 inch thick, or chew suffers. Roast potatoes in a single layer for even crisping; flip once if needed. Sauce thickens and darkens as liquid evaporates; don’t burn. Adjust seasoning last."
tips:
- "Marinate flank steak minimum five hours fridge cold—acid breaks tough fibers but not too long or meat turns mushy. Use gentle squeezes mixing marinade, no rough smashing. Remove excess liquid before broil to avoid steaming. Pat steak dry with paper towels, crust forms better that way. Wait 15 mins room temp before broil, so heat penetrates evenly inside."
- "Potatoes—fingerlings best small, roast single layer skin side down. Olive oil spread thin, salt right before bake. Oven hot, 400 degrees high rack or rimmed sheet ensures crisp skin. Check fork after 15 mins poke, want tender flesh but firm hold shape. Flip once if edges brown unevenly. Toss spices last moment if using garlic powder or smoked paprika, or they burn fast."
- "Broil flank steak top rack, around 5-7 minutes per side depending thickness. Watch edges curl, smell herbs and caramelizing shallots. Use meat thermometer inserted sideways—130 degrees for medium rare, 155 for medium don’t pierce often or juice loss. Look for deep browning with faint char, crust seals flavors inside."
- "Rest steak loosely wrapped in foil 8 to 10 mins crucial—juices redistribute keep edges moist. Slice sharply against grain grain direction found by lines on meat. Cut about quarter inch thick, thinner bites make chew easier. Serve immediately with potatoes to avoid drying. Don’t stack slices, air flows keep texture intact."
- "Red wine reduction—start olive oil low heat add minced shallots sweat translucent, smell is key. Simmer wine and broth briskly reduce until coats spoon lightly but not too thick. Strain solids. Season last with salt and drizzle honey or maple syrup to soften acidity. Warm pour over steak; sauce cools fast, reheat gently if needed. Alternate broths change flavor profile nicely."
faq:
- "q: How long to marinate flank steak? a: Five hours minimum fridge cold. Acid breaks fibers but don’t overdo it—too long makes mushy. Overnight is solid. Room temp before cooking helps even heat."
- "q: Can I substitute red wine in marinade? a: Yes, grape juice plus splash vinegar works if no wine. Balsamic vinegar can replace lemon juice if preferred. Chicken or mushroom broth for sauce if beef broth missing."
- "q: What if steak steams instead of browns? a: Dry meat with paper towels, remove excess liquid marinade. Broil on high rack, fat sizzles and edges crisp. Flip once with tongs, no fork piercing or juices leak."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap steak tightly foil or airtight container fridge, keeps 3 to 4 days. Potatoes best reheated in oven to restore crispness, sauce reheat gently stove top or microwave short bursts."
