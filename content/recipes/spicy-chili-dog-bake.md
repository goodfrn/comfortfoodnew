ingredients:
- "=== Chili ==="
- "475 g ground beef"
- "30 ml vegetable oil"
- "1 large onion chopped"
- "1 large garlic clove minced"
- "25 ml chili seasoning mix"
- "5 ml ground cumin"
- "1 can 400 ml diced tomatoes"
- "1 can 400 ml red kidney beans rinsed drained"
- "250 ml chicken broth"
- "150 g frozen corn kernels thawed"
- "=== Cheese Sauce ==="
- "320 g extra sharp orange cheddar shredded"
- "15 ml cornstarch"
- "5 ml chili seasoning"
- "1 can 350 ml evaporated milk"
- "15 ml sambal oelek"
- "=== Hot Dogs ==="
- "12 merguez sausages pre-cooked"
- "2 large soft baguettes"
- "3 scallions sliced"
instructions:
- "=== Chili ==="
- "Heat oil medium-high in heavy pot. Toss in ground beef. Immediately start breaking up meat with wooden spoon. Hear that sizzle? That’s fat rendering, shows beef is dry enough to brown, not steam. When meat starts browning unevenly, drop onion and garlic in. Stir. Wait until onion edges turn translucent then golden curled. If you smell bitter, onions overheated. Lower heat then. Salt and pepper here. Watch as mixture thickens, juices evaporate, smells deepen."
- "Sprinkle in chili mix and cumin now—toast the spices gently to bloom oils. Pour in tomatoes, beans, broth; stir. Bring to simmer not boil—tiny bubbles across surface, not rolling. After 5 min, add corn, stir to combine. Let simmer another 18 minutes uncovered. Sauce will darken, thicken, bubble sounds will slow. Skim any excess fat if floating. Reserve warm."
- "=== Cheese Sauce ==="
- "Off heat, toss cheese with cornstarch and chili powder in saucepan. Blend well before pouring in evaporated milk steadily while whisking to avoid lumps. Add sambal oelek for heat—don’t skip, ties flavors. Warm over medium while whisking continuously, scrape bottom and sides often to prevent scorching. Can hear gentle simmer when ready, approximately 9–12 minutes. Thickness should coat spoon, sauce clings, silky but not stiff. Remove from stove promptly to avoid curdling."
- "=== Build ==="
- "Slice baguettes lengthwise without cutting through. Warm bread briefly on grill or oven until soft but sturdy."
- "Spread quarter of cheese sauce inside each baguette base. Overlap cooked merguez sausages snugly, juicy bursts expected while eating. Spoon chili over sausages, cover with remaining cheese sauce. Sprinkle scallions on top for crunch and freshness."
- "Press gently to seal, then slice into manageable chunks for sharing. Serve immediately or wrap and reheat at low temp."
- "Leftover chili freezes well for next round; freeze cheese sauce separately to maintain smoothness. Merguez can be swapped for spicy Italian sausages or bratwurst depending on mood; mild? Use smoked paprika instead of chili powder."
- "Tips: Use skillet with thick base to avoid hot spots. Don’t rush browning onions—they build depth. Over-thick cheese sauce can be loosened with splash milk, reheat slow to avoid separation. When cutting baguettes, use serrated knife and saw gently for neat edges."
introduction: "So I've been messing with chili-and-cheese dogs for years. The combo's messy but satisfying. Use merguez for that kick or switch up sausages, whatever. Must get the beef browning right—don't steam it or it turns mushy and pale. That sizzle sound? Golden signal. Then the onions. Wait for edges to caramelize, slight crunch inside. Garlic drops in after. Spices toasted separately can taste flat, so add them to hot fat with meat and veggies. Chili thickens with time. Corn adds pop, beans heft. Cheese sauce? Not just melted cheese but a proper roux-like thickener with cornstarch in here, no lumps, plus sambal oelek, that little bite. The bread should be pliable; too fresh and it tears—let it rest a day or warm gently. Slice into chunks for hands-on fun. Perfect for a crowd or lazy weekend grub. Remember, smells and textures tell you more than clocks."
ingredientsNote: "Ground beef quantity bumped slightly to 475g for richer chili. Oil stays at two tablespoons but vegetable or light olive oil works well—don’t use heavy oils, they mask flavor. Onion size increased for more sweetness; the garlic clove made a little bigger, easier to mince finely. Swapped precise chili seasoning brand for mix of chili powder, smoked paprika, and cayenne—makes it personal. Beans from 398 ml can adjusted to 400 ml just for ease, same with tomatoes. Frozen corn works but fresh adds crunch and brightness if available. For cheese, extra sharp cheddar punches flavor up—mild cheddar dulls sauce. Cornstarch amount exacted for reliable thickening. Sambal oelek essential for heat layer; swap with sriracha if you lack it but expect different flavor. Baguettes need soft crust; old crusty ones tear and don’t fold. Scallions add mild freshness, swap with thin-sliced red onion if preferred. Merguez sausages awarded star here for spicy perfume; substitute with chorizo or Italian sausage for varied results."
instructionsNote: "Step one always means browning beef first, breaking it apart asap to avoid clumps and steaming. Watch and listen for sizzling fat, clear sign of drying meat surface. Adding onions after initial beef color achieved prevents sogginess. Garlic after onions soften. Salt pepper from start but always adjust later; spices weigh heavily. Let the pot bubble softly—too much heat yields over-reduction or burnt bottom. Stir occasionally—not constantly—to allow chili to thicken. Use wooden spoon for better tactile feedback. Cheese sauce demands patience; whisk thoroughly while heating slowly so cornstarch disperses and cheese melts evenly; stop when sauce thickly coats spoon but isn’t rubbery. Do not let sauce boil aggressively to avoid graininess. Bread warming does more than soften; sets shape for filling so it doesn’t leak chili. Assemble hot dogs in that order for structure—cheese base seals bread, sausages next, chili layers in, cheese topping melts atop and holds everything together. Finish with fresh scallions for balance. Cut with serrated knife using a gentle sawing motion to prevent squashing bun. This assembly holds better if served promptly, but can be kept warm under tented foil. Best eaten messy with hands. This method learned after frustrating failed attempts with soggy buns and broken hotdogs."
tips:
- "Brown beef first dry and hot. Wait for sizzle then toss onions in edges turning translucent but with curls not soggy. Garlic only after onions soften. Layer spices onto fat not raw. Toast spice oils in warmed fat, not burnt. Timing here key for flavor depth."
- "Cheese sauce needs patience. Blend dry cheddar with cornstarch before milk. Pour milk slow while whisking to dodge lumps. Medium heat only, scrape sides bottom often. Listen for soft simmer, 9 to 12 mins. Watch color and texture closely. Stops thick but flows."
- "Bag crust must bend without cracking. Too fresh tears. Rest it a day or warm gently before slicing. Serrated knife, slow saw. Don’t press or mash bread, keep fluffy integrity to hold sauce and chili. Bread softness balances chili moisture."
- "Only add corn near end to keep bite. Beans rinsed and drained to control salt and bulk. Chili simmers low with occasional stirs. Watch bubbles, not furious boil. Skim excess fats if floating for cleaner finish. Heat control crucial, avoid drying out chili too fast."
- "Sausage choice changes profile. Merguez spicy, aromatic. Swap with Italian or bratwurst for milder or smoky touch. Sambal oelek key in sauce, swaps sriracha but expect shift in heat and flavor. Fresh scallions top for crunch, can sub thin red onion but different. Assemble hot dogs immediately for best hold."
faq:
- "q: How do I know when the chili is done? a: Look for thickening with slower bubble sounds. Darkening color, aroma deepens. Corn and beans added later keep freshness. Skim fat if visible floating. Should coat spoon not run watery."
- "q: Can I use different sausages? a: Yes. Merguez brings spice, swap bratwurst or Italian for flavor shift. Adjust chili heat if milder sausage used. Sausage precooked recommended; ensures juicy bites without extra cooking time."
- "q: What if cheese sauce lumps? a: Blend cornstarch and cheese before milk. Whisk constantly adding milk slowly on medium heat. Scrape pan often. Stop heating once sauce coats spoon but semi-fluid. Too hot or rushing causes graininess or separation."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Chili freezes well; cheese sauce better separate then thaw gently, whisk to reblend. Sausages should be kept cold. Bread stores separately, rewarm before assembly to avoid soggy buns. Wrap chili tight to retain moisture, avoid freezer burn."
