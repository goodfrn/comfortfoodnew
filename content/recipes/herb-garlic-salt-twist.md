ingredients:
- "20 g (3 tbsp) chive flowers trimmed and chopped"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) parsley, stems and leaves"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) fresh lemon balm, leaves and stems"
- "120 g (1/2 cup) salt"
- "10 g (1/4 cup) fresh basil leaves"
instructions:
- "1. Rough chop chive flowers, parsley, lemon balm, basil. Place in food processor bowl."
- "2. Pulse 3-4 times to break down herbs and flowers. Scrape sides with spatula. Avoid pureeing."
- "3. Add salt. Stir with spatula until uniformly mixed. Some coarse bits okay."
- "4. Transfer to airtight jar. Seal tightly, refrigerate."
- "5. Wait 1-2 days to develop flavors before use. Keeps up to 2 weeks refrigerated."
- "6. Sprinkle on fresh salads, roasted vegetables, grilled fish or chicken. Mix into vinaigrettes and marinades."
introduction: "Garlic flowers swapped out. Chive blossoms take their place. Basil replaces coriander. Bright, herbaceous, zesty. Salt cut back a notch. Fresh lemon balm rounds flavor. Fast, 15 minutes prep. Whiz, stir, jar. Herb salt changes. Flowers and herbs chopped to bits but not powder. Toss on everything. Tomatoes, cucumbers, fish hot off grill. Dressings twisted up. Storage short. Fridge sealed keeps zing alive 1 to 2 weeks. No fuss, no long waits. Simple seasoning upgrade. Magic in little jar. Punch meets fresh."
ingredientsNote: "Chive flowers give subtle oniony notes, less sharp than garlic flowers. Basil adds warmth and sweetness, swapping coriander’s citrusy zing for mellow depth. Lemon balm brightens herb mix, with fresh minty aroma. Salt reduced by 20 grams to avoid overpowering delicate herbs. Use fine sea salt for quick absorption but coarse can work if crushed well. Amounts flexible, balance to taste but keep flowers dominant for unique flavor. Freshness critical. Wilted herbs flatten taste fast. Trim tough stems to avoid bitterness. Drying herbs first loses punch. Use fresh or lightly dried. Store in airtight glass to hold aromas. Avoid plastic."
instructionsNote: "Avoid overprocessing or blending to paste. Pulse in food processor only a few times to maintain texture. Scrape continuously to prevent uneven grind. Mix salt in last to avoid clumping, ensuring even distribution throughout herb mix. Rough chop before processing, larger chunks help prevent pasty consistency. Use spatula to fold mixture gently rather than beating. Let rest sealed in fridge at least 24 hours to meld flavors before use. Fridge storage slows herbs decay, but consume within two weeks for best freshness. Toss on cold dishes or mix into warm sauces at end of cooking to preserve herbal brightness. Not for prolonged cooking times."
tips:
- "Pulse herbs gently only 3 or 4 times. Avoid pureeing to keep texture. Rough chop first, don’t skimp on trimming tough stems or leaves. Keep chunks noticeable, that stops pasty mess. Scrape sides often. Folding with spatula beats mixing or shaking—less break down. Salt added at end, stirred not processed. Coarse bits add bite. Freshness key. Wilted herbs lose zip fast. No drying unless very light. Cool fridge slows decay but use quick. Jar airtight. Plastic no good, aroma leaks out. Keep flowers dominant for distinct oniony sweet flash."
- "Herbs vary in moisture, adjust salt quantity if watery herbs used. Basil swaps coriander, so warmer, less zingy flavor. Lemon balm brightens but can get bitter with stems. Trim those tough bits carefully. Use fine sea salt for faster marrying of flavor, but crushed coarse works if mixed thoroughly. Keep color bright, avoid over chopping. Wait 1-2 days after storing to mellow salt and herb mix. Shake jar before use if salt settles unevenly. Experiment with quantities but keep flowers front and center – flavor backbone."
- "Store sealed glass jar only, no plastic or open containers. Chill slows herb wilting but not indefinite. Use within 2 weeks max. Better sooner. The flavor fades to dull quickly after. Avoid warm places or sunlight. Use on cold dishes or add late to avoid cooking herbs out. No simmering or baking with this mix. Best sprinkled on grilled fish, roasted veggies, salads. Fold into dressings last minute. Mix gently, keep coarse texture intact for punch and aroma. Quick prep does not mean carelessness. Fresh herbs fragile, handle soft not rough."
- "Chive flowers bring subtle onion notes, lighter than garlic flowers they replace here. Basil gives sweetness and herby warmth, less sharp than coriander’s zing. Lemon balm adds fresh minty lift but stems bite if too many. Herbs quantity less salt, to keep balance but not overwhelm delicate flavors. Use flexible but keep salt near half cup range—less makes less preservative effect. Salt texture affects mix speed; fine salt distribution faster but can clump. Stirring last step critical to avoid pockets of salt or herb mash. Store fridge only, tightly sealed. No plastic lids."
- "Don’t over process in food processor. Pulse only, short bursts. Stop and scrape. Avoid paste. Keep bites and rough chunks for texture and aroma release. Stir salt in gently, not pulse with herbs. Wait 24 hrs fridge rest to mellow flavor and moisture. Jar well sealed. Fri scents crucial. Use within 1-2 weeks max or flavor fades. Toss on cold or add just before serving in warm dishes. Not suited for cooking long. Herbs lose brightness and aroma when heated. Easy slightly coarse herb salt with punch, fast prep but attention to freshness and storage."
faq:
- "q: Why pulse herbs not blend? a: Pulsing breaks down herbs enough to release flavor but avoids paste. Blender overworks, mushy mix, aroma lost. Rough chunks keep crunch, visual appeal. Allows herbs to hold structure. Salt can clump if over blended. Stir salt last after pulsing herbs to keep consistency good."
- "q: Can I dry herbs first? a: Lightly dried maybe but fresh best. Drying loses aroma sharpness, makes mix duller. Wilted fresh herbs also bad. Use fresh or slightly wilted. If drying, don’t over dry. Crisp not brittle. Flavor changes with drying. Chive flowers best fresh or very lightly dried. Salt helps preserve but not fix dry herb flavor."
- "q: Herbs getting bitter? a: Trim stems well, tough stems add bitterness fast. Especially lemon balm, parsley stems bite stronger. Chopping size matters. Bigger pieces less bitter taste extraction. Avoid old wilted or dry herbs. Freshness key. Refrigeration slows but doesn’t stop bitter flavor development. Use within 1-2 weeks stored tightly."
- "q: Storage tips? a: Best in airtight glass jar, sealed tight. Plastic containers leak aroma, flavor dulls fast. Refrigerate always; room temp accelerates herb decay, salt moisture draws water. Leftovers keep 1-2 weeks max. Check for moisture or discoloration. Stir before use if salt settles or herbs settle. If jar wet inside, dry quickly or herbs spoil quicker."
