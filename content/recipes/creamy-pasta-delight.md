ingredients:
- "500g rigatoni"
- "3 green onions, finely chopped"
- "1 tablespoon olive oil"
- "3 garlic cloves, minced"
- "1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped"
- "150g cream cheese, softened"
- "30g grated pecorino cheese, plus more for serving"
- "200g jar of marinated artichokes, drained and chopped"
- "150g fresh kale, chopped"
- "170g shredded cheddar cheese"
instructions:
- "In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the rigatoni until al dente. Reserve 300ml of the cooking water, then drain the pasta."
- "While the pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the green onions, red bell pepper, and garlic until fragrant."
- "Stir in the cream cheese and pecorino until well mixed. Add 150ml of the reserved pasta water, stirring to create a smooth sauce. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Add the marinated artichokes and kale to the skillet. Cook until the kale is wilted. Combine the pasta with the sauce, adding more reserved water if needed to reach desired consistency."
- "Top with shredded cheddar cheese. Broil in the oven for about 5 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden."
- "Serve in bowls, garnished with extra pecorino cheese."
introduction: "Pasta with a creamy twist. Cream cheese and artichokes. Kale adds a bit of green. Sharp cheese for that punch. Good for filling meals. Quick to make. Perfect for weeknights. Pairs well with salad. Easy cleanup. Great with extra spice too. Gotta try it."
ingredientsNote: "Rigatoni is great for holding sauces. The cream cheese creates a smooth texture. Artichokes bring a unique tang. Kale is nutritious and adds color. Use fresh ingredients for the best flavor. Pecorino is a nice alternative to parmesan. Fresh herbs enhance taste. Adjust cheese quantities if you like it cheesier."
instructionsNote: "Always reserve pasta water. It's starchy and helps sauce cling. Broiling adds a nice texture to the cheese. Keep an eye on it, broilers vary. Kale can be replaced with spinach. Mix other veggies if desired. For extra flavor, add red pepper flakes. Adjust seasonings to your preference."
tips:
- "When cooking pasta, always salt your water. A lot. It makes a big difference. Use enough water too, it helps cook evenly. Rigatoni holds sauce well. Perfect for this dish."
- "Reserve pasta water, do not skip this. It’s starchy, and sauce clings better. Use it to adjust sauce consistency. Add small amounts. Mix gently to combine."
- "For extra flavor, consider red pepper flakes. Add them to boiling water or mix in the sauce. Kale can swap with spinach. Use what you have handy. Fresh ingredients matter."
- "If cheese isn’t enough, add more. Cheese can be adjusted for preference. Use different types as well. Pecorino is great. Experiment with what you like."
- "Broiling cheese creates a nice texture. Watch it closely. Broiler varies in strength. Too long, it burns. Just enough for bubbling and browning—golden color desired."
