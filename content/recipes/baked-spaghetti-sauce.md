ingredients:
- "430 g mixed ground meats (veal, pork, beef)"
- "30 ml olive oil"
- "1/4 tsp dried basil"
- "1/4 tsp dried thyme"
- "1/4 tsp dried oregano"
- "1 medium onion, chopped"
- "1 medium carrot, finely chopped"
- "25 g all-purpose flour"
- "720 ml chicken broth"
- "85 ml tomato paste"
- "1 clove garlic, minced"
- "1/4 tsp smoked paprika"
- "Salt and black pepper"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack middle position. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F)."
- "Heat half olive oil in large skillet over medium-high. Crumble meat in, season with salt, pepper, herbs. Brown till color deepens and juices evaporate, about 7-10 minutes. Drain excess fat."
- "In oven-safe pot or Dutch oven on stove, warm remaining oil. Add onion and carrot, cook slowly over medium heat until soft, translucent – think 6-8 minutes. Sprinkle flour, stir constantly for 2 minutes to form roux; no clumps, smell faintly nutty."
- "Pour in broth gradually, whisk to avoid lumps. Stir in tomato paste and smoked paprika. Bring to gentle boil, bubbling thick sauce forming."
- "Return browned meat to pot, stir in minced garlic. Cover pot tightly. Transfer to oven."
- "Cook 28-32 minutes. Sauce thickened, meat tender, fragrant herbal aromas mingling. Check color; sauce should cling to spoon. Remove from oven, adjust salt and pepper to taste."
- "Cool slightly. Serve spooned over cooked pasta or polenta. Store remainder covered in 1-litre container in fridge up to 3 days."
introduction: "Caught mid-bubble – meat sizzling, roux thickening like glue to pot sides. The way onion softens, carrot tenderizes through slow coaxing. The scent that hits you, hits deep; dried herbs waking up from the cold jar, garlic chopping into the mix, too vital here not to mention. Long oven time, 30 minutes isn’t random. Allows meat to rest in its own juices, flavor concentrations building quietly. I’ve learned tossing in paprika last minute pulls out that smoky depth—not too much, just a whisper. The courage to skip dairy or eggs, keeps sauce lean and friendly. Watch the sauce cling to the spoon, that’s been my best timer. A recipe that’s less process, more sensory dance."
ingredientsNote: "Meat blend is the backbone. Veal, pork, and beef balance fat and flavor—you can swap beef for turkey for lighter profile. Watch those labels if swapping; moisture differs. Olive oil separates cooking steps—half for meat browning, half for softening veggies. Flour dusting isn’t just for thickening but makes the sauce silkier, avoid clumps by stirring constantly. Chicken broth adds subtle complexity, vegetable broth works for veggie fans. Tomato paste is concentrated flavor, and smoked paprika swaps from original garlic punch, amplifies warmth without overwhelming. Herbs—always dry for this slow bake, herbs rehydrate better in heat. Salt and pepper last, tweak based on broth saltiness and your palate."
instructionsNote: "Preheat matters—oven must be consistent to cook evenly. Browning meat first stops it turning grey and flavorless, don’t stir too often; let edges caramelize. After browning, remove excess fat if there’s too much; greasy sauce kills texture. Vegetables soften before flour for roux foundation—a rushed roux tastes raw. Whisking broth in gradually prevents lumps. Tomato paste folded in for acidity that cuts richness. Garlic added late to preserve vibrancy; burnt garlic equals bitterness. Oven cook is patience payoff, steady heat melds everything harmoniously. Don’t rush; peek once near end, check thickness visually—if too thick, add a splash more broth. Cool slightly before serving to let flavors settle. Handy tip: save half for freezer; freezes beautifully. Always taste final sauce, salt is king of balance."
tips:
- "Brown meat till edges crisp, juices evaporating—brown well but no burnt bits. Avoid stirring constantly; let caramel spots form. Excess fat drains or sauce feels greasy. Half oil used here—one batch for meat, rest for veggies; keeps flavors distinct, controls texture."
- "Veggies slow cooked—onion then carrot, translucent and tender. Flour dusted in slowly, stir constantly. Raw flour taste kills sauce silkiness. Roux forms base, watch no lumps form while whisking in broth gradually. Low heat for patience; rushed roux smells floury, gritty."
- "Tomato paste added after liquids, not first. Helps acidity cut richness. Smoked paprika last minute pulls aroma forward without bitterness. Garlic minced, folded in late to avoid burnt sharpness, keeps aroma fresh. Herbs always dried here; slow oven rehydrates well, fresh herbs risk losing punch or becoming bitter."
- "Oven heat steady 175°C. Oven-safe pot with lid traps moisture. Sauce thickens, meat rests in juices—don’t rush or open lid early. Check thickness visually; sauce clings to spoon, not runny. Add broth splash if drying out, texture off. Oven timer flexible, 28-32 min range for texture control."
- "Swap beef for turkey or plant protein for lighter notes; moisture differs so watch cooking times, maybe add broth if drier. Broth type switches impact subtle flavor—chicken broth richer, vegetable broth lighter. Salt last always; broth salt varies. Always taste close to end."
faq:
- "q: Can I use fresh herbs? a: Fresh herbs less forgiving. Oven slow bake risks bitterness or loss of aroma. Use dried for slow meld; fresh add near end if flavor sharp needed. Depends on herb but dried safer here."
- "q: How to fix lumpy sauce? a: Lumps from flour or tomato paste not mixed well. Whisk broth gradually, stir constant when flour added. If lumps appear, blend with immersion blender or sieve sauce. Prevention better though—slow whisking matters."
- "q: What if sauce too thick? a: Add small splash broth or water. Stir, check thickness again. Thick sauce clings, but too thick feels pastey or dry. Oven dryness happens if lid loose or long cook. Cover well, peek near end only once."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool quickly. Airtight container, fridge up to 3 days. Freeze if longer; plastic containers or freezer bags. Thaw in fridge overnight or low heat. Reheat gently, stir often to avoid burning bottom. Sauce thickens in fridge; thin with broth when reheating."
