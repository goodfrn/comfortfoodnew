ingredients:
- "=== Quinoa ==="
- "140 g (3/4 cup heaped) quinoa rinsed and drained well"
- "200 g (3 cups) broccoli florets"
- "460 g (1 lb) asparagus trimmed and cut into 2-3 cm pieces"
- "1 small shallot finely diced"
- "2 cloves garlic minced"
- "30 ml (2 tbsp) olive oil"
- "40 g (3/4 cup) chopped dill fresh"
- "=== Meat ==="
- "4 pork rib chops about 2 cm thick, bone-in"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) maple syrup real grade A"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) tamari or soy sauce low sodium"
- "25 ml (1.5 tbsp) minced fresh ginger"
- "1 small shallot thinly sliced"
instructions:
- "=== Quinoa ==="
- "Heat large pot of well salted water to a rolling boil. Splash in quinoa first; listen to the little popping noises signaling water absorption starting. After 10 minutes, toss in broccoli and asparagus. Watch vegetables turn bright green, soften but hold snap. Drain everything immediately; no stewing. Shake off excess water. Keep quinoa fluffy and separate is the goal here."
- "Heat large deep skillet on medium. Add olive oil, swirl. Toss in shallot and garlic stirring until translucent and fragrant—don’t let garlic brown or bitterness creeps in. Add drained quinoa and veggies; stir for 2-3 minutes to marry flavors. Toss dill in at end, sigh at fresh piney aroma. Salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm but off heat."
- "=== Meat ==="
- "Prepare grill or grill pan set on high. Oil grates well or pork will stick like last time I forgot this. Pat pork dry, very important for good sear. Brush lightly with olive oil, season thoroughly with salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Lay on grill; should sizzle immediately. Watch for nice grill marks forming; flip after 4-5 minutes depending on thickness. Repeat on other side until pork reaches 145F internal or just firm to touch with slight give."
- "Quickly, while pork cooks, heat small saucepan to boil and simmer maple syrup, tamari, ginger, and sliced shallot together. Let reduce slightly for 5-6 minutes, syrup thickening and darkening; aroma sharp and sweet mingled. Remove shallot if you prefer smooth glaze."
- "Plate quinoa mix, nestle pork chops on top. Spoon glaze generously over meat. Serve immediately to savor shiny sticky sauce and hot tender meat against fluffy verdant quinoa."
- "Leftover maple glaze makes magic marinade or salad dressing. If no grill, sear chops in heavy skillet on high then finish in oven at 190C (375F) for 8-10 minutes with foil tent."
- "Troubleshooting: Quinoa too soft? Next time, shorten initial boil by 1-2 minutes. Vegetables mushy? Blanch separately and shock in cold water instead. Sauce too runny? Reduce longer or stir in cornstarch slurry carefully off heat to avoid clumps."
introduction: "Always a gamble getting pork chops just right over high heat. Too long, dry regret; too short, rubbery chew. Back when I ghastly charred them, I learned to oil grill bars like painting a canvas, fat touches metal, not meat. That sticky maple-ginger punch pairs with pork’s natural sweetness, but the trick? Timing sauce reduction so it’s thick but pourable, not cloying syrup disaster. Quinoa with broccoli and asparagus? The quick blanch locks bright green and snap—no soggy mush. Dill over parsley here for its sharp hint, surprising freshness. Shallots swapped for onion lowers sharp heat, makes balance more refined. Quinoa’s grain-to-veggie ratio adjusted for bite and color. Don’t overcook the greens or quinoa turns gluey; I watch color and snap, not clock. Mixed temperature pan heat, grill heat. It’s a symphony of control and instinct."
ingredientsNote: "Quinoa rinsed well removes bitter saponins; don’t skip or face a soapy aftertaste. Broccoli florets can be a mix of larger and smaller to vary texture; trim asparagus to uniform size for even cooking. Shallot brings gentler sweetness than onion; use if available or mild onion but reduce quantity slightly to avoid overpowering. Ginger always freshly minced releases more of that zing; ground powder won’t cut. Maple syrup—and real, not pancake syrup—adds depth and caramelization. Soy sauce low sodium keeps salt in check; tamari for gluten-free option. Pork chops bone-in for flavor but boneless can work; adjust cook time for thickness. Olive oil for cooking and grilling is resilient to heat. Swap dill for fresh thyme in a pinch, but flavor shifts completely. On hot grills, fat flames can flare—have a spray bottle handy to control flare-ups quickly. Every component tailored for balance, but substitutions can work with care."
instructionsNote: "Quinoa first—timing critical. Listen for gentle bubbling as water starts soaking in. When adding broccoli and asparagus, watch for that unmistakable brightening green and snap test; overboiling kills texture. Use colander with wide holes so shower rinse can stop cooking fast if you doubt doneness. Sautéing aromatics in olive oil builds flavor base—don’t skip or sous-vegetables taste flat. Stirring quinoa mix lightly keeps it fluffy. Dill added at end to prevent bitterness or dullness. Grill needs to be really hot before meat hits. If grill bars aren’t hot, pork sticks and tears; oiling prevents. Watch for internal firmness as a doneness gauge—pork should spring back but resist lightly under finger. Sauce cozies at simmer until glossy. If overcooked, turns bitter and too sticky; monitor closely, stir to avoid burn. Serve immediately, pork off heat loses juice and glaze hardens. Can finish pork in cast iron, but watch thin chops to prevent toughness. Sauce doubles as dip or dressing, a versatile bonus. Keep all cooking tools, handling steps tight; multitasking essential not to dry anything out. Trust senses—smell, sizzle, touch. These, not timers, dictate progress."
tips:
- "Quinoa timing crucial. Listen for gentle popping after adding quinoa; water absorption starts then. Add broccoli and asparagus once quinoa softens slightly but still firm. Drain fast to avoid mushy texture. Fluff quinoa off heat; clumps kill the contrast. Use wide colander holes to drain evenly and stop cooking instantly."
- "When sautéing shallots and garlic, low-medium heat first; garlic browns fast, bitterness creeps in quick. Stir often keep aromas bright not burnt. Once translucent, toss in quinoa and vegetables quickly to marry but keep separate grains. Dill goes last—too early means dull flavor."
- "Pork dry? Pat really dry before oil, don’t skip. Grill bars must be hot, oil grates thoroughly to avoid sticking. Thick chops take longer, flip once grill marks appear, watch for internal temp near 145F or springy feel with slight give, not rock hard. Pressure test predicts doneness better than timers here."
- "For glaze, boil maple syrup with tamari, ginger, and sliced shallot. Reduce on simmer, watch closely; too long burns it bitter. Remove shallot after reducing if smooth glaze preferred. Sauce glossy but pourable, not syrup thick or watery runny. Sticky balance critical."
- "Pan tricks help prevent quinoa mush and pork scorch. Medium heat on skillet; stir quinoa mix gently but consistently. When grilling, flare ups happen; keep spray bottle near. Finish pork in oven if unsure of doneness but keep covered to maintain moisture. Timing shifts with chop thickness mostly."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid mushy quinoa? a: Drain quick right after vegetables soften; overboiling breaks grains. Use colander with big holes, air it too. Stir gently after draining not hard mix, keeps separate."
- "q: Can I use onion instead of shallot? a: Yes but reduce quantity. Onion sharper, risk overpowering subtle glaze. Shallots milder, sweeter. If no shallot, slice thin or cook onion longer to mellow out."
- "q: What if pork sticks to grill? a: Oil grates thick before heating. Pork needs dry surface. Grill bars must be hot. If sticks, wait longer before flip. Or sear in skillet then finish oven baked at 190C for even cooking."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep pork and quinoa separate. Refrigerate in airtight containers. Pork glaze can coat again before reheating but sauce thickens in fridge; add splash water or soy to loosen. Use within 2 days max for freshness."
