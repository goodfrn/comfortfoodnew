ingredients:
- "1 cup frozen raspberries"
- "3/4 cups whole milk"
- "1/2 cup Greek yogurt"
- "3 tablespoons wildflower honey"
- "1/8 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
instructions:
- "Start with raspberries, milk, Greek yogurt, honey, salt, vanilla in blender jar. Used 3/4 cup milk instead of full cup; keeps sherbet dense not too runny—adjust by eye if you want thinner mix."
- "Blend 25 to 35 seconds. Stop as soon as mixture turns vibrant pink and raspberries break down fully. Over-blending crushes seeds too much; we want minimum crunch after."
- "Pour mix through fine mesh strainer set over bowl. Press firmly with spatula to get all juice out. Discard seeds. Straining crucial—no one wants tweezing raspberry seeds out frozen sherbet."
- "Transfer strained liquid into empty CREAMi™ Pint up to fill line. Leave pint lid OFF; freezing with lid traps moisture and forms peak that ruins blade. Freeze flat surface for 23-25 hours minimum. Check texture; should be fully solid but not frostbitten."
- "Once frozen solid, assemble pint in outer bowl, lock lid tight. Place on CREAMi™ motor base, twist to raise platform so blade meets pint frozen block perfectly."
- "Select 'Frozen Yogurt' program. Let motor spin, scraping sherbet smooth. If icy chunks or crumbly, use 'Respin' once. Don’t overdo respin or sherbet gets too soft."
- "Remove pint, scoop immediately. Garnish with fresh raspberries or mint leaves if desired. Lime zest or chopped pistachios add nice sharp edge. Eat fast or return to freezer upright with lid on."
- "If no CREAMi™, pour strained mixture into ice cube trays for frozen raspberry yogurty cubes. Blend briefly in food processor once frozen to mash into sherbet-like texture."
introduction: "Frozen fruit with dairy tang always tempted me but berry seeds? Nightmare. Tried crushing, no luck. This time, raspberries, cold whole milk, thick Greek yogurt, a drizzle honey not too sweet, pinch salt, splash vanilla. Blend just right—no pulverized seeds, no gritty mouthfeel. Strain with sturdy mesh; leave seeds behind. Pour in CREAMi™ pint, freeze open top—no lid trapping moisture or tips rising high to wreck blades. 24 solid hours minimum. Spin joy, Frozen Yogurt setting unlocks that silky body with subtle tang, berry brightness, honey sweetness. Learned to respin once, not twice, texture perfect. Sometimes a dash of lime zest added, unexpected pop. No CREAMi? Freeze in trays, blitz later. Kitchen-tested, kitchen-approved."
ingredientsNote: "Frozen raspberries best frozen solid, tart, aromatic. Fresh too watery, risks icy shards. Whole milk creamy but tried half & half for richer mouthfeel—too thick; yogurt dilutes nicely. Greek yogurt stands up to freezing, keeps sherbet tangy and thick, no whey separation. Honey natural sweetener, adjust by ripeness preference. Salt not skipped—lowers freezing point, balances flavors, pulls out berry brightness. Vanilla extract finishes aroma, not syrup. Sub oat milk or almond if dairy allergy—extra blend time needed, risks icy texture. Seeds always annoying; skipping straining means gritty frozen dessert, no exceptions. Use fine mesh, press hard. Freeze with lid ices tops up, breaks blades, learned that hard way. Don’t rush freezing; firm block is key for machine’s sharp spin to work properly."
instructionsNote: "Blending: watch colors shift, frothy pink signals ready. Over-blended pulp can cause seed slurry—hard to strain well. Strain step non-negotiable; press to squeeze every drop. Frozen pint prep needs steady level freeze; uneven surface causes blade wobble, uneven spin, pain in neck. Open lid freezing essential to avoid ice mounding. Assembling on machine, twist platform to blade with care; too little contact = poor texture; too much risks blade jamming. ‘Frozen Yogurt’ spin sets blade speed and timing just right for creamy finish. Respin only if icy grit remains, one time max or sherbet thaws too soft. Scoop quick after spin; if you wait, refreeze with lid on to avoid ice crystals. Nutty garnish or fresh fruit brightens dull moments. Backup plan: freezer trays, later pulse in food processor if no CREAMi available—less smooth but tastes close."
tips:
- "Strain the blend thoroughly; pressing hard with spatula gets more juice, avoids gritty seed bits frozen inside. Blend just enough pink froth shows up–overblending crushes seeds into slurry, tough to strain well. Texture depends on freezing flat surface; uneven ice causes blade wobble, choppy spin, uneven sherbet texture. Leaving pint lid off critical–traps moisture, ice peak can jam blades and ruin motor."
- "Use thick Greek yogurt not runny dairy; stands freezer cold without separating whey or turning icy. Honey acts like subtle sweetener but ripeness matters; adjust quantity. Salt pinch lowers freezing point, reduces icy hardness, brings out berry brightness. Vanilla extract adds aroma; no syrup or thicker vanilla needed. Swap oat or almond milk for dairy allergy but blend longer risks icy bits, can cause grainy mouthfeel."
- "Freezing time is key; 23-25 hours is minimum, want solid but no frostbite. Check texture before next step. Assemble pint on motor, twist platform until blade touches frozen block perfectly; too loose means poor scrape, too tight at risk blade stalls. Use ‘Frozen Yogurt’ program, lets blade slow scrape keep that dense creamy texture. Respin only once if icy chunks remain, twice and sherbet melts too soft, losing body."
- "No CREAMi? Freeze strained liquid in ice cube trays, pulse frozen cubes in food processor to mash into sherbet texture. Less smooth but close. Lime zest or chopped pistachios add fresh pop for garnish. Serve fast after spin; refreeze with lid on to avoid ice crystal formation sealing surface again. Leaving pint open during freezing important–peak forms otherwise, breaks blades. No skipping this step if you want machine intact."
- "Blend color changes key sign ready; vibrant pink, frothy light pink signals enough breakdown of raspberry pulp, seeds intact but softened. Don’t overdo. Strain step not optional–fine mesh mesh screen necessary, press until liquid almost dry. Leaving seeds means gritty crunch, ruins mouthfeel. Milk choice affects sherbet density; less milk thicker sherbet, more milk thinner. Adjust by eye but careful–too thin results in icy shards."
faq:
- "q: Why strain the mixture so thoroughly? a: Seeds frozen cause nasty crunch. Blend breaks pulp but seeds too tough. Press hard with spatula to squeeze juice. Seeds otherwise frozen, dig in teeth. No shortcut."
- "q: Can I use other milks besides whole milk? a: Yes but affects texture. Oat or almond need longer blend. Risk of icy texture higher. Half & half too thick makes sherbet heavy, yogurt thins and balances. Adjust carefully or sorbet ends up grainy."
- "q: What if sherbet is too icy after spin? a: Respin once max. Blade scrapes cold block smoother. Twice over-melts sherbet loses firmness and creaminess. Better to eat immediately or refreeze with lid on for tighter texture."
- "q: How to store leftover sherbet? a: Scoop, put in airtight container, freeze flat. Lid on avoids ice crystals but don’t leave air gaps. Good for few days. Can refreeze. Avoid thaw/refreeze cycles, destroys texture. Open top freezing only at initial step, not after spinning."
