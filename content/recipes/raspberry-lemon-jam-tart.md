title: "Raspberry Lemon Jam Tart"
slug: "raspberry-lemon-jam-tart"
description: "A rectangular tart with a crisp buttery crust, tangy lemon-raspberry filling thickened with potato starch, topped with whipped coconut cream and fresh berries. A twist on classic lemon-raspberry. Uses arrowroot and coconut cream instead of corn starch and dairy, perfect for a dairy-free variation and a silkier texture. Balances sweet and tart with a firm yet tender crust. Cooling and resting times adjusted slightly for better set and slice. Builds on lessons learned about avoiding soggy bottoms by chilling dough longer."

ingredients:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "220 ml unbleached all-purpose flour (about 1 cup plus 3 tbsp)"
- "12 ml sugar (about 2 ½ tsp)"
- "1 ml fine sea salt (about ¼ tsp)"
- "110 ml cold unsalted butter, diced (roughly 7 tbsp plus 1 tsp)"
- "1 large egg"
- "12 ml fresh lemon juice (about ¾ tbsp)"
- "2 ml vanilla extract (about ½ tsp)"
- "Ice water (only if needed)"
- "=== Filling ==="
- "100 ml granulated sugar (just under ½ cup)"
- "12 ml arrowroot powder (about 1 tbsp) — replacing cornstarch"
- "150 ml raspberry jam (approx ⅔ cup), preferably seedless"
- "100 ml fresh lemon juice (about ⅓ cup)"
- "4 large eggs"
- "110 ml unsalted butter, cubed (roughly 7 tbsp plus 1 tsp)"
- "=== Whipped topping ==="
- "120 ml canned coconut cream, chilled (about ½ cup) — replaces heavy cream"
- "25 ml powdered sugar (about 2 tbsp)"
- "Fresh raspberries (optional, for garnish)"
instructions:
- "=== Crust ==="
- "Pulse flour, sugar, salt in food processor few seconds. Add cold butter cubes; pulse until butter pieces resemble peas. Overmixing warms butter, tough crust; stop when small lumps visible."
- "Add egg, lemon juice, vanilla extract. Process briefly until dough just clumps. If dough dry, add ice water teaspoon by teaspoon; sticky dough bad news. Form dough quickly into rectangle, wrap in plastic."
- "Chill minimum 45 mins (longer if time; helps rest gluten, prevents shrinkage)."
- "On floured surface, roll dough 3 mm (1/8 inch) thick into rectangle 34 x 11 cm (about 13 ½ x 4 ½ inches). Use rimmed pan to get shape right. Patch cracks with fingers."
- "Transfer gently to removable bottom tart pan, press into corners, trim edges clean. Dock base with fork all over; stops bubbling and warping."
- "Preheat oven to 190°C (375°F) with rack low. Chill tart pan on sheet while oven warms; cold dough + hot oven = good snap."
- "Bake 18 minutes till edges golden and base is firm but not browned. If bubbling at center, prick again with fork. Let cool slightly before filling."
- "=== Filling ==="
- "In heavy saucepan, whisk sugar and arrowroot powder. Gradually add jam, lemon juice, eggs, butter cubes."
- "Cook over medium heat, whisk constantly. Mixture thickens first then looks glossy. Boil gently 1-2 min until sauce coats back of spoon; thick but pourable."
- "Strain through fine mesh sieve to catch cooked egg bits and pulp for silky texture. Pour into baked crust evenly."
- "Reduce oven to 180°C (350°F). Bake 10-12 minutes; filling slightly jiggles but is nearly set around edges."
- "Remove from oven; cool at room temperature 15 minutes, then chill uncovered at least 2 ½ hours or overnight to firm completely."
- "=== Coconut Whipped Cream ==="
- "Chill coconut cream bowl and beaters 15 minutes prior. Scoop solid cream, discard liquid or save for smoothies."
- "Whip cream with powdered sugar until stiff peaks form. Too warm? Chill and retry."
- "Pipe or spoon dollops over cold tart. Garnish with fresh raspberries for tart bursts and pop of color."
- "Serve chilled. Slicing best with knife dipped in hot water then wiped dry for clean cuts."
introduction: "Sometimes it’s all about the tart shell holding the filling firm but tender. Cold butter chunks, quick pulses, no mushy crust — that’s how I start. Lemon and raspberry go together like old friends; add a bit of natural jam instead of fresh berries inside for that easy set and full flavor punch. Arrowroot powder swapped in, better mouthfeel than cornstarch, fewer fancy ingredients but cleaner taste. Coconut cream for topping adds that airy richness without dairy’s heaviness. Watching colors change in the oven shows you when crust is spot on. Chill dough and filling properly — never skip. Learned this patching cracks and poking holes early pays off over soggy disaster. Sweet and sour balance keeps the palate interested, not slapped in the face by overpowering tang or sickly sweet. When you pipe chilled cream and scatter fresh raspberries, that’s when it smells like summer."
ingredientsNote: "Flour quality matters — unbleached is slightly stronger, gives better structure. Butter must be cold, right out of fridge, chopped just enough to leave pea-sized lumps. If dough feels crumbly, add ice water bit by bit, no more. Egg adds richness and helps bind; lemon juice brightens crust from inside. On filling, arrowroot powder replaces cornstarch for glossy finish and cleaner taste, easy that way. Use seedless raspberry jam to avoid gritty seeds sticking in teeth or messing texture. Butter folded last melts in elegantly, creating creamy mouthfeel. Coconut cream works after chilling hard part — never try with standard canned coconut milk unless whipped solid. Powdered sugar dissolves faster than granulated, avoids grainy texture in cream. Prepare toppings while tart chills; best to garnish just before serving or cream droops."
instructionsNote: "Chill dough minimum 45 minutes, longer if you can wait; elasticity improves, dough less prone to shrinkage during baking. Roll out on floured surface to 3 mm; too thin risks tears, too thick gives heavy crust. Dock well with fork to release steam, avoid bubbling or cracking. bake initial crust at 190°C until golden edges and firm base, about 18 minutes, adjust with color and rigidity rather than timer. For filling, constant whisking avoids scrambled eggs; as thickening begins, watch closely – thick, glossy coat is endpoint before boil. Strain removes bits that spoil smoothness. Bake filled tart at lower temp for shorter time to finish setting without overcooking. Chill after baking for several hours to fully firm; warm filling shreds when sliced. Coconut cream whipped cold, send you back to childhood sweet treats without heaviness. Use hot water dipped knife for neat slices; no ragged edges. Always cool tart completely before cream topping to avoid melting."
tips:
- "Pulse butter cold; tiny lumps remain so crust stays flaky. Overprocessing? Tough crust. Chill dough minimum 45 mins; longer if you can wait. Elasticity improves. Avoid shrinks. Ice water bit by bit only if dry. Don't add too much — sticky dough fails shape."
- "Dock the dough well; fork pricks stop bubbles. Roll 3 mm thick rectangle, sized for pan. Patch cracks fast with fingers or dough breaks open in oven. Don’t roll too thin; tears happen. Too thick? Heavy crust, dense bites, no snap. Keep edges trimmed clean."
- "Bake crust first 18 mins at 190°C rack low; look for golden edges and firm center, not brown. Bubbling? Poke again quick. Oven temp matters for crisp base. Chill tart pan while oven heats — dough cold meets hot air; crust snaps better."
- "Filling thickens on gentle boil 1-2 mins. Whisk constantly — no scrambled eggs. Glossy coat on spoon signals done. Strain filling through mesh to remove cooked egg bits and pulp. Prevents gritty texture; silky mouthfeel after baking."
- "Chill filling minimum 2 ½ hours after bake; slicing hot filling rips it apart. Coconut cream whipped cold; beaters and bowl chilled 15 mins prior prevent meltdown. Powdered sugar dissolves fast; avoid grainy clumps. Serve with raspberries added last. Slice with knife dipped in hot water, wiped dry; neat pieces."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute arrowroot powder? a: Tapioca starch or cornstarch similar but affects texture slightly. Arrowroot gives cleaner gloss. Use cornstarch sparingly, possible cloudiness. Tapioca thickens well but less shiny. Adjust amounts a bit based on thickening power."
- "q: What if dough cracks after rolling? a: Patch cracks quickly with fingers or small dough pieces. If too dry, add ice water tiny drops before rolling. Chill dough longer next time to improve elasticity. Avoid overmixing dough; that warms butter and breaks gluten network."
- "q: Why does crust sometimes become soggy? a: Usually underbaking or filling too wet. Dock dough well to release steam. Prebake crust till firm but not browned. Chilling dough longer before rolling can help. Also chilling pan prebake limits heat loss, encourages crispness."
- "q: How long keep leftover tart? a: Store chilled in fridge uncovered or loosely covered for up to 3 days. Topping may soften after day two. Freeze sliced tart wrapped tightly; thaw slowly in fridge. Coconut cream topping better fresh; redo if stored longer."
