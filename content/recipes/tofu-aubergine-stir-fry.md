Spicy, savory, slightly sweet, fresh herb notes. Batter-free frying, no heavy coating. Just oil, veggies, and bold flavors. House smoky waft of garlic and chili. Get cooking fast."
ingredientsNote: "Green beans trimmed for bite, not soggy but tender. Asian eggplants chosen for tender flesh and mild flavor; cut angled for surface area when frying. Tofu firm enough to hold shape, pressed to remove moisture so it crisps. Yellow bell pepper swaps original red for subtle sweet contrast. Garlic minced fine for even flavor release; bird's eye chili thin slices give heat without overwhelming. Three sauces: soy seasoning, fermented soybean paste, and vegetarian oyster sauce bring layered umami with no animal products. Brown sugar balances acidity and salt. Vegetable oil heats fast for frying layered ingredients quickly. Thai basil leaves finish dish fresh, aromatic with peppery bite. Ingredients chosen to keep recipe vegan, gluten-free, with no nuts or dairy. Adapt quantities for fewer servings if needed. "
instructionsNote: "Oil temperature critical—too cool means soggy, too hot burns. Fry green beans quickly to keep al dente, drain excess oil. Eggplant chunks need longer fry to tenderize and brown. Tofu slices fried last, 3 to 4 minutes to crisp edges, avoid flipping too often. Drain all on double-layer paper towels to soak oil. Use wok or large skillet on medium-high for stir-fry step; heat oil, then garlic, bell pepper, chili until fragrant but not burnt. Add fried ingredients, pour sauces and sugar evenly over, toss to coat well. Cook for 3-4 minutes to marry flavors, reduce some moisture but keep texture. Serve immediately with fresh Thai basil leaves torn on top. Optional rice to absorb sauces. Timing and order matter to keep textures distinct. Stir carefully, avoid breaking tofu triangles. Adjust chili quantity if less heat desired. Quick hands recommended for frying steps to avoid overcooking. "
tips:
- "Temperature control key. Too hot, burnt. Too cool, soggy. 175 °C for frying perfect. Quick fry green beans. Drain on paper towels. Keep crispy."
- "For tofu, firm type necessary. Drain well to avoid sogginess. Cut into triangles for even cooking. Fry last to prevent breaking. Crisp edges desired."
- "Choose Asian eggplants for mild flavor. Cut to angled chunks. Surface area helps with frying. Get soft texture inside. Brief frying on their own."
- "Bell pepper adds crunch. Subtle sweetness contrasts chili heat well. Slice thinly for even cooking. Garlic minced fine releases flavor faster."
- "Add sugar to balance flavors. Sweetness contrasts salty sauces. Helps mellow chili heat slightly. Incorporate during stir fry for best effect."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other vegetables? a: Yes, bell pepper could swap for zucchini. Or broccoli instead. Experiment with favorites. Mix textures."
- "q: What's the best tofu type? a: Firm recommended. Holds shape well. Silken too soft. Still can use but adjust frying time."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Consume within three days. Reheat in pan to retain crispness."
- "q: Can I freeze this dish? a: Freezing possible but textures change. Tofu may get spongy. Best fresh. If freeze, sauté before serving."
