ingredients:
- "4 eggs"
- "300 ml (1 1/4 cups) whole milk"
- "150 ml (2/3 cup) heavy cream 35 %"
- "90 g (7 tablespoons) granulated sugar"
- "5 ml (1 teaspoon) almond extract"
- "1 cranberry and pecan country loaf or raisin bread, about 500 g (1.1 lb), sliced 1 cm thick (around 16 slices)"
- "=== Frangipane ==="
- "130 g (about 9 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened"
- "110 g (3/4 cup) hazelnut flour"
- "100 g (1/2 cup) light brown sugar"
- "2 eggs"
instructions:
- "=== Custard and soak ==="
- "Set oven rack to middle position. Preheat oven to 210 °C (410 °F)."
- "Whisk eggs thoroughly with milk, cream, sugar, and almond extract in an ovenproof 28 cm (11 inch) skillet or baking dish."
- "Dip bread slices individually into the egg mixture. Let soak 4 minutes per side to absorb custard evenly."
- "Arrange soaked slices overlapping slightly in the skillet. Reserve leftover custard—will bake in."
- "=== Frangipane layer ==="
- "Using electric mixer, beat butter until fluffy."
- "Add hazelnut flour, brown sugar, and eggs. Mix until even and creamy."
- "Spread frangipane generously over topped bread slices using a spatula, filling gaps."
- "=== Bake ==="
- "Bake in preheated oven about 30 minutes until golden and custard is set."
- "Remove and cool 10 to 20 minutes before serving."
introduction: "Eggs and cream, thick and sweet. Bread soaked to squishy-soft. Custard pools around. Almond scent replaced by faint hazelnut twist. Brown sugar lends deeper caramel, sweeter than white. Cranberry-pecan loaf or rich raisins, fruity tartness inside. Frangipane slathered between slices, butter, nuts, sugar, egg, whipped bright, spread thick. Oven steams custard, browns edges, sets inside slow. A brief wait after baking cools slightly but keeps moist. Blind bake avoided, all done in one dish. Simple prep, no extra pans. Adapt flour type, fruit choice, custard flavor with no fuss. Warm, hearty brunch or casual dinner—rich texture from soak, nutty crunch waiting beneath sweet top. Mixing times fluctuate. Best served with fresh fruit or drizzle syrup."
ingredientsNote: "Egg count bumped slightly to keep custard rich with adjusted liquid. Cream increased, milk scaled back for thicker soak. Vanilla replaced with almond extract for nuttier aroma fitting frangipane twist. Using hazelnut flour instead of almond meal changes nut profile distinctly. Brown sugar swapped for deeper molasses notes, softening bite. Bread slice count increased due to thinner slices, but soak adjusted to avoid sogginess. Preserve leftover custard in pan for baking—don't pour off. Butter softened fully before whisking to create smooth frangipane texture. Measure carefully for balance of sweetness and creaminess. Avoid salted butter in frangipane to prevent flavor clash with sweetness. Bread needs sturdy texture but still absorbent; ideally day-old but not stale; fruit nuts embedded add chew and flavor bursts. Soaking times trimmed slightly to prevent mush, as added cream thickens custard. Fruit variations like dried cherry or fig elevate complexity without overpowering nutty base."
instructionsNote: "Oven rack placement affects browning and cooking time subtly; middle rack recommended. Preheat fully before assembly for even bake. Whisk eggs with liquids briskly for unified custard. Soak slices one by one, flipping gently halfway to soak evenly without tearing. Overlapping slices ensures custard pools between but reduces risk of dryness edges. Retain extra custard mixture in skillet to bake alongside bread; will firm and enrich final dish. Frangipane whipped to pale consistency avoids dense patches after baking. Spread carefully to fill gaps, sealing flavors inside. Bake time adjusted 5 minutes longer than usual to compensate for extra cream content and fruit moisture. Tester should come clean or with moist crumbs indicating complete set custard. Cooling on rack prevents soggy bottom. Rest for 10-20 minutes allows custard to stabilize and flavors to meld. Serve warm or near room temperature. Garnish with fresh berries or dust with powdered sugar as desired."
tips:
- "Use day-old bread for the best result. Thicker slices can handle the custard. Keep them sturdy but soft, not stale. Soak each slice individually. Let it absorb well but not too mushy."
- "Eggs need thorough beating. Get them fluffy with milk and cream. Mixture should be uniform. Almond extract enhances flavor. Don’t skip it. Can use vanilla but alters taste."
- "Frangipane should be creamy and light. Beat butter well. Ensure no lumps. Spread generously on soaked bread. Fill every gap; this adds moisture. Use a spatula for ease."
- "Baking time may vary. Check it well at 30 minutes. The edges should brown nicely. Testing with a toothpick is key. Clean or sticky crumbs means custard is set."
- "Let it cool before serving. 10 to 20 minutes resting helps flavors marry. Fresh fruit on top is pleasing. Optional syrup drizzle adds sweetness without overpowering."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different bread? a: Yes, use any sturdy bread. Brioche works. Even sourdough. Just place focus on texture. It should stay intact."
- "q: What if I want a vegan option? a: Substitute eggs with flax eggs. Use almond milk or coconut cream instead. Ensure butter is dairy-free. Adjust baking time as needed."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Store in the fridge. Airtight container is best. Reheat in the oven. Microwaving makes it soggy. Aim for a crisp texture."
- "q: Can I freeze this dish? a: Yes, freeze after baking. Cool completely first. Wrap tightly with foil. Reheat from frozen; bake until warmed through."
