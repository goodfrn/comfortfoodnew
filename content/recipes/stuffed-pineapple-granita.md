slug: "stuffed-pineapple-granita"
description: "Chilled pineapple halves hollowed out and filled with tropical fruit cubes. Lime granita stirred to icy crystals, sprinkled on top. Vanilla bean ice cream replaced by coconut sorbet balls. Toasted shredded coconut or fresh mint leaves for garnish. Granita made with water, sugar, lime juice, and spiced dark rum in smaller proportions. coconut sugar swapped in. Preparation includes careful pineapple sectioning and granita scraping. Serve immediately once assembled. Refreshing dessert, naturally gluten-, nut-, and egg-free. No baking needed, mostly freezing, some chopping. Time adjusted slightly to make granita less firm but still flaky."

ingredients:
- "=== Lime Granita ==="
- "180 ml (¾ cup) water"
- "45 ml (3 Tbsp) coconut sugar"
- "45 ml (3 Tbsp) fresh lime juice"
- "20 ml (1 ½ Tbsp) dark spiced rum"
- "=== Filling and Garnish ==="
- "1 whole pineapple with crown"
- "100 ml (⅖ cup) coconut sorbet"
- "Toasted shredded coconut or torn fresh mint leaves for garnish"
instructions:
- "=== Lime Granita ==="
- "1. Heat water and coconut sugar in a small saucepan until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Stir in lime juice and spiced rum. Let cool to room temperature."
- "2. Pour liquid into a shallow glass or metal container about 20 cm (8 in) square. Freeze for 5 hours, stirring every hour to break up ice crystals slightly, to keep texture flaky but not hard."
- "=== Pineapple Preparation ==="
- "3. Place pineapple flat on a board. Slice lengthwise into two halves, keep leaves attached. Use a sharp serrated or paring knife to cut just inside the rind all around the flesh without piercing the skin."
- "4. Score the flesh vertically on each side of the core. Slide knife beneath flesh sides carefully to detach from rind. Pull flesh away. Cut core into pieces and discard."
- "5. Chop pineapple flesh into medium cubes. Return cubes to hollowed pineapple halves."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "6. Scrape granita surface with a fork to create loose icy flakes. Spoon and sprinkle granita evenly over pineapple cubes."
- "7. Drop small spoonfuls of coconut sorbet scattered over the pineapple and granita."
- "8. Sprinkle toasted shredded coconut over the top or tuck torn fresh mint leaves for a fresh, herbal note."
- "9. Serve immediately to prevent melting and preserve icy texture."
introduction: "Tropical chill. Pineapple split open, edges thick, fleshy. Hollowed out but not crushed. Cubes pop like jewels, sweet and bright. Lime tang runs through icy granita, dusted finely. Sugar swapped for coconut, subtle, earthy. Dark rum instead of plain, warmer notes. Sorbet cools the tongue, coconut flavor like an island breeze. Garnish flaked coconut, toasted, or sprigs of mint torn and strewn, messy, fresh. No baking. No fuss. Freeze, slice, scrape, serve fast. Time is the friend here, waiting for crystals to form but not too hard. All clean, gluten-free, egg-free, nut-free. Just summer’s best, cold, sweet, sharp. From preparation to fork, burst of tropical sunshine. Little steps but big taste. "
ingredientsNote: "Switching coconut sugar softens the taste, less sharp than white sugar, adds warmth. Dark spiced rum instead of plain brown gives depth, slight vanilla and clove hint. Coconut sorbet brings dairy-free twist replacing vanilla ice cream for tropical vibe. Pineapple selection essential: ripe but firm, thicker rind easier for scooping without breaking. Leaves on pineapple add visual drama for presentation but can be trimmed if preferred. Toasted shredded coconut easier than large flakes, small texture contrast but not overpowering. Mint leaves optional, fresh, torn not chopped for scattered effect. Quantities tweaked: slightly less sugar and liquid for better balance with fruit sweetness, granita portion reduced to keep dessert light. Use shallow container for quick freezing and even texture formation."
instructionsNote: "Start with granita base to cool while pineapple is prepped. Heating water and sugar dissolves faster, then mix in lime and rum off heat to preserve flavors. Freeze uncovered in wide shallow dish helps faster freezing. Stirring granita every hour a twist to break big ice crystals, stops rock-hard blocks, creates small flakes. Patience needed here. Pineapple carving demands care: incision without puncturing rind keeps structure for holding filling. Score flesh near core to loosen easily. Removing core key since it’s fibrous. Chopping flesh into cubes avoids mushiness and provides textural contrast with icy granita. Granita scraped with fork last moment keeps icy texture. Adding coconut sorbet in small dollops layered across fruit and ice adds creamy cool bursts. Garnish scattered last, before serving to avoid wilting or sogginess. Serve fast. No reheating or storing, melting starts immediately. Simple clean up afterward, fruit skins can be composted. This is assembly, freezing and chopping – no actual cooking on stove needed beyond dissolving sugar."
tips:
- "Start by heating water and coconut sugar to help dissolve sugar fast. Remove from heat before adding lime juice and rum. Keep it cool to preserve fresh lime taste. Use a shallow container for granita so freezing happens quicker and ice crystals form evenly. Stir once an hour. Don’t overfreeze or granita turns hard chunks. Aim flaky texture for scoop. Patience pays off."
- "When slicing pineapple, keep leaves on for visual punch but trim if presentation isn’t needed. Cut lengthwise flat to board so it sits stable. Use serrated or paring knife close to rind but don’t pierce, this keeps shell intact for holding filling. Score flesh around core for looseness—not mushy cubes. Core’s fibrous, remove fully to avoid bitterness and texture clash."
- "Chop pineapple flesh into medium cubes. Too small turns mushy, too big hard to eat with granita flakes. Cubes should pop juicy but hold shape. Return to shell after hollowing for serving. This keeps juices in and presentation neat. Granita stays icy over cubes, layering textures contrast; juicy fruit, flaky ice, creamy sorbet."
- "Warning: Timing for freezing granita is critical. Five hours minimum, stirring hourly. Not to freeze solid or block. Want flaky but still scoopable. If too hard, let sit few minutes at room temp before scraping. Scraping with fork last minute creates those loose crystals. Add sorbet on top just before serving to keep distinct creamy bursts, not melted pools."
- "Garnish last. Toasted shredded coconut adds crunch and warmth, small flakes better than big chunks to avoid overpowering. Mint leaves torn, not chopped, scattered gives herbal freshness, sharp bursts. Avoid wet garnishes early — they wilt or sog. Serve immediately. No reheating, no storing after assembly. Fruit shell can compost for cleanup."
faq:
- "q: How to keep granita flaky? a: Freeze in shallow dish. Stir every hour. Five-hour freeze minimum. Avoid solid blocks. Scrape fork after freezing. Room temp rest if too hard. Break crystals well."
- "q: Pineapple prep tips? a: Use sharp serrated knife. Cut lengthwise. Score flesh near core. Remove core fully or fibers are chewy. Keep rind unbroken for sturdy shell. Cube flesh medium size. Avoid mushy or big chunks."
- "q: What if granita melts fast? a: Serve quick. Add sorbet last moment. No reheating. Use shallow container for freezing to control texture. Keep granita cold before assembling. Granita melts faster with room temp fruit."
- "q: Can leftovers be stored? a: Granita best fresh. Could store base before freezing, in fridge few hours though sugar may settle. Pineapple cubes hold few hours in fridge covered. Assembled dish no, melts fast. Cleanup easy, scoop shells compost."
