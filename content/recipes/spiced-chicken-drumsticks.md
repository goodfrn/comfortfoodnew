ingredients:
- "100 ml (3/8 cup) Montreal chicken seasoning"
- "22 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) packed light brown sugar"
- "12 ml (2 1/2 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "5 ml (1 tsp) cayenne pepper"
- "2.3 kg (5 lb) chicken drumsticks with skin"
instructions:
- "Combine Montreal chicken seasoning, brown sugar, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Mix thoroughly."
- "Add drumsticks to the spice mix. Toss vigorously until all pieces are evenly coated."
- "Transfer drumsticks with spices to a large sealable container or plastic bin if doubling."
- "Cover and refrigerate for roughly 15 hours or overnight."
- "Preheat a half of a gas or charcoal grill to medium-low heat, about 130 °C (265 °F)."
- "Lightly oil the grill grates just before placing drumsticks."
- "Arrange drumsticks on the unlit side of the grill to cook indirectly. Close the lid."
- "Maintain grill temperature around 130-140 °C (265-285 °F). Cook for about 1 hour 25 minutes."
- "Check periodically. Meat should be very tender and pull easily from the bone."
- "Optional: Briefly sear over direct heat for a few minutes to crisp the skin before serving."
introduction: "Chicken drumsticks. Skin on. Tossed in a mix less sweet, more smoky. Not just Montreal seasoning — add paprika and a kick of cayenne. Brown sugar tightens the crust. Marinate, no less than 12 hours. Patience. Once ready, grill on indirect heat. Slow cook. Smoke bites the meat. Juicy. Pull from the bone. Crispy skin if you want. Low and slow, not blazing flame. About 1 hour 25 minutes locked down with temp steady. Choose half a grill. Oil the grates, nothing sticks. The drumsticks soak up flavors overnight, tenderizing into something nearly fall-off-the-bone. It’s shortcuts avoided. Time invested. Simplicity here wears some attitude."
ingredientsNote: "Use skin-on chicken drumsticks for flavor and moisture retention. Montreal chicken seasoning provides a herby, garlicky base. Brown sugar adds caramelization without overpowering. Smoked paprika replaces the original creole spice, lending a warm smoky flavor. Cayenne pepper swaps for hot sauce, allowing consistent heat control and drier spice mix. Measure spices carefully — balance heat and sweet. Mix spices well before coating the meat. Large plastic bins work great for big batches. Refrigerate covered; overnight marination is best to allow flavors to penetrate deeply. This blend is free of gluten, dairy, and eggs. Adjust cayenne quantity if sensitive to spice. Drumsticks can be doubled or halved easily."
instructionsNote: "Start by mixing all dry spices in a bowl, ensuring they’re fully combined for an even crust. Add the drumsticks and toss in a large container to coat thoroughly. Marinate in the fridge for up to 15 hours. Heating the grill to medium-low indirectly prevents flare-ups and keeps the drumsticks moist. Use a half-lit grill — works for gas or charcoal — and oil the grates lightly for non-stick. Cook drumsticks on the unlit side, with lid closed, keeping temp around 130 °C. Check after an hour, then continue until the meat easily pulls from bone, about 85-90 minutes total. For crisp skin, finish with 2-3 minutes over direct heat but watch carefully to avoid burning."
tips:
- "Mix dry spices first—brown sugar clumps easy, break it up. Combine Montreal seasoning, smoked paprika, cayenne thoroughly. Dry mix—no lumps. Toss chicken in big bowl or plastic bin. Coat every piece evenly. Use skin-on drumsticks for moisture. Refrigerate covered at least 12 hours. Overnight best. Spices penetrate skin, meat tenderizes slow. Temperature control crucial. Grill too hot? Skin burns, meat tough. Aim steady 130 °C. That low heat melts fat, breaks collagen slowly."
- "Use indirect heat zone on grill. Half lit only. Keeps heat even, avoids flare-ups. Oil grill grates lightly before placing drumsticks. Prevents sticking, helps skin crisp at end. Close lid always. Keeps smoke inside. Adds smoky depth. Don’t rush. Cook about 1 hour 25 minutes, not less. Check tenderness with bone pull, not internal temp only. Meat should almost fall off bone. If skin not crisp, sear direct heat 2-3 mins max. Watch close — easy to burn fast here."
- "Brown sugar—not too much. Just enough to caramelize, form crust but not overpower. Too much sugar? Burns quicker. Smoked paprika adds warmth, slight smokiness replacing original creole spice. Cayenne replaces hot sauce here—drier, measured heat. Adjust cayenne if sensitive. Less spice for milder. Also saves stickiness of marinade—dry rub better for grilling indirect. Sealable container or large plastic bin best for mixing, keeps fridge space efficient. Avoid crowding chicken—coating uneven."
- "Marinate overnight refrigerated. Pat drumsticks dry before grilling. Moisture on skin can cause steaming not roasting. Helps achieve crispy skin at finish. Skip washing chicken after seasoning—spices penetrate best unwashed. Keep close watch last 5 minutes, skin sears quickly over direct heat. Too long? Bitter burnt taste. Charred bits ok here but avoid black ash. Rest cooked chicken before serving few minutes. Juices redistribute, meat stays moist. Avoid piercing while cooking to keep juices in."
- "Use half a grill only. Gas or charcoal both work but temp control more finicky with charcoal. Keep thermometer close to grill grate, near chicken level. Watch grill temp steadily about 130-140 °C. If temp spikes, adjust vents or flame down. Cooking low and slow breaks down collagen into gelatin, tenderizes meat slowly. High heat cooks faster but meat tougher, risk burnt crust. Large batches? Double ingredients, use bigger container but maintain same ratios carefully. Spice balance matters, no shortcuts."
faq:
- "q: How long should I marinate? a: Minimum twelve hours. Overnight preferred. Longer marinating lets spices soak in deeper. Not less than 12 or flavors stay surface level. Covered in fridge best to avoid drying or contamination. Don’t skip marinating if tender meat wanted."
- "q: Can I use boneless chicken instead? a: Possible but changes cooking time. Boneless cooks faster, less fat to keep moist. Might dry out on grill low and slow. Adjust time. Also less connective tissue to break down. Different texture. Skinless less flavor retention so adjust seasoning."
- "q: What if grill temperature fluctuates? a: Important to keep steady near 130 °C. If temp jumps higher, move drumsticks away from direct heat zone. Close lid to stabilize. Use vents to control airflow if charcoal grill. Sudden heat can burn spices, dry chicken. If temp drops too low, prolong cooking time. Patience pays off here more than speed."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Cool completely then refrigerate tight container. Keeps juices in. Eat within 3-4 days. Reheat low heat to avoid drying. Can freeze up to 2 months. Thaw overnight fridge. Avoid microwave if possible to keep texture. Use oven or grill to reheat gently."
