title: "Turkey Coriander Wontons"
slug: "turkey-coriander-wontons"
description: "Ground turkey mixed with soy sauce and finely chopped cilantro forms the filling, wrapped in wonton skins. Each wonton is sealed by moistening the edges, then pinched closed. Can freeze before cooking by first flash-freezing on parchment, then storing in a freezer bag for up to three months. Ready in around 30 minutes total, yields about three dozen. A twist swaps out fish sauce for soy sauce and coriander for cilantro, adding a subtle fresh flavor with a hint of umami. Baking or steaming options possible but frying common."
metaDescription: "Turkey Coriander Wontons are savory bites of ground turkey with a fresh kick of cilantro. Perfect for parties or freezing for later."

ingredients:
- "160 g ground turkey"
- "10 ml soy sauce"
- "20 ml chopped fresh cilantro"
- "200 g wonton wrappers"
instructions:
- "In a bowl, combine ground turkey, soy sauce, and chopped cilantro thoroughly."
- "Place approximately 5 ml of filling onto center of each wonton wrapper."
- "Dampen edges of wrapper with water, fold up and pinch firmly to seal into small bundles."
- "Optionally, freeze uncooked wontons by placing them on a parchment-lined tray until solid, then transferring to airtight freezer bag. Store up to 3 months."
- "Cook by steaming, boiling, or pan-frying. Heat until filling is fully cooked and wrappers slightly translucent or crisped, about 5-10 minutes depending on method."
introduction: "Turkey instead of pork. Soy sauce swapped in for fish sauce—less pungent but salty umami packed. Fresh cilantro chopped fine. The filling. Wontons — small, delicate pockets waiting for stuffing. Skinny wrappers folded like tiny purses. Sometimes frozen for later—keeping shape then tossing into hot water or oil, quick cooking. About thirty minutes total. Not many steps—a handful really. It’s about the pinch. Seal tight or lose the juice inside. Mix it all fast; don’t overwork. Turkey holds moisture. Soft, with a subtle herb lift. Cilantro instead of coriander — brighter, sharper notes. Soy sauce darkens, deeper than fish sauce’s funk. A little change, but notable. Little bundles, bringing layers of flavor in one bite. Minimal fuss, max taste. Probably steamed or fried. Or boiled in broth, if you like. Crunch or tender. Quick snacks or starters. Usually three dozen. Enough to share. Or not."
ingredientsNote: "Ground turkey chosen for lean protein, milder than pork, less greasy. Soy sauce offering salty richness but less fishy compared to fish sauce, suitable for milder palettes. Cilantro swapped in place of coriander leaves for a fresher, more citrusy flavor, slightly brighter. Wonton wrappers thinner, pliable, easy to fill and seal. Precise measurements balance moisture and taste—too wet filling leaks. Chopping herbs finely ensures even distribution; large pieces disrupt texture. The filling stays cohesive but tender. Wrapper quantity adjusted based on size—slightly smaller wrappers reduce filling needed, creating bite-sized morsels. This combo yields about three dozen—good for gatherings or freezing singles. Freezing process critical to prevent sticking: place on parchment sheet first, thaw fully before cooking or cook straight frozen for convenience. Not much oil in blend—lean turkey needs moisture from herbs and sauce. If mixing longer, proteins can toughen—keep it brief and gentle."
instructionsNote: "Combine all filling ingredients in a medium bowl; mix just until uniformly combined—avoid overmixing to keep filling tender. Portion filling using teaspoon or small measuring spoon for consistency—5 ml each works well. Arrange filling centers on wonton wrappers, leaving edges clear for sealing. Dip fingers in water and lightly wet wrapper edges to activate starch, which acts as glue. Fold wrapper diagonally or into purse shape, pressing firmly to seal air out and prevent opening while cooking. For freezing, arrange wontons separately on parchment paper, freeze until firm to avoid sticking, then bag tightly. Cooking options: steaming preserves tender texture; boiling softens wrappers while infusing broth; pan-frying crisps edges and adds contrast. Cook times vary by method (5-10 minutes). Serve with dipping sauces: soy-based or chili oil recommended. Keep workspace clean and dry to maintain easy handling; wet wrappers become fragile and sticky. Use sharp knife/scissors to trim any uneven edges for neat appearance. Discard wrappers if broken to avoid fillings leaking during cooking."
tips:
- "Chop cilantro finely. Small pieces. Mix filling fast to keep turkey tender. Don’t overwork. Wrappers thin, pliable. Avoid excess moisture. Use minimal oil. Watch cooking time."
- "Seal edges tight. Dampen with water for glue effect. Fold into neat shapes. Press air out. Air pockets ruin texture. Freezing options are better with parchment. Bag tightly."
- "Cook steaming. Preserves moisture. Boil for softer texture. Pan-fry for crisp edges. Cook time varies. Check for doneness and appearance. Crisp outer layer, tender inside."
- "Leftover wontons? They freeze a long time. Keep portions small. Store in bags. Longer means loss of quality. Thaw fully before cooking. Cook frozen for convenience."
- "Dip into sauces. Soy and chili oil are tasty. Flavor complements well. Always keep workspace dry. Wet wrappers become fragile. Check for even edges before cooking."
faq:
- "q: How do I prevent wontons from sticking? a: Use parchment for freezing. Arrange separately. Keep them spaced. Stickiness is a common issue. Avoid a mess."
- "q: What if my filling is too wet? a: Adjust with less soy sauce next time. Drain excess moisture. A bit of cornstarch could help. Balance is key for texture."
- "q: Can I use other proteins instead? a: Yes, chicken or pork can work. Adjust seasonings as needed. Each brings a different flavor profile. Experimenting is worthwhile."
- "q: Storage tips for cooked wontons? a: Refrigerate in airtight containers. Use within a few days. Freezing is also an option. Wrap tightly before freezing."
