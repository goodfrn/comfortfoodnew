slug: "lenten-brioche-apricots"
description: "Yeast dough enriched with eggs and butter, studded with plump golden raisins and chopped dried apricots. A soft, slightly sweet bread shaped into 12 individual buns, risen until puffed and baked until golden brown. A simple sugar glaze with a touch of milk piped in crosses on top, adding a subtle finish. A slight cinnamon aroma in the dough, balanced sweetness, and chewy dried fruit bits throughout. Yeast fermentation takes time but yields airy texture. Serve warm with butter or plain. Adapted from a classic brioche for Lenten celebrations. Minor ingredient swap: honey replaces half the sugar and cardamom replaces cinnamon for an aromatic twist."

ingredients:
- "=== Brioche ==="
- "135 ml warm milk (1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp)"
- "4 large eggs"
- "350 g all-purpose flour (2 1/3 cups)"
- "70 g sugar (1/3 cup)"
- "5 ml instant yeast (1 tsp)"
- "3 ml salt (1/2 tsp)"
- "2.5 ml ground cardamom (1/2 tsp)"
- "160 g unsalted butter, softened, cut in cubes (about 2/3 cup)"
- "110 g golden raisins"
- "100 g dried apricots, finely chopped"
- "15 ml honey (1 tbsp)"
- "=== Glaze ==="
- "120 g powdered sugar (3/4 cup)"
- "20 ml milk (4 tsp)"
instructions:
- "=== Dough preparation and mixing ==="
- "1. Butter a 33 x 23 cm rectangular pan and line with parchment paper, leaving edges overhang."
- "2. Stir milk, eggs, and honey in a clean bowl. Set aside."
- "3. In a stand mixer bowl fitted with dough hook, combine flour, sugar, yeast, salt, cardamom. Mix dry ingredients briefly."
- "4. Add wet ingredients and mix on medium speed until dough begins forming, about 2 minutes."
- "5. Incorporate softened butter piecewise, mixing continuously until fully integrated, about 6 minutes. The dough should be shiny and elastic."
- "6. On a floured surface, fold in raisins and chopped apricots. Knead gently 1 minute to distribute evenly."
- "=== Rising and shaping ==="
- "7. Divide dough into twelve equal pieces, approximately 80 grams each."
- "8. Shape each into a ball by rolling under your palm on a lightly floured surface."
- "9. Place balls evenly in prepared pan, spacing slightly apart."
- "10. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest in a warm spot until dough doubles in size and buns touch, about 2 hours 15 minutes. Timing may vary with room temperature."
- "=== Baking ==="
- "11. Preheat oven to 205°C (400°F) placing rack in center."
- "12. Lightly brush the tops of buns with water using a pastry brush."
- "13. Bake for 20-22 minutes, until deep golden and feel hollow when tapped."
- "14. Remove from oven and cool 15 minutes in pan."
- "=== Glazing and finishing ==="
- "15. Whisk powdered sugar and milk to a smooth glaze."
- "16. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a fine round tip."
- "17. Pipe crosses over each bun’s top allowing glaze to set before serving."
- "18. Serve warm with salted butter or plain."
introduction: "Frosted crosses on golden buns. Rich dough studded with fruit, lightly spiced. This variant takes the traditional Lenten brioche but swaps half sugar for honey for a subtle floral note, swaps cinnamon for cardamom — fragrant, slightly citrusy. Dough feels sticky — keep dusting flour sparingly, no tough cracking crust wanted. Raisins swell during rising, apricots soften yet hold shape. Time matters. Not hurrying rise gives air and flavor. Buns snug together, baking glimmer. Warm, with cow’s butter melting. Simple glaze adds sweet sheen and marks shape. Pieces to tear apart, not too dense, not too crumbly. Dessert and bread. Break fasting nicely. Satisfying yet light."
ingredientsNote: "Warm milk less than usual to preserve yeast activity but avoid scalding eggs. Honey added partly instead of sugar for moisture-retaining sweetness and slight complexity, works with yeast well unless very active. Cardamom replaces cinnamon for a fragrant twist — powder fine, fresh ground preferred. Butter softened, not melted, to get silk smooth dough without oily spots. Flour slightly reduced from original to keep dough tender, helps hydration balance with honey. Raisins golden, fruity and plump, chopped apricots diced small for even distribution and bite contrast. Glaze thickens enough to pipe but softens over time. Adjust milk amount to get glaze consistency that holds shape but not stiff."
instructionsNote: "Prepare pan first for easy removal. Mixing order key: dry then wet, then butter added gradually for baker’s dough strength. Knead in mixer short but intense for gluten development. Finished dough shiny, barely sticky. Add fruit last with light knead, fruit distribution essential so not bunched or sparse. Rest and rise covered, room temp usually 2 to 2.5 hours, patience required for air and volume; dough doubles, buns join sides gently. Oven hot, rack central for even bake, brush water on top pre-bake to enhance crust color but not make soggy. Bake 20 to 22 minutes, check early last 5 to avoid burning. Cool not fully then glaze. Glaze applied via piping bag for neat defined crosses, classic Easter symbol. Serve warm; sets glaze but keeps bun tender inside. Leftovers store wrapped at room temp, gently reheat."
tips:
- "Don’t rush the rising time. Temperature affects dough. Warmer space helps, cooler slows down. Wait until doubled. It gives nice texture. Air pockets form well this way. Shape matters too."
- "Use room temp ingredients. Cold eggs or butter can slow things down. Yeast loves warmth. Check the milk too. Too hot kills yeast, too cold does nothing. Test before mixing. Let eggs sit out."
- "Glaze consistency is key. Not too thick, not too runny. Adjust milk by small amounts. Or add powdered sugar. Use a piping bag for clean crosses. Let them set before serving."
- "Knead well but light. Too much can toughen dough. Just enough for gluten. Look for a smooth and elastic texture. Avoid adding too much flour. It can make buns dense instead of fluffy."
- "Use fresh spices for flavor. Cardamom packs a punch. Smell the spice before using. Old spices lose aroma, flavor fades. Keep them sealed and cool. Fresh means better flavor in the end."
faq:
- "q: What if the dough doesn’t rise properly? a: Check yeast freshness. Old yeast fails. It should bubble in warm water. If nothing, start over. Temperature matters again. Too cold is slow."
- "q: Can I substitute with other dried fruits? a: Yes, options are many. Use cranberries, or figs instead of apricots. Balance flavors for mixing though. Each gives a different result."
- "q: How do I store leftover buns? a: Wrap them in foil. Keep at room temperature. They last a few days. For longer, freeze them. Thaw slowly before reheating. Keeps flavor intact."
- "q: What if my glaze is too thick? a: Add a few drops of milk gradually. It’ll help thin out. Mix until smooth but thick. If too runny, more sugar fixes it. Adjust slowly."
