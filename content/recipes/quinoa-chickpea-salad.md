slug: "quinoa-chickpea-salad"
description: "A vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free quinoa salad tossed with crunchy toasted walnuts replacing almonds, spiced chickpeas seasoned with smoked paprika and cumin, fresh shaved fennel, and peppery arugula. Finished with a creamy cashew-avocado dressing instead of yogurt for a nutty twist. Keeps well, stays vibrant. A mix of cool, crisp, nutty, and smoky. Texture is everything here: quinoa fluff vs crunchy nuts vs juicy chickpeas. Timing leans on visual and tactile signals more than strict minutes. Quick to assemble, great for weeknights and batch meals."

ingredients:
- "190 g (1 cup) quinoa rinsed and drained"
- "90 g (1/2 cup) walnuts coarsely chopped, toasted in pan"
- "50 ml (3 tbsp) extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 can 400 ml (14 oz) chickpeas rinsed, drained"
- "3 ml (3/4 tsp) smoked paprika"
- "2 ml (1/2 tsp) ground cumin"
- "1 fennel bulb thinly shaved with mandoline"
- "80 g (3 cups) arugula"
- "Cashew avocado dressing 200 ml"
- "Fresh basil leaves for garnish"
- "Fresh mint leaves for garnish"
- "Juice of 1 lemon"
instructions:
- "Rinse quinoa under cold water till water runs clear. Bring salted water to boil, add quinoa, lower heat to gentle simmer. Cook 10-13 minutes until grains become translucent and small spiral detaches when pinched. Drain immediately, rinse briefly with cold water to stop cooking. Drain thoroughly—wet quinoa means mushy salad."
- "While quinoa steams, heat olive oil in skillet over medium-high. Toss in walnuts first —don’t skip toasting, enhances nuttiness and crunch. After 2 minutes, add chickpeas and toast stirring frequently. Look for golden brown spots—listen for faint crackle and sizzling. Sprinkle smoked paprika and cumin. Stir to coat, cook another minute. Salt and pepper now, or seasoning won’t stick well. Remove from heat before chickpeas get too dry or burnt."
- "In large bowl, combine quinoa, shaved fennel (crisp, juicy with a mild anise punch), and arugula. Pour 150 ml cashew avocado dressing over. Squeeze lemon juice to cut richness and brighten flavours. Toss gently but thoroughly. Taste for salt and acidity — salad needs balance. Add more dressing if too dry or lemon if flat."
- "Plate salad in shallow dishes, mound walnut-chickpea mixture on top—serves bite contrast: creamy quinoa, crunchy chickpeas and nuts, crisp veggies, peppery leaves. Scatter basil and mint leaves for fresh herbal lift, torn into bite sizes. Add an extra dollop of dressing on each plate just before serving."
- "If you want extra punch, sprinkle chili flakes or add thin slices of green apple for sharp freshness next time. Make ahead? Hold walnut mixture separate. Salad keeps up to 2 days refrigerated but add dressing fresh to maintain bright texture."
introduction: "Wait, quinoa with crunch? Yes. Walnuts for that toasty snap, chickpeas spiced and crisped in a pan, fennel thinly shaved to just melt but with bite, arugula for peppery note—they all clash and blend at once. Not your boring grain salad. I learned to watch quinoa—not by timer but look for those tiny curls, little pearls bursting. That tell-me moment when it’s done. Toasting walnuts instead of almonds changes everything—more depth, more grease resistance. The chickpeas? Listen for that pop and sizzle, browned, never sad beige mush. Spices swapped, cumin enters stage left adding warmth, goes well with smoke paprika’s burnt ember feel. Then the dressing swap—cashew, avocado blended luscious, dairy-free creaminess that clings but doesn’t drown. Lemon brightens, wakes it up. I always add herbs last, tearing basil and mint chunky, because chopping makes them sad. Salads can’t be soggy, dull, or all one note. Not here. Timing? Don’t trust your clock—trust your senses: a crunch, a smell, a look. This salad keeps well in the fridge as long as you keep nuts separate. Lunch prepping made easy. The textures, smoky and fresh, live together in each bite. Tried it last week doubled the cumin, loved the deep earthy vibe that brought. Salads aren’t boring when you get into it."
ingredientsNote: "Quinoa rinsing is critical—removes saponins, those bitter soapy things that can ruin your salad. Use pearl quinoa for quicker cook or red quinoa for nuttier taste but adjust times and don’t overcook or you’ll lose crunch. Walnuts swapped for almonds here—they toast faster and break up more easily under the teeth, plus they add a deeper earthy tone. Olive oil is your cooking fat; neutral oils or avocado oil work too but olive oil gives that slight peppery finish. Chickpeas from cans preferred for ease but if using dried, pre-soak overnight, boil 45 minutes loosely covered until tender yet firm, then try the skillet step right after draining well. Smoked paprika and cumin are flexible—you can use regular paprika with a pinch of chipotle or cayenne to mimic deeper smokiness. Fennel sharpness varies by season; thin slices on mandoline balance texture without overwhelming. Greens like arugula add pepper and crunch; baby spinach or watercress can substitute but adjust dressing acidity accordingly. Cashew avocado dressing keeps it dairy free and creamy, but a tahini dressing with lemon and garlic could work if avoiding avocado. Basil and mint add cooling herbal notes; fresh is best but dried won’t do here. Lemon juice is a secret weapon to freshen and cut the richness that avocado dressing imparts, make sure it’s bright and balanced. Avoid over-dressing or you’ll drown the quinoa texture."
instructionsNote: "Quinoa cooking isn’t just about time. Watch the grains—once you see the little white ring or tail emerge from the seed, it’s telling you it's done. Overcooking turns it to mush, undercooking leaves hardness. Drain, then rinse cold quickly to stop cooking and keep firm; wet quinoa turns gluey in salad. Skillet heat should be medium-high but watch the nuts and chickpeas closely to avoid burning; stir often but not too violently to preserve the walnut chunks. You want to hear a gentle sizzle, see a golden patina develop on chickpeas, not black spots. Spice addition timing matters: adding paprika and cumin last minute prevents bitter burnt powders. Season with salt after spices stick for better flavor adhesion. Toss the salad gently but don’t bruise the greens—use large bowl and fold motion. Add dressing gradually; better to add more if needed than have a swimming salad. Herbs are final touch—tear into pieces with your hands rather than chopping; chopping bruises and dulls aroma. Plate in shallow bowls to showcase layering: quinoa base, feature veggies mixed, topped by spiced nuts and chickpeas for texture contrast. Allow salad to rest 5 minutes before serving; flavors meld subtly. Leftovers? Keep nuts separate to stay crunchy, re-season salad before eating as acidity fades with time. This dish encourages tweaking; swap nuts, adjust spice level, add sweet tang with sliced green apple or dried cranberries for interest."
tips:
- "Rinse quinoa thoroughly. Those saponins—bitter, soapy. Pearl quinoa cooks faster; red quinoa gives nuttier bite but watch cook times. Drain and rinse cold immediately after cooking to halt. Wet quinoa = mushy salad. Don’t skip that twice rinse."
- "Walnuts toast fast, watch skillet closely. Medium-high heat but be ready to stir often. Want golden brown, gentle crackles, not burnt spots. Chickpeas go in after a couple minutes walnuts. Listen for pops, that faint sizzle means ready to spice up. Add smoked paprika and cumin last moment to avoid burnt bitterness."
- "Fennel sliced thin on mandoline—not shredded or chopped—adds crisp snap and a breeze of anise aroma balancing smoky, nutty tones. Toss with arugula just before serving. Greens bruise fast so fold gently. Baby spinach or watercress can swap but dressing acidity may need adjustment."
- "Dressing matters—cashew avocado keeps creamy, dairy-free. Pour gradually, test texture, acidity balance with lemon juice—brightens and cuts richness. Avoid drowning quinoa; better to underdress and add later than soak grain. Tahini-based dressing can swap but expect different texture and flavor depth."
- "Keep nut and chickpea mix separate if prepping ahead. Nuts soften fast in fridge, lose crunch quickly. Add dressing fresh just before serving. Herbs torn by hand, not chopped, release more aroma and avoid bitterness. Basil and mint fresh only—dried leaves dull intensity and texture."
faq:
- "q: How to know when quinoa is done? a: Watch for tiny white spiral tails popping off. Grain turns translucent. Time varies but don’t guess dinner timer. Overcook mush, undercook hardness. Rinse cold right after draining or continue cooking in residual heat."
- "q: Can I swap walnuts with other nuts? a: Yes, but consider texture and flavor shifts. Almonds slower toast, less oily. Pecans sweeter, softer. Toast same way but watch timing. Each nut changes mouthfeel, so test small batch first. Also consider allergies."
- "q: What happens if chickpeas burn? a: Bitter off taste ruins balance fast. If smell turns acrid pull pan off heat. If beginning to burn, add more oil or lower heat next round. Alternatively use canned chickpeas different brand or rinse thoroughly. Avoid too dry skillet."
- "q: How to store leftovers properly? a: Keep nuts and chickpeas separate from greens and quinoa, dressing separate too if possible. Refrigerate in airtight containers. Salad best within 2 days. Add fresh lemon juice when serving to brighten dull flavors. Cold greens bruise quickly so gentle handling important."
