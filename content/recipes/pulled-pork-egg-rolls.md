ingredients:
- "1 tbsp paprika"
- "1 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "2 tsp kosher salt"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 tsp dried thyme"
- "1 tsp onion powder"
- "1 tsp dried parsley"
- "2 tbsp honey"
- "4 pork shoulder slices"
- "2 cups sliced onion"
- "1/4 cup apple cider vinegar"
- "1/3 cup apple cider (or substitute white wine/broth)"
- "8 oz shredded smoked gouda (swap smoked cheddar or fontina if desired)"
- "24 egg roll wrappers"
- "1 egg"
- "1 tbsp water"
- "Vegetable oil (for frying, about 2 inches deep)"
instructions:
- "=== Pulled Pork Preparation ==="
- "Mix paprika, cayenne, salt, garlic powder, thyme, onion powder and parsley in a small bowl until evenly blended. Add honey and work into a spreadable paste; this helps caramelize and adds balance to smoky paprika. Slather onto pork slices, focusing on the meaty sides. Skip fat layer if thick."
- "Spread sliced onions on slow cooker bottom, pour cider vinegar and cider over. The acid tenderizes pork gently, adding brightness to rich meat. Layer pork shoulder on top, paste side up to avoid the sweet rub dissolving into liquid too fast."
- "Set cooker on high for about 3 hours and 15 minutes. Key is pork falls apart easily without shredding into mush. Shake or poke to test doneness—if meat resists, cook slightly longer. Careful, too long and texture suffers. Juice should bubble gently, not boil or dry out."
- "Use forks to shred pork in bowl, strain and reserve 1/4 cup of slow cooker liquid. Skim off any floating fat to keep egg rolls from greasiness. Mix shredded pork, onions, and reserved liquid. The onions stay tender but with some bite, liquid keeps filling moist but not soggy. Let cool enough to handle without steaming your fingers."

- "=== Egg Roll Assembly and Frying ==="
- "Beat egg with water in small bowl to make egg wash; ensures wrapper sticks well and seals tight, prevents leaking oil or filling."
- "Lay one egg roll wrapper down like a diamond shape. Brush beaten egg liberally on all edges; corners especially, so no filling escapes under frying pressure."
- "Spoon a heaping 1/4 cup pulled pork and about a tablespoon smoked gouda onto center. Don't overpack or risk bursting. Balance cheese and meat to avoid greasy puddles or dry rolls."
- "Fold bottom corner over filling tightly, then fold sides in with some pressure to trap filling. Roll upward keeping shape compact. Seal edges with egg wash, double-check for gaps or thin spots."
- "Repeat for all wrappers, placing finished rolls on wax paper to prevent sticking together. Take breaks if fryer not hot yet—wrappers dry out and crack."
- "Heat 1 to 2 inches vegetable oil in heavy-bottomed pot or dutch oven. Temperature crucial at 375 degrees F, use thermometer. Too low, soggy shells absorb oil; too high, outsides burn before inside cooks through."
- "Fry 2 to 4 egg rolls at a time, managing space so oil temperature doesn’t drop suddenly. Turn gently after 2 to 3 minutes when edges crisp and color deep gold. Total frying about 4 to 6 minutes per batch."
- "Remove with slotted spoon onto paper towels laid on baking sheet to drain excess oil. Store on a warm oven rack if holding for a few minutes. Do not stack fresh rolls or wrappers soften, lose crisp."
- "Serve warm with avocado green goddess dressing or any creamy tangy dip. Fresh cilantro or lime zest boosts brightness. A squeeze of hot sauce is optional but recommended from experience."

introduction: "Cooking pulled pork with a honey-spiced rub smothered on shoulder cuts. Apple cider and vinegar soften tough meat while flavors meld overnight in slow cooker. Shredded pork pairs with smoky gouda tucked inside egg rolls—a crunchy, melty contrast. Tried switching cider for broth, still good but cider’s tang brings a pop. Learned to keep oil just right; hot enough for a shatter crisp outer shell but gentle to avoid charred outsides. Testing fork-pull tenderness beats timing—pork toughness ruins texture. Onion’s sweetness mingles with pork’s savor, cheese melts into gooey pockets. Hand-rolling egg rolls messy but satisfying; egg wash is sticky glue. Fry in small batches to maintain oil temp, drains well if paper towels work, no greasy puddles—always check edges for blistered golden-brown perfection. Bonus: leftovers taste even better the next day."
ingredientsNote: "Paprika group spices vary by brand strength; adjust cayenne cautiously for heat level, I dial back often. Honey replaces some sugar, aids caramelization and mouthfeel—too much, gums up slow cooker. Cider is acid and moisture; if unavailable, dry white wine or even chicken broth works but shifts flavor profile - a more savory base instead of fruity brightness. Cheese choice flexible: smoked gouda is ideal, but smoked cheddar adds punch; fontina melts creamy if prefer less smoky depth. Egg roll wrappers can dry quickly; keep covered with damp towel if assembling slowly. Vegetable oil preferred neutral frying oil—avoid olive oil due to low smoke point. Always skim fat from pork liquid; too oily fills and oil absorption ruins crispy exterior. Don't skip egg wash, its sticky protein network seals tightly, no oil seeping in. Onion slices bottom layer radiate aroma, slowly caramelizable if left long enough."
instructionsNote: "Start spice paste well blended, honey evenly distributed avoids sticky clumps on pork. Slather pork to trap rub flavor inside meat surface; exposes maximum spice contact. Placing onions and vinegar base spreads acid contact, moisture evenly, prevents pork drying out. Set cooker without lid shifts heat dissipation; 3 plus hours on high is guideline, fork tender test mandatory, meat fibrousness signals readiness. Shredding combined with reserved liquid rehydrates meat without excess moisture; don’t oversoak or filling gets mushy, ruins wrapper integrity. Egg roll assembly best on clean surface; brush edges uniformly to ensure seal but not so much drip that wrappers get soggy edges. Filling measured to avoid overstuffing, that leads to leakage during frying. Oil must be hot enough for immediate bubbling when rolls enter. Frying time based on color and audible bubbling intensity—deep golden with tiny crackles on surface is done. Drain thoroughly on paper towels to prevent residual oil. Holding warm in oven prevents soggy outcomes. Leftovers reheat in air fryer or oven for crisp revive. Keep kids or pets out of kitchen when frying; hot oil splash danger real."
tips:
- "Spice paste needs thorough blending; honey must distribute well to avoid sticky clumps that burn on pork surface. Spread paste evenly, no skipping thick fat layers if thin. This traps heat and flavor in meat, makes rub sticky and helps caramelize."
- "Start onions on bottom slow cooker, pouring cider vinegar and cider over. Acidity breaks down tough pork fibers but avoid too much liquid or pork falls apart and gets soggy, balance with timing and layering order is key."
- "Oil temperature crucial—keep steady at 375F. Using thermometer is non-negotiable. Too low oil means soggy shells, oil soaks in; too hot burns outside before center cooks. Fry small batches, wait for oil to recover temp, hear bubbling intensify edges for doneness."
- "Egg wash must cover all edges thickly; no shortcuts. Corners leak easy otherwise during frying, oil invades wrapper, causing soggy spots or bursts. Brush liberally but avoid dripping onto filling or wrapper bottom, that encourages oil absorption."
- "Rest pork after shredding with reserved cooking liquid mixed in, but avoid oversoaking. Keeps filling moist, onions tender with bite. Overwet filling = wrapper soggy, falls apart on frying. Cool filling enough or temperature differences mess with sealing and frying crisp."
faq:
- "q: Can I replace smoked gouda? a: Yes. Smoked cheddar works for deeper sharpness. Fontina melts creamier, less smoky. Swap changes texture and flavor mouthfeel but keep cheese amount steady to avoid greasy roll filling."
- "q: How do I know pork is done without timing only? a: Fork tender test works better. Shake meat in cooker if resists, add time. Juices should bubble gently, no hard boil. If too dry, meat gets stringy. Don’t rush, texture over clock."
- "q: Wrappers got soggy after frying, why? a: Oil temp too low, slow frying sucks in oil. Skim fat from pork liquid to reduce greasiness. Don’t overfill rolls. Egg wash seal tight; gaps let oil sneak in. Drain on paper towels immediately. Never stack fresh."
- "q: What’s best way to store leftovers? a: Cool rolls completely then refrigerate in single layer or parchment lined. Microwave soggs shells; oven or air fryer reheats better for crunch. Freeze wrapped airtight, reheat crisp in oven or fryer. Don’t let sit warm stacked."
