- "12 sheets filo pastry thawed"
- "1 tsp ground cinnamon"

instructions:
- "Set oven rack low. Preheat oven to 185 °C (365 °F)."
- "Mix apple slices with sugar cinnamon ground ginger and calvados in a bowl. Let sit."
- "Lay 6 sheets filo on clean surface stacking, brushing each with coconut oil. Trim edges to fit a 28 cm (11 inch) springform pan allowing 1.5 cm (3/5 inch) overhang."
- "Press filo into pan, trimming excess but leaving a small border to fold over later. Hold back scraps."
- "Spread soaked apples evenly over filo base. Fold border loosely toward center overlapping slightly."
- "Brush remaining 6 filo sheets with oil. Cut each into 3 strips about 43 cm (17 inches) long."
- "Arrange strips vertically over apples curling to create height and layered texture. Scrunch or twist strips for an airy, rustic look."
- "Bake 40 to 45 minutes until bottom is crisp and golden brown. Check halfway to ensure even color."
- "Cool slightly before loosening sides carefully. Serve warm or room temperature."
introduction: "Filo sheets stacked crisp and golden. Apples drenched in apple brandy, cinnamon, tangled into layered curls. A snapshot of fall flavors held in a fragile pastry. No eggs or nuts complicate or weight this down. Butter replaced—coconut oil steps in, burns with a clean crunch. Shape rough, rustic, every slit and fold unique. Calmly assembled but baked lively. The bottom firm, the topping fluttering. Sweet tartness with a warm snap of spice. Calm afternoon or after dinner dessert. Fork breaks through crisp shells, apple softness underneath. No fuss, just texture contrast and flavor depth. The lift of filo savory not sweet per se, carries fruit like ribbons. A glimpse of French countryside in simple ingredients. Try with a sprinkle of powdered sugar or a shot of espresso. Holds for next day, better actually. Filo keeps crisp even after resting. An impression rather than a statement, casual but layered."
ingredientsNote: "Apples choice crucial: tart Granny Smith or Cortland, peeled and sliced thin for even cooking. Brown sugar adds a caramel undertone, less harsh than white sugar. Calvados chosen for apple note and aromatic richness, Armagnac swapped here for subtle difference. Butter replaced by coconut oil for dairy-free and lighter finish. Spices cinnamon and ginger add complexity, ginger slight peppery heat meets sweet. Filo sheets delicate—handle with care, brush each layer thinly with oil for crisp texture and golden color. Cutting filo strips uniformly is key to maintain consistent baking and visual effect. Remainders great for crispy bits on salads or soups. Chill them, keep covered to avoid drying. These ingredients keep the dessert vegan-friendly while maintaining classic French countryside charm."
instructionsNote: "Preheat oven low on bottom rack for crisp base. Combine apples with sugar and spices first, let them macerate briefly to soften slightly. Grease each filo sheet with oil lightly but fully to avoid dry spots and cracking. Layer carefully in pan without stretching filo. Fold excess edges back towards center for a rustic basket effect. Arrange strips vertically over apples to create airy puff, twisting or bunching for texture. Bake patiently 40–45 minutes watching color, avoid dark edges. Cool briefly to firm up base before loosening sides with a sharp knife. Can serve warm or room temp—texture changes subtly with temperature. Use carefully chosen pan with removable bottom for ease or line with parchment to avoid sticking. Saves stress serving intact wedges with subtle crisp and tender fruit in every bite."
tips:
- "Handle filo gently. Sheets dry fast. Thaw fully but keep covered. Use a damp towel. Brush each layer lightly with melted coconut oil. Too much oil ruins crispness. Don’t slop it on. Thin, even coating only."
- "Slice apples thin for even cooking. Granny Smith firm, tart. Peel and core before cutting. Mix with sugar, calvados, cinnamon, ginger quickly. Let sit max 10 minutes. Avoid soggy layers—some juice good for steam."
- "Arrange filo base on springform pan with overhang edges for folding. Cut edges to fit but keep slight overhang. Press gently, avoid stretching fragile sheets. Fold edges loosely after spreading apples for rustic edge. Don’t seal tight, let steam escape."
- "Cut top filo sheets into long strips about 43 cm. Brush oil. Twist or scrunch when laying over apples. Creates height and layered texture. Airy, rough look. Layering strips instead of flat top prevents soggy covering. Check strips length carefully."
- "Bake low and slow, bottom rack for crisp base. 40-45 minutes. Check at 35 mins for color variation. Golden brown, no dark spots. Cool 10 minutes before removing sides. Hot fragile and breaks. Serve warm or room temp retains crisp shell and soft interior."
faq:
- "q: Can I substitute calvados? a: Yes. Armagnac works too. Bourbon if needed. Flavors shift. Apple note less strong with bourbon. Keep quantity same. Adjust spices if desired. Calvados chosen for apple essence specifically."
- "q: How to handle filo without tearing? a: Thaw sheets completely but keep covered with damp towel to avoid drying. Work quickly. Brush oil thinly on each sheet. No stretching, lay flat gently. If a sheet tears, can patch with scraps or layer extra. Fragile stuff."
- "q: Can I prepare ahead and store? a: Assemble and refrigerate up to few hours covered. Filo loses crispness stored long. Best fresh bake. Leftovers store in airtight container room temp 1-2 days. Reheat briefly in oven to restore crunch somewhat."
- "q: What if bottom isn’t crisp after baking? a: Oven temp too low or rack too high. Should bake on low rack for crisp base. Check oven calibration. Reduce moisture too. Avoid excess apple liquid. Brush filo layers well with oil. Could bake longer if needed but watch color."
