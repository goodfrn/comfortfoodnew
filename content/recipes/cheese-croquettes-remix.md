slug: "cheese-croquettes-remix"
description: "Cheese croquettes made with ricotta and smoked mozzarella instead of cottage and gruyere, plus chopped walnuts replacing almond meal. Basil swapped for thyme, added ground cumin for a twist. Quantity adjustments reduce cheese cottage to 120 ml, increase breadcrumbs to 100 ml. Bake time tweaked slightly longer, crispier finish. Four servings are enough for a veggie main. Great with green salad or grilled seasonal veggies like zucchini and bell peppers."

ingredients:
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) ricotta cheese"
- "310 ml (1 1/4 cup) smoked mozzarella, grated"
- "100 ml (1/2 cup) breadcrumbs"

- "125 ml (1/2 cup) walnuts, finely chopped"
- "5 ml (1 teaspoon) fresh thyme, chopped"
- "10 ml (2 teaspoons) fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped"
- "1 pinch ground cumin"
- "1 egg, beaten"
- "Salt and pepper"
instructions:
- "Set the oven rack in the middle position. Preheat oven to 185°C (365°F)."
- "Mix ricotta, smoked mozzarella, breadcrumbs, green onions, walnuts, thyme, parsley, ground cumin, and beaten egg in a bowl. Salt and pepper to taste."
- "Form mixture into 4 even croquettes. Arrange on a greased baking sheet, spacing apart."
- "Bake for about 15 minutes until firm on the outside."
- "Switch oven to broil. Broil croquettes 3-4 minutes until golden brown on top."
- "Serve with fresh green salad or grilled seasonal vegetables such as asparagus, zucchini, or bell peppers."
introduction: "Cheese croquettes reimagined. Ricotta for softness. Smoked mozzarella adds a savory twist. Walnuts give texture, crunch. Thyme instead of basil, cumin to bump spice slightly. Breadcrumbs slightly up, cheese cottage down, changing mouthfeel. Baking, then broiling for crisp crust. Quick prep, about half an hour total. Four croquettes, big enough for a light meal. Not just a snack anymore. Serve alongside fresh leafy greens or grilled veg. Great for vegetarians, filling, simple ingredients. No frying necessary."
ingredientsNote: "Ricotta replaces the mild cheese cottage for creaminess and moisture. Smoked mozzarella brings smoky depth, unlike the grassy gruyere. Walnuts instead of almonds bring earthiness and added crunch. Thyme complements the savory notes differently than basil's sweet aroma. Breadcrumbs increased from 75 to 100 ml to offset added moisture from ricotta. Egg remains a binder, but cumin introduces a subtle warmth. Adjust salt carefully since smoked cheese is saltier. Green onions provide fresh sharpness. Modifications aim to transform flavors yet keep croquette structure intact."
instructionsNote: "Start by heating the oven slightly lower than original. Mixing ingredients thoroughly ensures uniform texture but don't overmix to avoid dense croquettes. Forming them evenly helps with consistent cooking. A greased baking sheet aids easy removal. Bake slightly longer for firmer texture, then use broiler to crisp the exterior. Keeping croquettes monitored under broiler prevents burning. Serving recommendations encourage fresh or grilled veggies to balance richness. Prep and cook times are approximate; adjust according to oven variations and desired crunchiness."
tips:
- "Cut ingredients finely. Precision matters. Even pieces ensure even cooking. Heat oven to right temperature. High heat for broiling, low for baking. Check seasoning. Finding balance is crucial. Adjust salt especially with smoked cheese. Flavor varies. Don't skip resting before serving. Let croquettes settle to maintain shape."
- "Greased baking sheet is essential. Don't stick. Easy transfer is key. Try using parchment paper for easier cleanup. Croquettes can be shaped ahead. Store in fridge for up to 2 hours. Bake fresh before serving for best taste. Broiling adds a crunchy finish. Watch closely to avoid burning."
- "Experiment with herbs. Different herbs change flavor profile. Oregano or rosemary can work well. Toast walnuts beforehand. Adds depth of flavor, enhances crunch. Consider serving with sauce. Garlic aioli or spicy mayo can complement. Don't forget presentation; garnish with parsley for color. Simple tweaks create unique experiences."
- "Adjust cooking time. Ovens vary in temperature and efficiency. Always check doneness with a fork. Firmness indicates readiness, but golden color is key. Broil until just right. Be vigilant. Alternative cheeses add their own flavors. Try pepper jack for heat. Variety keeps dishes interesting. Switch veggie sides each season."
