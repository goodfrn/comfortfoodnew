ingredients:
- "3 medium fresh artichokes trimmed"
- "1 lemon juiced"
- "2 garlic cloves minced"
- "50 ml olive oil"
- "60 ml dry white wine"
- "80 ml chicken broth"
- "6 large eggs"
- "50 g goat cheese crumbled"
- "2.5 ml dried thyme"
- "salt and black pepper"
- "15 g unsalted butter"
instructions:
- "Start by cleaning artichokes removing tough leaves and trimming stems. Halve lengthwise, scrape out fuzzy choke. Thinly slice. Toss immediately with lemon juice to avoid browning."
- "Heat 30 ml olive oil over medium heat in saucepan. Add garlic and artichokes. Cook stirring occasionally for 3 minutes."
- "Pour in white wine and chicken broth. Simmer uncovered on medium-low until liquid is nearly evaporated, about 20 minutes. Artichokes should be tender, intensely flavored."
- "While cooking, preheat oven to 175°C (350°F)."
- "Whisk eggs with crumbled goat cheese, thyme, salt, and pepper until just combined."
- "Add cooked artichokes to egg mixture, fold gently."
- "Heat butter and remaining 20 ml olive oil in 9-inch nonstick skillet on medium-high. Pour egg-artichoke mix in. Stir briskly for 4 minutes to partially set edges and distribute artichokes."
- "Transfer skillet to oven. Bake 10 minutes, or until frittata is fully set but still moist in center."
- "Remove, let cool briefly. Slice into wedges. Serve warm with a leafy salad, toasted nuts optional."
introduction: "Eggs with artichokes. Not the usual combo you find everywhere. Artichokes have a rough exterior but soft heart. That heart bursts with flavor when cooked slowly. White wine, broth reduce into a rich syrup that clings to every slice. The lemon keeps things bright so bitterness never creeps in. Goat cheese adds tang once parmesan is out. Thyme replaces oregano — more herby, less sharp. Searing the egg mixture on stove briefly thickens edges and traps air before oven finishes cooking. Butter and oil give needed fat and mouthfeel. Four servings. Make it night, brunch, or lunch. A plate that’s light but filling. Salad on side, toast maybe."
ingredientsNote: "Choosing fresh artichokes matters. Small to medium sized with tightly closed leaves are freshest. Don't skip trimming the choke or it'll annoy. Lemon juice after cutting is essential to keep color. Garlic is minced fine for even flavor distribution. Replace parmesan with soft goat cheese for creaminess without lactose. Dried thyme instead of oregano for earthier notes. Olive oil best quality you have, also butter for richness mixed with oil to prevent burning. White wine should be dry, avoid sweet variants. Chicken broth adds umami depth, vegetable broth works if preferred. Salt and pepper adjusted to taste. Overall ingredients are Mediterranean staples but twisted slightly for different scent and taste profiles."
instructionsNote: "Start prepping artichokes first because takes effort. Trim, halve, scrape center, slice thin. Toss lemon juice fast. Cooking artichokes with garlic on medium heats sugars until softened but not brown. Adding wine then broth creates a simmering bath that reduces slowly — longer than usual to concentrate flavors. Preheating oven needed so transition smooth. Whisk eggs with goat cheese lumpy or smooth, both fine. Thyme mixed in replaces oregano, so fold gently. The stove step after pouring eggs in skillet is slightly longer than standard to develop texture, keep stirring to prevent sticking but keep eggs airy. Transfer to oven in same pan finishes cooking while keeping shape. Bake a bit longer for center to firm but avoid dryness. Rest frittata out of oven so pieces slice clean. Serve with leafy salad. Optional nuts add crunch on side, not inside frittata this time."
tips:
- "Trim artichokes right. Remove tough leaves before halving. Scrape choke fully or bites get fibrous and bitter. Slice thin fast then lemon juice after slicing stops browning. Freshness key. Use small to medium size for best texture. Big artichokes tend tough inside."
- "Simmer artichokes slowly with wine and broth. Low heat, uncovered. Avoid quick boil or liquid disappears too fast. 20 minutes gives tender hearts, flavor concentrates without drying out. Stir occasionally, scrape bottom in case of sticking. Keep heat medium-low consistently."
- "Butter and olive oil together for cooking egg mix. Butter adds richness, oil prevents burning. Heat skillet medium-high before adding eggs. Stir briskly after pouring to partially set edges and keep air pockets. Don’t walk away here, eggs start setting fast but need gentle motion."
- "Eggs whisked with goat cheese crumbled, salt, pepper, thyme. Goat cheese replaces parmesan, gives creaminess, mild tang without lactose issues. Thyme swaps oregano - earthier, less sharp. Fold artichokes gently to avoid breaking slices, preserve texture in final dish."
- "Oven bake finish: 175°C for 10 minutes or until set but still moist center. Don’t overbake or frittata dries out. Remove, cool briefly before slicing to hold shape. Serve with leafy salad for freshness, toasted nuts optional side crunch but excluded inside this time. Keeps dish simple."
faq:
- "q: How to keep artichokes from browning? a: Lemon juice right after slicing, toss quickly and evenly. Keeps color fresh. Work fast. Air exposure darkens cut edges."
- "q: Can I use vegetable broth instead of chicken? a: Yes, good umami too. Maybe a bit lighter taste. Adjust salt. Avoid sweet broth versions. White wine dry, avoid sweet versions as well."
- "q: What if frittata is too dry? a: Could be overbaked or too much simmer liquid lost. Watch oven time strictly. Removing early keeps moist center. Fat from butter and oil helps mouthfeel too."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Wrap tightly, keep refrigerated up to 2 days. Reheat gentle in oven or microwave. Freezing possible but texture changes. Best day of making fresh."
