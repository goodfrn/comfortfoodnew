description: "Chunks of white chocolate and sweetened condensed milk melt into creamy fudge studded with crushed cookies. Slightly altered recipe with milk chocolate swapped for white, two-thirds cookies inside, rest scattered on top. Salt balances sweetness. Chill times adjusted to allow setting without overhardening. Visual and tactile cues emphasized over clocks. Simple, approachable technique but with tips to dodge common problems like grainy texture or burning. A casual, no-fuss treat. Portion control—cutting into 24 squares. Uses 8×8 pan lined with foil or parchment."

ingredients:
- "2 cups white chocolate chips"
- "1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk"
- "2 cups crushed Oreo cookie chunks"
- "Half teaspoon flaky sea salt"
- "Half cup additional crushed Oreo cookies for topping"
instructions:
- "Prep foil or parchment-lined 8×8 pan first; folds easy to lift fudge out later. Avoids stuck edges hell."
- "Medium saucepan; low heat, melt white chocolate and condensed milk together. Stir slowly—steady rhythm, no rush. Chocolate should gloss and swirl into uniform shiny pool. Avoid boiling; no scorched, grainy fudge."
- "Off heat, fold in 2 cups cookie chunks and salt. Salt quiets sickly sweet, adds depth. Fold not stir. Breaks up large clumps, keeps texture."
- "Spoon fudge into pan; spread with rubber spatula or back of spoon. Not too thin; want bite but still creamy. Press lightly to level."
- "Sprinkle remaining cookies evenly on top; press gently. This keeps crunchy bites front and center, shows contrast. Don't press too hard or cookies sink."
- "Leave on counter until cool enough to firm, about 1 hour depending on room temp. Check by touch; fudge feels set but still soft."
- "Slide pan into fridge at least 2 hours or until fully firm and slice-ready. Cold fudge cuts clean; warm fudge smushes."
- "Use sharp knife dipped in hot water then wiped dry to slice squares easily. Wipe blade between cuts to avoid ragged edges."
introduction: "White chocolate fudge. Creamy richness with that hint of cookie crunch throwing a sharp textural curveball. Always struggled melting white chocolate without a butterfat break—patience is key, low heat or bain-marie. Learned folding cookies gently keeps chunks intact; no heavy handed stirring smashing Oreos to dust. Salt? Not just a flavor enhancer; tames super sweet condensed milk and smooths harsh edges. Let fudge cool a bit on counter before fridge. Rushing cooling makes sugar crystals form—grainy mess. Watch the fudge surface for a dull sheen to know when it’s ready to refrigerate. This version swaps milk chocolate for white for a milder creaminess; Oreo chunks as a star ingredient inside plus a crunchy top helps avoid the typical fudge flatness. Sharp knife and warmed blade method essential to clean cuts, or else fudge crumbles like bad luck."
ingredientsNote: "White chocolate chips necessary for creamy melt and mild buttery profile. Substitute with good quality milk or semi-sweet chips if preferred but expect flavor shift. Sweetened condensed milk here acts as both sweetener and binder; avoid evaporated milk or powder substitutes—they won’t set. For cookies, classic sandwich cookies half crushed inside, half sprinkled topside to deliver texture variances—don’t overdo crushing or you end with cookie dust. Salt is critical, preferably flaky sea salt for immediate bursts of contrast; kosher salt or fine salt is fine but adjust quantity as they vary in intensity. Line pan meticulously to prevent sticking; foil plus parchment combo prevents condensation from getting under and messing with texture. Keep measuring rough, no need for precise pinches or scoops—trust the texture and not baking police precision."
instructionsNote: "Heat your pan low and slow. I’ve ruined batches on high heat rushing melting. Chocolate seizes or burnt edges lurk unnoticed if distracted. Watch for glossy sheen and smooth blends; if grains or lumps - keep stirring gently to salvage. Folding cookie pieces preserves crunch; if overworked cookies breakdown, resulting in a paste-hard-to-enjoy. Spread fudge in pan thick enough for satisfying bites; too thin means dry ends. Cookies on top add visual punch and crunch but gently pressing stops them sinking in and losing effect. Cooling: fudge must transform from warm pliable to cool solid state—test firmness by touch, not only time. Overchilling creates rock hard that destroys knife and crackles teeth. Use hot knife tip wiped dry slices smooth squares, prevents stickyness or crumb trails. Patience makes all difference. Enjoy watching the fudge morph from melted chaos to solid gooey creaminess ready to devour."
tips:
- "Low and slow heat on melting prevents grainy mess. White chocolate breaks easily if rushed or scorched. Watch for gloss and swirl; sheen signals readiness to fold cookies in without lumps or overheating. Constant stirring kills texture."
- "Fold Oreo chunks gently off heat after melting mix ready. No stirring or smashing. Keeps chunks intact and noticeable crunch later. Salt sprinkled now does more than flavor; quiets super sweet condensed milk, balances layers. Half crushed inside, rest on top; texture contrast wins."
- "Line pan with foil plus parchment combination to avoid sticking from condensation. Avoids fudge tearing or uneven bottoms. Foil folds make lifting fudge out easier than bare pan edges—critical to cut clean without sticking or mess."
- "Cool fudge at room temperature first, touch test key. Should feel set but soft, not warm or hot when hitting fridge. Too-hot fudge causes sugar crystallization and grainy texture; too-cold leads to rock-hard, dull bites. Watch surface for dull sheen before refrigeration."
- "Knife method: dip blade in hot water, wipe dry between cuts. Prevents fudge sticking to blade and ragged edges. Sharp knife essential; dull edges crush fudge into crumbs, ruins squares. Keep blade warm and dry for clean snap slices."
faq:
- "q: Why fold cookies instead of stirring? a: Folding keeps chunks. Stirring breaks pieces, makes paste. Texture matters, chunks give crunch. Folding also spreads cookies evenly. No smashing Oreo dust here."
- "q: Can I substitute milk chocolate for white? a: Milk chocolate changes flavor profile. Use good quality chips to avoid waxy or gritty result. Melting characteristics differ; watch heat carefully. Sweetness less intense, salt balance shifts."
- "q: What if fudge gets grainy? a: Usually heat too high or sugar crystallizes. Melt low, slow. Stir gently until smooth. Cooling too fast or over stirring after cooling triggers graininess. Reset by reheating gently or adding cream if salvage needed."
- "q: How long to store fudge? a: Refrigerate tightly covered weeks safe. Room temp a few days only, humidity risks. Freeze wrapped well; thaw in fridge for texture. Avoid moisture exposure; fudge absorbs odors, becomes sticky if uncovered."
