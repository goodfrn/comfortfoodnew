ingredients:
- "12 ounces penne pasta"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 tablespoon unsalted butter"
- "1 pound boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces"
- "1.5 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, divided"
- "Salt and freshly ground black pepper"
- "1 medium yellow onion, diced"
- "1 cup canned diced tomatoes"
- "3/4 cup low sodium chicken broth"
- "1 cup reserved pasta water"
- "3/4 cup heavy cream"
- "3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese"
- "Chopped fresh parsley for garnish"
instructions:
- "Bring large pot salted water to boil. Cook penne according to package but shave 2 minutes off recommended time; al dente - firm to bite, with just a hint of chew. Scoop out 1 cup pasta water before draining. Rinse pasta quickly under warm water to stop cooking and remove excess starch, sets texture and prevents sticking. Set aside drained pasta."
- "Heat olive oil and butter in large skillet over medium heat until sizzling and butter foams, signaling ready pan. Add diced chicken tossed in 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning plus salt and pepper. Sear in one layer without crowding, no stirring for 3-4 minutes until golden crust forms. Then flip, cook more until browned all sides, another 3 minutes max. Use slotted spoon to remove and rest chicken; juices locked inside, caramelized bits stuck on pan remain for flavor."
- "Add diced onions to pan and sauté on medium-low heat. Listen for gentle sizzle, smell the onion’s sweet aroma as it softens and turns translucent, about 4-5 minutes. Don’t rush or they burn bitter. Stir occasionally but leave space to give some color."
- "Pour in canned diced tomatoes with juices, chicken broth, and reserved pasta water. Sound should change to a gentle simmer with bubbles rising steadily. Scrape bottom of the pan with wooden spoon to lift browned bits left behind — flavor gold. Let sauce reduce and thicken over medium heat roughly 7-9 minutes; look for sauce to coat spoon lightly. Sauce should cling but not dry out."
- "Turn heat to medium-low. Stir in heavy cream, remaining 1/2 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, and Parmesan cheese. Cheese melts into creamy, luscious sauce with slight grain from cheese melting. Keep stirring gently until sauce is thick and silky, about 2-3 minutes. If sauce too thick, add splash more pasta water. Season taste; adjust salt and more Cajun if need more punch."
- "Return chicken and drained penne pasta to skillet. Toss gently but thoroughly; pasta should be glistening and coated but not swimming. Texture contrast: tender noodles with creamy, spicy sauce; chicken pockets bring concentrated smoky heat."
- "Finish with chopped fresh parsley and sprinkle more Parmesan on top. Serve immediately while warm. The parsley adds bright herbaceous note to balance richness. Keeps well but best fresh."
- "Substitution notes: If no chicken thighs, chicken breast works but takes less time, watch doneness to avoid dryness. Heavy cream can be swapped with half-and-half for lighter version but sauce won’t coat as thickly. Use smoked paprika instead of Cajun for milder smoky flavor. Can replace penne with rigatoni or fusilli for different texture retention."
introduction: "Ever had that itch for pasta with a kick? Something creamy but fiery, not cloying but bold. I’ve danced around the perfect balance for a while. Cajun seasoning throws that spicy curveball against tender chicken, browned to tease out deep flavor. Pasta cooked just so, not mush but with bite, soaked briefly in cold water to kill the extra starch and stop overcooking — a trick learned from a few regrets. Heavy cream folded into simmered tomatoes and broth rounds out the tang and heat, rounding sharp edges with smooth richness. Parmesan melts into this mix, adding umami. Toss it all, toss it well. Each bite hints fiery warmth, creamy silk, cozy comfort. Quick, no fuss, but don’t cheat on those final garnishes; the green parsley and sharp Parm finish it. Not fancy, just honest. Every time I make this, the aroma fills the kitchen — a promising sign. Sounds crackling, bubbling, the faint hiss of sauce thickening, that’s the stage when sauces get personalities."
ingredientsNote: "Penne pasta is sturdy, holds sauce well; swapping with rigatoni or fusilli offers more nooks for sauce to cling. Always save pasta water; starch plus heat works magic to loosen and bind sauces without diluting flavor. Chicken thighs preferred for moisture and flavor but breasts okay if careful not to dry them. Cajun seasoning can vary a lot in heat levels. Start with less, taste the sauce before adding more. Freshly grated Parm beats pre-grated for melt and texture. Butter plus olive oil gives a better sear and flavor lift but can use all olive oil if dairy-free. Onions are base aromatics; cooking low and slow lets sugars develop, so don’t rush or burn. Canned tomatoes chosen for consistency and acidity control. Can toss in fresh cherry tomatoes in summer for brightness but sauce may be looser. Heavy cream thickens smoothly but half-and-half or coconut cream tweaks consistency and flavor for dietary needs."
instructionsNote: "Pasta timing is everything — undershoot a bit, texture continues cooking off heat. Rinsing pasta stops cooking and removes excess starch which can gum up sauce. Use olive oil and butter combo; butter browns and flavors, oil raises smoke point. Chicken pieces crowded? They’ll steam, no sear, lose crust — brown in batches if necessary. Don’t skip resting browned chicken; it locks in juices, flavor. Onion slow sweat releases sweetness and softens mouthfeel — sauté medium heat to avoid bitter burnt bits. Deglazing pan with broth and pasta water lifts stuck caramelized bits, boosting sauce depth. Sauce simmer length depends on thickness; should coat spoon but remain saucy, not dry. Parmesan cheese folded last prevents curdling, ensures smooth sauce. Toss chicken and pasta gently — too rough, pasta breaks, chicken loses shape. Final garnish isn’t just decoration — parsley balances richness with fresh acidity and color contrast. Serve immediately for best texture; leftover reheats okay but sauce may thicken, loosen with splash more cream or broth."
tips:
- "Pasta timing is critical - undershoot recommended cook time by 2 minutes. Al dente texture depends on stopping starch release fast; rinsing with warm water after draining locks that little chew in place. Keeps noodles from sticking and gumming up sauce. Don’t skip scooping out pasta water before draining; water’s starch + heat loosens thick sauce without watering down flavor. Save it, always."
- "Sear chicken in a hot pan with olive oil and butter combo. Butter foaming signals pan ready. Avoid crowding the pan or stirring early. You want that golden crust for texture and flavor. Rest chicken off heat - juices stay inside. Don't toss browned bits; they become the backbone flavor in your sauce when you deglaze with broth and pasta water."
- "Onions cook low and slow; medium-low heat. Listen for gentle sizzle, watch for translucency—4 to 5 minutes. Burnt onions add bitterness that’ll ruin sauce harmony. Stir occasionally but give them breathing room to brown slightly. It’s about developing sweetness and soft texture without harsh edges."
- "Simmer sauce gently. Tomatoes, broth, and pasta water bubble steady, not boil wild. Scrape pan bottom as sauce reduces to lift caramelized bits stuck there. Let sauce coat a spoon lightly; thick enough for cling but don’t let dry out. Adding cream last prevents curdling; fold in cheese slow to melt evenly and keep silky mouthfeel."
- "Final toss of chicken and pasta needs gentleness. Pasta should glisten with sauce, not swimming in it. Too much stirring breaks noodles or chicken pieces. Parsley at end adds fresh, herbaceous zip to cut richness. Parmesan sprinkles on top sharpen flavor contrast. Serve while hot; leftovers reheat but sauce thickens—loosen with a splash of broth or cream."
faq:
- "q: Can I use chicken breast instead of thighs? a: Yes but watch doneness closely. Breasts cook faster and dry out easier. Slice evenly, sear quickly. Resting crucial to keep moist. If thicker cuts use gentle heat after sear, avoid toughness."
- "q: What if I don’t have Cajun seasoning? a: Use smoked paprika mixed with garlic powder and cayenne to mimic smoky heat. Adjust spice levels cautiously, taste sauce before final additions. Adds milder flavor but similar profiles. Alternatives include creole seasoning or chipotle powder for variation."
- "q: Sauce too thick or thin? a: Too thick, add reserved pasta water little by little; starch helps loosen. Too thin, simmer longer uncovered to reduce. Stir often to avoid burning on bottom. Cream can also thicken gently when added gradually but don’t boil vigorously to prevent curdling."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep in airtight container, fridge up to 3 days. Reheat gently on stove low heat. Add splash broth or cream if dry. Can freeze but texture changes some; pasta may absorb sauce, rehydrate with liquid. Avoid microwave blasts to preserve creaminess."
