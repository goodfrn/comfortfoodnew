ingredients:
- "1 pound ground beef"
- "½ cup diced yellow onion"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "½ teaspoon black pepper"
- "½ teaspoon smoked paprika"
- "2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, divided"
- "3 large eggs"
- "½ cup self-rising flour"
- "½ cup whole milk"
- "½ teaspoon garlic powder"
- "nonstick cooking spray"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven to 410 degrees, hotter oven helps crust firm and cheese bubble."
- "Spray an 8-inch pie pan evenly with nonstick spray. Don't skimp here or crust clings."
- "Heat skillet over medium heat. Toss in ground beef, onion, salt, pepper, smoked paprika. Stir and let beef sizzle till no pink remains, onions turn translucent, juicy smell fills air."
- "Drain any fat carefully. You want beef moist not greasy."
- "Place about half the beef mixture evenly in bottom of pie pan. Press lightly, creates base."
- "Scatter 1 cup cheddar over beef. Make sure cheese layer spreads wide or bites dry out."
- "Add remaining beef on top, level it."
- "Spread last cup of cheddar cheese over beef mound. Notice color contrast, cheese should peek through edges."
- "In medium bowl whisk eggs with flour, milk, garlic powder. Mixture lumps acceptable—don't overmix or pie toughness follows."
- "Gently pour batter over layered beef and cheese, move pan slightly to distribute evenly."
- "Bake pie in oven on middle rack about 28-30 minutes. Look for bubbling cheese edges and firm center when poked with knife."
- "Let rest 5-7 minutes after removing. Slices hold better, cheese settles, crust crisps."
- "Slice into six pieces. Expect hearty, savory layers with smoky kick; texture contrast between chewy crust and creamy cheese is key."
introduction: "Ever had a cheeseburger in pie form? Took a stab at that classic combo and learned a few things the hard way. Ground beef needs seasoning beyond just salt and pepper, paprika adds a smoky punch not found in the original. Using self-rising flour instead of Bisquick cuts crumbs and fuss. The layering is where magic unfolds; cheese pockets melt and create juicy bursts surrounded by meat. Baking hotter and a bit longer than some say yields a crust that holds the gooey mix without sogginess, edges caramelize with cheese crisping visibly. Let rest before slicing — patience pays off when your pie stays intact instead of a sloppy mess. It’s more than throwing ingredients together, noticing those bubbles and textures matters. Tried and tweaked over time, final version screams bold flavor and satisfying, comforting texture contrast."
ingredientsNote: "Ground beef around 80/20 fat ratio works best—leads to juicy filling. Leaner beef dries out quicker unless you add a splash of broth or oil. Yellow onions bring mild sweetness, but a diced shallot or scallion gives subtle sharpness if onions overpower your kitchen. I swapped Bisquick with self-rising flour; it still traps air, bakes soft, but less processed. Garlic powder over garlic salt here—easier control over intensity when layering. Sharp cheddar’s key—avoid mild cheeses or they’ll disappear in baking, fat content should be at least 30%. If stuck, shredded mozzarella can add melty pull, but cheese flavor diminishes. Nonstick spray mandatory to prevent crust-stick scenarios. Milk should be whole fat; skim makes pie dry and crumbly. Simple pantry items, no fancy stuff needed."
instructionsNote: "Starting heat medium, listening for sizzling beef and smelling onions going translucent—skip that and you lose moisture and flavor depth. Drain fat completely to avoid soggy pie base but leave a little for richness inside crust. Layering is methodical; pack ground beef tight but not compacted, sprinkle cheese evenly to ensure every slice gets melty cheese layers. Pour batter slowly; too much agitation defeats the airy quality needed. Oven temperature dial matters—too low means soggy crust, too high burns edges. I prefer visual cues: bubbling cheese edges mean it’s done baking, knife inserted should come out clean, no wet batter. Resting locks structure; try slicing too soon and you lose precious gooey balance turned dry mess. Save leftovers wrapped tight in fridge, reheat in oven to maintain crust crispness."
tips:
- "Heat medium start. Hear beef sizzle, onions turn translucent. Stop before drying out. Drain fat but leave a little for flavor and crust richness. Over-drain and pie gets dry. Press beef in pan but not compacted; air pockets help layers. Cheese layers must be even, or some bites dry out. Pour batter slow so it doesn’t get tough. Lumps in mix are fine, don’t overwhisk. Visual cues matter—bubbling edges, cheese browning, crust firmness. Rest pie five to seven minutes before slicing. Resting seals structure, stops cheese leaking, crust crisps."
- "Swap Bisquick with self-rising flour for less processed taste. It traps air differently—bakes softer but still light. Milk needs to be whole fat; skim dries pie and makes crumbly crust. Smoky paprika adds depth missing with just salt and pepper. Can toss in garlic powder over garlic salt; control flavor better. Sharp cheddar with at least 30% fat needed; mild cheeses disappear in heat. Mozzarella can add meltiness but dulls flavor balance. Nonstick spray mandatory; otherwise crust sticks to pan and tears."
- "Baking hotter at 410 degrees helps crust firm fast, cheese bubbles visibly on edges. Too low temp means soggy crust; too high burns edges quick. Best cue is knife test—comes out clean without wet batter. Timing around 28-30 minutes depends on your oven. Crust should look caramelized and cheese crisp around edges. Pour batter evenly moving pan gently but no stirring. Batter lumps okay; overmixing develops gluten causing toughness. Let slices rest after baking; cutting too soon causes pie to fall apart, gooey cheese leaks out."
- "Season beef thoroughly before cooking, beyond just salt pepper. Paprika lifts umami, gives smoky notes. Onions bring sweetness; can swap with shallots or scallions if onions overpower air. Drain fat carefully—not all, some fat keeps filling juicy. Layers go beef, cheese, beef, cheese to trap melts inside. Pressing beef base creates crust foundation. Cheese layers must be wide, don’t pile in center only or edges dry. Pour batter slow to trap air; if poured rough, pie texture turns dense and dry."
- "Leftovers store wrapped tight in fridge to avoid soggy crust. Reheat in oven rather than microwave to bring back crust crispness. Don’t slice pie too early; allows cheese pockets to settle. Biscuit batter lumps don’t impact bake quality if mixed right amount. Use nonstick spray on pan even if you think crust won’t stick. Baking on middle rack balances heat flow and crust bake. Smell changes cue doneness—juicy meat aroma, cheese bubbling, crust crisping, slight caramel smell at edges."
faq:
- "q: Can I use regular flour instead of self-rising? a: Regular flour alone won’t rise. Need baking powder salt added. Otherwise pie dense, no lift in batter. Alternatives like Bisquick work fine but more processed. Measured baking powder fixes it. Skip if texture tough."
- "q: What if my cheese melts away in pie? a: Use sharp cheddar at least 30% fat. Mild blends melt and disappear, losing flavor pockets. Mozzarella adds gooey pull but dilutes taste. Spread cheese evenly over beef layers so some bites have melted pockets."
- "q: How to tell when pie is done baking? a: Look for bubbling cheese edges, crust turning caramel color. Knife inserted comes out clean, no wet batter. Smell sharp: savory beef aroma, cheese crisping smell noticeable. Avoid overbaking or underbaking to keep juicy texture."
- "q: How should leftovers be stored and reheated? a: Wrap tight in fridge—keep crust dry. Microwave sogginess kills crispness, oven reheats better at moderate temp until edges firm up again. Fridge for 3-4 days max. Freeze possible but texture changes slightly."
