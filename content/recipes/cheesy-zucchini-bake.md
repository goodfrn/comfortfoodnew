ingredients:
- "3 medium yellow squash thinly sliced"
- "1 medium sweet onion thinly sliced"
- "2 tablespoons olive oil"
- "1 large egg"
- "3/4 cup whole milk"
- "3 tablespoons melted unsalted butter"
- "1/3 cup sour cream"
- "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt"
- "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper"
- "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder"
- "1 cup sharp cheddar cheese shredded, divided"
- "1 cup buttery cracker crumbs"
- "1 teaspoon dried parsley"
instructions:
- "Preheat oven 350°F. Spray 3-quart casserole with oil, set aside."
- "Heat olive oil in large heavy skillet over medium-high until shimmering but not smoking."
- "Add sliced squash and onion in two batches. Cook each batch till edges wrinkle slightly and release faint sizzling moisture, about 4-6 minutes per batch. Don't let soften to mush, subtle snap remains."
- "Drain squash-onion mix aggressively in colander. Press with spatula to wring excess water or use paper towels to pat dry. Transfer to large bowl."
- "In small bowl whisk egg, milk, melted butter, sour cream, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and 1/2 cup cheddar thoroughly till mixture loosens and creamy."
- "Fold wet mixture gently into warm squash-onion mix. Avoid overmixing lest squash break down further; keep chunks intact."
- "Pour all into casserole dish. Level top with spatula but not compressed."
- "Sprinkle crushed crackers evenly, top with remaining 1/2 cup cheddar and dried parsley."
- "Bake uncovered 20-25 minutes or until cheese bubbles vigorously and cracker topping colors golden brown with toasty hints."
- "Remove from oven. Let rest 7-10 minutes so juices settle and casserole firms. Serve warm."
introduction: "Yellow squash sliced thin, onion joined in the heat. Tossed in olive oil till they're softening but hold their shape. Moisture gets squeezed out—crucial, trust me. Creamy mixture of egg, melted butter, sour cream, and sharp cheddar pulls everything together. Baking makes squash tender without slipping into soggy mush. Top crowned with buttery cracker crumbs, extra cheddar for that browning. Crisp, bubbly, with garlic aroma riding high. You’ll want to skip the usual soggy casseroles. Timing is a rough guide; watch the color and bubbles. Tried it with goat cheese once—added a nice tang but lost some crisp. This one’s more classic but always welcome on the table."
ingredientsNote: "Yellow squash is forgiving but watery—drain drainage no less than 5 minutes vital to avoid watery messes. Olive oil is best for flavor and high smoke point; vegetable oil works but less flavor. Cheddar can be swapped for sharp white cheddar, gouda or even pepper jack if you want heat. Sour cream balances richness; Greek yogurt is a fair substitute but impacts moisture slightly. Crackers for topping must be buttery or they’ll crisp hard but lack flavor—panko crumbs aren’t the same. Salt measured carefully because cheese adds salt already. Fresh garlic powder always better than dried for aroma punch; skip if fresh garlic is on hand but cook briefly in oil first to soften bite. Butter melted warm but not browned prevents harsh caramel flavors."
instructionsNote: "Don’t rush cooking squash. Hear the sizzle drop off and edges curling means perfect doneness. Overcooked squash turns to glue on baking. Drain thoroughly or casserole will be swampy. Gentle folding with wet egg-cheese mix keeps texture but ensures flavor penetration. Avoid vigorous stirring. Use quality casserole dish for even heat distribution; metal heats fastest, ceramic holds heat longer. Top layering of crackers and cheese critical for crisp topping—press lightly so crackers stay dry for better browning. Oven temp steady at 350°F; too hot burns topping before filling cooks. Resting after baking is non-negotiable for texture to set. Serve warm, not hot—cheese firms slightly and casseroles slice clean."
tips:
- "Drain squash-onion mix aggressively after cooking. Use spatula pressure or paper towels to remove excess water. Moisture kills crispness. No shortcuts here. Five minutes minimum or top wilts, soggy mess guaranteed."
- "Fold egg-cheese mix gently into warm veggies. Avoid overmixing. Too much stirring breaks squash chunks, makes mush. Keep textures distinct. Look for creamy coating, not sloppy liquid pooling. Sensitive balance."
- "Choose oil with high smoke point; olive oil preferred for flavor. Vegetable oil can replace but loses aroma. Heat until shimmer, don’t smoke to avoid bitter notes. Sizzle sound fades when squash edges curl—signal to drain immediately."
- "Use buttery cracker crumbs for topping. Panko dries out too fast, no flavor. Layer cracker then cheese evenly, press lightly—not packed. Topping browns best when loose, dry. Oven temp steady 350°F. Too hot burns crackers before inside cooks."
- "After baking, rest casserole on counter 7-10 minutes. Juices settle, structure firms up. Slice warms easily and holds shape better. Serve room-warm, not hot, for cleaner cuts and balanced texture. Skip rest; edges collapse, sloppy slices."
faq:
- "q: How to avoid mushy squash? a: Drain immediately after sauté. Squash releases water fast; squeeze with spatula or paper towel. Cook till edges wrinkle, sizzle fades. Don’t rush draining, or bake soggy mess. Could use thicker slices less water but lose tender bite."
- "q: Can cheese be swapped? a: Yes, try sharp white cheddar, gouda, or pepper jack for heat. Goat cheese adds tang but melts differently. Adjust salt accordingly since cheeses differ in saltiness. Greek yogurt works for sour cream but watch moisture - might need longer draining."
- "q: Why won’t topping crisp? a: Usually moisture. Drain squash well before mixing. Crackers must be buttery crumbs, not panko or dry crumbs. Oven temp should be right—too low, no browning. Spread topping loosely, avoid pressing hard or it steams instead of crisps."
- "q: How store leftovers? a: Cool fully then cover airtight, fridge up to 3 days. Reheat in oven 350°F to restore topping crunch, not microwave unless in hurry—will lose crisp. Freezing not recommended; texture suffers, topping becomes mushy when reheated."
