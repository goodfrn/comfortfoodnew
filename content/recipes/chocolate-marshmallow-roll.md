ingredients:
- "1 cup all-purpose flour"
- "1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "4 large eggs"
- "3/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1/4 cup vegetable oil (can substitute melted coconut oil but watch flavor)"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract (or clear vanilla if you want no color)"
- "powdered sugar for dusting"
- "1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature"
- "1 tsp clear vanilla flavoring"
- "7 ounces marshmallow fluff (substitute with homemade marshmallow cream if needed)"
- "3 cups powdered sugar"
- "4 tbsp half and half (adjust for desired buttercream consistency)"
- "1/2 cup mini marshmallows (plus extra for garnish)"
- "chocolate syrup for drizzling"
- "nonstick spray for pan"
- "parchment paper to line pan"
instructions:
- "=== Chocolate Sponge Cake ==="
- "Preheat oven to around 345°F for more even heat; line a 10x15x1 jelly roll pan. Parchment paper is vital for peeling later, spray lightly over it."
- "In a bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, salt. Whisk to mix evenly—lumps ruin the crumb."
- "In a large bowl, beat eggs, sugar, oil, and vanilla on high for 5-6 minutes. Look for thick, frothy, pale yellow. If skipped, batter won’t hold air."
- "Gently fold flour mixture into eggs. Use a spatula, fold slowly but thoroughly—don't deflate the batter. Keep air bubbles alive."
- "Pour batter evenly into the pan. Use offset spatula for smoothness; important so cake bakes uniformly. Tap pan once on counter to release trapped air."
- "Bake ~11-13 minutes. Watch the edges—they pull slightly from pan when done, top looks set with no jiggle. Overbaking dries sponge out fast."
- "Remove from oven. Run a knife around edges to loosen the cake immediately."
- "Dust a clean kitchen towel liberally with powdered sugar—don’t skimp. This stops sticking when rolling."
- "Place the sugar-dusted towel face down on cake immediately. The warmth helps sugar stick to pan and sponge without tearing."
- "Cover with a large cutting board or flat sheet pan. Use oven mitts. Quickly flip the whole setup so cake rests on towel, pan upside down on the board."
- "Slowly peel parchment paper off the cake. If it sticks, ease with a little steam or gentle tug but be gentle to avoid tears."
- "Dust top of cake with more powdered sugar to keep surface dry and ready for rolling."
- "With short end of towel, begin rolling the cake up gently but firmly. Roll while warm helps avoid cracks. Set aside to cool completely rolled."
- "=== Marshmallow Buttercream ==="
- "Beat softened butter and clear vanilla on medium-high for about 1-1.5 mins till creamy. Scrape bowl sides."
- "Add marshmallow fluff, beat 1 min more until fully combined. Texture thick and sticky."
- "Slowly add powdered sugar in ½ cup increments, alternate with half and half. Lower speed when adding sugar—avoid powder cloud. Adjust half and half to get spreadable but not runny consistency."
- "=== Assembly ==="
- "Unroll the cooled cake slowly; some cracks are normal, don't fret."
- "Spread buttercream evenly over cake using offset spatula, avoid edges to prevent filling from oozing out."
- "Scatter mini marshmallows evenly on the filling. They melt slightly into filling later, giving patches of gooey sweetness."
- "Re-roll cake gently but firmly to maintain shape. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap."
- "Chill at least 4-6 hours, preferably overnight. Chilling firms up buttercream, makes slicing neat."
- "Before serving, drizzle chocolate syrup over the top and sprinkle extra mini marshmallows for decoration and texture contrast."
- "Slice into ten ~½-inch pieces. Use serrated knife for clean cuts."
introduction: "Hot chocolate cake plus marshmallow frosting rolled tight—trick is in timing and texture. Don’t rush the mixing. Frothy eggs trap air; they’re the backbone. Cocoa and baking powder balance structure and flavor. Rolling technique makes or breaks the look—dust your towel well or face tears. Filling has sticky weight; vanilla and fluff bring that sweet buoyancy. Cooling keeps the roll intact—cut too soon, it all falls apart. Grab a serrated knife, slice with care. Tried skipping parchment once—disaster. Tried room temp butter too cold, lumpy mess. Now? Patience and handling rule. Every cook has that failed batch story. You’ll see spots of marshmallow peek through once sliced—bonus gooey surprise."
ingredientsNote: "Flour can be swapped for cake flour to lighten texture but reduce slightly (a Tbsp less). Cocoa powder must be unsweetened; natural or Dutch process both work but note color difference. Baking powder adds lift but can be halved if using self-rising flour. Oil keeps crumb moist—vegetable works best neutral; coconut adds aroma but changes flavor profile. Clear vanilla is key if you want a light colored buttercream; regular vanilla adds flecks. Marshmallow fluff can be swapped for homemade marshmallow cream or white chocolate ganache for a twist. Use half and half or whole milk to adjust buttercream thickness—too thin, it runs, too thick, it's tough to spread. Mini marshmallows add texture, but chopped marshmallows or even crushed fluff candies can be fun alternate toppers."
instructionsNote: "Beating eggs and sugar takes 5-6 minutes to integrate air; rushing here means dense cake. Fold flour in slowly and avoid overmixing—batter should look homogenous but light. Watch the baking time carefully; small variations can dry out the sponge or leave it too wet. Flip with care when placing the towel on cake—do it while warm, or you’ll crack the sponge. Peeling parchment too soon or cold is recipe nemesis. Rolling while warm helps avoid cracks; don’t force it, a few minor cracks won’t sabotage the final roll. Buttercream needs to be well beaten at each step; scrape sides. Add powdered sugar gradually to avoid dust clouds and graininess. Spreading any uneven will cause uneven rolling and cracking issues. Chilling firm is crucial—don’t skip, or slices fall apart. Use gentle even pressure when rolling—no jerks. Plastic wrap is your friend for holding shape and locking in moisture. Wait for full chill before slicing with serrated knife for best results."
tips:
- "Beat eggs and sugar 5-6 mins high speed; look for thick, frothy, pale yellow. Air trapped here holds sponge structure. Skip or rush this step, batter collapses. Use cold eggs. Visual check best indicator; texture like light mousse. If batter looks flat, wait or beat more. No lumps in flour mix. Sift well then fold gently. Avoid deflating all those precious bubbles."
- "Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, salt together. Whisk dry mix fully. No clumps allowed, clumps = dense spots. Cocoa powder must be unsweetened — Dutch processed or natural. Flavor changes slightly. Baking powder can be halved if self-rising flour used. Salt measured exactly. Even distribution needed for lift and taste. Slowly fold dry into wet. Don’t overmix or batter turns tough. Fold like you’re caressing air bubbles."
- "Line pan with parchment plus nonstick spray on top. Spray lightly on paper too. Paper removal tricky if missed. Cake sticks, tears like bad horror flick. Once baked, loosen edges immediately with knife. Helps when you flip cake onto sugared towel. Use well-dusted towel, powdered sugar thick layer. No sugar, cake sticks, rips during roll. Warm cake critical. Roll gently while warm, cracks happen otherwise. Cool rolled; unroll only when cool — cracks become manageable then."
- "Buttercream needs softened butter, not cold lumps. Beat creaminess 1-1.5 mins; use clear vanilla flavor for light color. Add marshmallow fluff slowly, beat till thick, sticky. Powdered sugar in half cup doses alternating with half and half. Avoid dust clouds, reduce speed while adding sugar. Texture should spread but not runny. Too thin = leaks, too thick = hard to spread. Adjust half and half carefully. Scrape bowl edges every step. Even spreading crucial for smooth roll—patchy filling = cracked roll."
- "Chill roll minimum 4 hours to firm filling; overnight better. Cutting warm roll = messy, filling oozes out. Use serrated knife for clean slices. Don’t press hard, gentle sawing motion. Mini marshmallows inside add gooey spots but melt slightly — wait for partial set. Drizzling chocolate syrup right before serving adds shine and pockets of rich flavor. Wrapping tight in plastic prevents drying out during chilling. If leftover, store wrapped in fridge 3 days max or freeze wrapped tight."
faq:
- "q: Can I swap types of flour? a: Cake flour lighter texture; subtract a Tbsp from all-purpose measure. Self-rising flour can replace but reduce baking powder by half or cake gets flat weird texture. Plain flour works but denser crumb. Mixing flours sometimes done if no cake flour. Watch batter consistency, adjust liquids if needed."
- "q: What to do if cake cracks while rolling? a: Usually means cake cooled too much or rolled too tightly. Warm cake rolls smoother. If cracks, roll slowly, don’t force. Cover cracks with buttercream after rolling or patch with extra fluff. Don’t panic if minor cracks. Next time, roll immediately after baking with sugared towel for best flexibility."
- "q: How to fix too runny buttercream? a: Add more powdered sugar gradually until spreadable. Use less half and half or chill bowl to thicken quickly. If too stiff, a splash more half and half or milk can loosen. Overbeating can warm buttercream make it soft. Chill briefly and remix gently if soft. Texture control is trial for each kitchen climate."
- "q: Storing leftovers best method? a: Wrap tightly in plastic or foil. Refrigerate at least 4-6 hours before slicing for firm texture. Can freeze well in airtight wrap for up to one month. Thaw overnight in fridge wrapped to avoid condensation ruining surface. Keeping moisture balance critical to avoid soggy or dry cake. Leftover cake works great as base for parfaits or trifle."
