ingredients:
- "90 g (3/4 cup) quick-cooking oats"
- "100 g (3/4 cup) unbleached all-purpose flour"
- "3 ml (3/4 teaspoon) baking powder"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "100 g (7 tablespoons) softened unsalted butter"
- "100 ml (1/3 cup) honey"
- "1 large egg"
- "120 ml (1/2 cup) raspberry jam"
- "40 g (1/3 cup) almond flour"
instructions:
- "Set oven rack to middle position. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Line 12 muffin cups with paper or silicone liners."
- "In a medium bowl, combine oats, all-purpose flour, almond flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix to combine evenly."
- "In a separate bowl, beat softened butter with honey using mixer until creamy. Add egg and mix until incorporated."
- "Fold dry mixture into wet ingredients just until combined. Divide dough roughly in half."
- "Spoon half the dough equally into the bottom of each muffin cup. Press down and hollow out the centers slightly."
- "Add a tablespoon of raspberry jam into each potato-sized recess. Crumble remaining dough on top to form an uneven, crumbly layer."
- "Bake for about 21 to 22 minutes. Edges should be golden and crisp, centers still soft but set."
- "Remove from oven and allow to cool in pans for 10 minutes. Then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before serving."
introduction: "Oats and jam clash in cups. Muffin shape, but not muffins. Crunch. Sweet tart jam. Honey instead of sugar shifts the vibe, more floral, sticky. Almond flour sneaks in, adds nuttiness without whole nuts. Baking powder used, not soda, different lift and texture. Bake lower, longer, 180 degrees. Watch edges. Soft middles, crumbly tops. Twelve little bites. No nuts but almonds, subtle. Vegetarian, no lactose either if butter swapped with plant base. Keeps pretty well, fridge or cool spot. Jam can be any berry mix. Raspberry chosen for tartness. Fast to whip up, easy to split dough. Messy crumbles. Best with coffee or tea. Good for snack or dessert. Not too sweet, just right balance of textures. Danish vibes. Simple ingredients, easy steps."
ingredientsNote: "The oats chosen are quick-cooking, but not instant, giving a slight chew without being too coarse. Flour is basic unbleached all-purpose, but almond flour adds moisture and softness to the crumb. Swapping brown sugar for honey lowers processed sugar, introduces a floral note that pairs well with fruity jam. Butter softened, not melted—important for creaming. Jam should be thick and seedless if possible, raspberry is tart, but strawberry or blueberry work too. Baking powder instead of baking soda means no acidic balances needed; neutral will lift and tenderize. Quantity changes reduce sugar and butter slightly for a lighter dough. Salt is essential to balance sweetness and bring out oat flavor. All ingredients measured reliably by weight for consistency. Dairy can be made vegan by replacing butter with plant-based spread and egg with flax or chia egg."
instructionsNote: "Preheat precise to 180°C to avoid overbrowning. Lining muffin cups avoids sticking; silicone liners are re-usable, eco-friendly. Mixing oats, flours, salt, powder first prevents lumps. Creaming butter and honey well aerates dough, adding air for lightness. Egg addition slows mixing to avoid overworking dough, keeps tender crumb. Fold dry ingredients gently, resist overmixing; crumbly mixture expected, partly dry before jam addition. Dividing dough halves good for layering jam correctly without mixing. Press bottom half into muffin cups, create small indent center—jam sits without sinking or overflowing. Crumbling top half randomly makes rustic crunchy top. Bake fifteen to twenty-two minutes depends on oven; small time adjustment included. Don’t overbake, want soft center. Cool in pan prevents breakage; transfer only once firm. Serve at room temperature. Stores airtight for up to three days; jam keeps moisture from drying. Optional warming before serving softens jam center again."
tips:
- "Butter should be softened. Don’t melt it. Why? Creaming helps add air. Making dough light, fluffy. Honey binds ingredients, adds sweetness. Together, this makes a perfect base."
- "For the jam, raspberry is great. Tartness balances sweetness. But strawberry or blueberry also work. Seedless preferred. Thickness matters, so it doesn't ooze out. Keeps muffins moist and delicious."
- "Baking time can vary. Every oven is different. Start checking around 20 minutes. Edges should be golden. Centers soft. Overbaking means dry muffins. Watch closely. Don’t rush this part."
- "Cool muffins in the pan. Why? It prevents crumbling. Cooling too fast cracks the tops. Airtight storage keeps muffins fresh. They last up to three days. Jam keeps moisture locked in."
- "Almond flour adds a unique texture. But can swap it out. If avoiding nuts, use more regular flour. Adjust moisture slightly. Quick oats, not instant, for best results. They add chew without being coarse."
faq:
- "q: Can I use different jam? a: Yes, feel free. Just make sure it’s thick. Seedless if possible. Raspberry stands out. Others will work too, sweetness will vary."
- "q: What if I skip the honey? a: Regular sugar is fine but changes flavor. Honey adds floral notes. Refined sugar less moisture, so adjust accordingly. Muffins might be drier."
- "q: How can I make these dairy-free? a: Replace butter with plant spread. Egg can be swapped for flax egg. Mix 1 tablespoon flaxseed with 2.5 tablespoons water. Let it sit for a bit."
- "q: Can I freeze these muffins? a: Yes! Wrap tightly in plastic. Store in freezer. They stay well for up to two months. Thaw at room temperature or warm slightly before enjoying."
