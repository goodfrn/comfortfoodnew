ingredients:
- "525 ml (2 1/4 cups) chicken broth low sodium"
- "525 ml (2 1/4 cups) whole milk"
- "1 large carrot, finely diced"
- "2 stalks celery, finely diced"
- "1 small onion, minced"
- "45 ml (3 tbsp) olive oil"
- "315 g (1 1/2 cups) arborio rice"
- "100 ml (just under 1/2 cup) dry white wine"
- "375 g (about 3/4 lb) shrimp peeled, deveined, chopped"
- "125 g (1 cup) thawed frozen corn kernels"
- "25 ml (1 1/2 tbsp) fresh parsley, chopped"
- "Pinch ground nutmeg"
- "Salt and pepper to taste"
instructions:
- "Heat broth and milk together in small pot. Bring to boil, then remove immediately. Keep warm near stove."
- "Warm oil in large heavy pan over medium heat. Stir in carrot, celery, onion. Cook gently till softened, about 6 minutes."
- "Add rice, stir to coat in oil and veggies. Toast about 90 seconds. Pour in white wine. Let it bubble off until almost dry, about 3 minutes."
- "Begin adding warm broth mixture in ladlefuls (~250 ml), stirring often. Wait until liquid nearly absorbed before adding next ladle. Stir frequently, no rushing."
- "After around 20 minutes, taste rice. Should be creamy but still a bit firm center (al dente)."
- "Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg pinch."
- "Fold in chopped shrimp, corn, and parsley. Continue cooking and stirring for another 3 minutes or until shrimp are pink and cooked through."
- "Remove from heat. Let sit 2 minutes off heat. Adjust seasoning if needed. Serve immediately."
introduction: "Shrimp meets corn and rice in a creamy jumble. No fuss, no fancy tricks. Milk and broth cook together, slow and steady heat draws out starchy richness. Tiny diced carrot and celery lend sweet crunch beneath the creamy. Dry white wine cuts through, drying up fast in the pan. Shrimp go in last, just enough to turn pink, tender but intact. Fresh parsley chopped for a little green brightness. Nutmeg pinch? Optional but there, lurking in the background. Throw it all together for a warm, thick, rice dish with shellfish bite. Rustic, but refined enough for company. Feeds four to six hungry mouths. Timing tight but flexible."
ingredientsNote: "Use low sodium broth so seasoning control stays flexible during cooking. Whole milk preferred for creaminess but skim can work at cost of richness. Dice carrot and celery uniformly so they cook evenly in initial saute. Minced onion softens quickly and blends well—avoid large pieces. Arborio essential for risotto consistency; other rice types won’t absorb or release starch correctly. Dry white wine must be quality pour—cheap vinegar-like bottles will sour flavors. Shrimp peeled and deveined, chopped coarsely or left whole for bite. Frozen corn works fine if thawed, fresh corn if in season preferred for sweetness and texture. Parsley fresh, finely chopped to distribute flavor evenly. Nutmeg optional but adds subtle warmth, don’t overdo or overpower."
instructionsNote: "Keep broth and milk hot but not boiling while adding to rice slowly. Stir often but gently, scraping bottom to avoid sticking. Add ladlefuls only when mostly absorbed, patience key for creamy texture. Toast rice in oil and wine step intensifies flavor before broth infusion. White wine must evaporate mostly—raw alcohol ruins dish. Incorporate shrimp and corn at end, cooking just until shrimp turn opaque for best texture. Nutmeg sprinkled after salt and pepper avoids clumping or bitterness. Let risotto rest briefly after cooking for flavors to meld and final thickening. Serve hot immediately; risotto doesn’t hold well reheated, so timing critical to serve right after completion."
tips:
- "Use low sodium broth—it matters. Helps control seasoning, allows flexibility. Whole milk is best for creaminess. Skim milk? It'll work but cost richness. Dice carrot and celery evenly; they need to cook together. Onion? Minced. Avoid large chunks. Arborio rice is essential. No substitutes. Other rice types won't absorb or release starch properly."
- "Quality dry white wine is crucial. Cheap stuff ruins everything. Alcohol must evaporate almost fully. Remember? Bad wine flavors. Add shrimp and corn at end. Cook just until shrimp is opaque and tender. Timing matters here. Sticking to the pot? Stir often. Scrape bottom with each ladleful."
- "Patience is key for risotto. Stir gently but continuously. Wait until each ladle is mostly absorbed before adding more broth. This isn’t speedy cooking. For texture, letting it rest briefly after cooking allows flavors to meld. Risotto won't hold? Serve immediately for the best experience."
- "Adjust seasoning at the end—salt and pepper are key. Nutmeg can add warmth. Use just a pinch, though. Too much ruins everything. A little fresh parsley gives a nice touch. It's all about balance. Frozen corn is fine but fresh? Always better if in season. Texture and flavor."
- "Looking to bulk it up? Add veggies like peas or spinach. Great blend with shrimp. This dish? Versatile. Doesn’t have to be just shrimp and corn. Explore flavors—add herbs if desired. Stick to some basic rules but experiment. Risks can lead to great discoveries."
faq:
- "q: How can you make it vegetarian? a: Skip shrimp. Add mushrooms if you want umami. Use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Flavor will change. No meat, but still rich and comforting."
- "q: Can I store leftovers? a: Refrigerate in airtight container. Use within 1-2 days. Risotto doesn’t reheat well though. Texture changes, becomes thick. Consider reheating on low heat with extra broth. Helps loosen mixture."
- "q: Common issue with risotto? a: It can end up too dry. If not enough broth added slowly, rice won't cook properly. Should be creamy. Check if still undercooked or just needs more broth."
- "q: Best way to serve it? a: Serve hot, immediately after cooking. Presentation? Simple. Fresh parsley on top looks nice. Parmesan cheese? Sprinkle if you like. Enhances the dish, adds richness."
