instructions:
- "=== Chimichurri Sauce ==="
- "1. Combine parsley, dill, olive oil, white vinegar, maple syrup, and salt in a bowl. Stir vigorously. Season with cracked black pepper."
- "=== Salad ==="
- "2. Heat grill to high. Brush grill grates with oil to prevent sticking."
- "3. Grill corn and carrots for about 12 to 14 minutes, turning occasionally, until caramelized and cooked through. Remove and let cool slightly."
- "4. Cut kernels off the cobs, slice carrots diagonally into thick strips."
- "5. In a large bowl, toss corn kernels, carrot strips, and torn romaine with half the chimichurri sauce. Taste, adjust salt and acidity if needed."

- "7. Serve with remaining chimichurri on the side for extra drizzle."
introduction: "Grill marks on corn, sweetness in smoke. Carrots thick, sliced obliquely, tender yet with bite. Chimichurri changed up—parsley still star, but dill instead of coriander. Maple syrup for subtle sweet instead of honey. White vinegar sharpens. Salad texture varied—crisp romaine, creamy avocado lightly zested with lemon. Optional flowers. Vibrant colors. Oil trimmed down, so less greasy. Toss half the sauce right before serving. Keep the rest for drizzling. Quick to make. Few ingredients. Less than 30 minutes. No dairy, nuts, eggs, or gluten. Bright, earthy all in one bowl. Great side or light lunch. Bring outdoors or keep inside stove side. Smoky, fresh, simple."
ingredientsNote: "Flat-leaf parsley traditional but dill changes aromatic profile, lends fresh grassy note. Swap coriander leaves for dill for variation. Maple syrup works well instead of honey for sweetness, also vegan. White vinegar replaces apple cider vinegar for sharper acidity. Oil quantity slightly reduced from original for lighter dressing. Corn and carrot weights adjusted smaller for proportionate servings. Edible flowers purely decorative but add texture and subtle flavors if wanted, not mandatory. Avocado cut thin for creaminess, with lemon juice preventing browning. Use small young carrots for tenderness. Grill corn whole, then remove kernels later. Simple, fresh pantry staples seducing."
instructionsNote: "Chimichurri made first, mixing herbs with oil and acid then sweetener, salt. Pepper added fresh later to not overwhelm herbaceousness. Grill preparation critical—high heat and oiled grates prevent sticking and encourage charred flavor. Rotate veggies frequently for even caramelization, avoid burning. Cooling before shelling corn and slicing carrots avoids loss of juice and burning fingers. Toss veggies warm but not hot with half sauce to marry flavors without wilting lettuce. Save rest of chimichurri for last-minute brightness. Plating with avocado last maintains shape and prevents mush. Edible flowers sprinkled carefully. Serve immediately to prevent lettuce sogginess. Timing adjusted ±5% for balance of tenderness and char."
tips:
- "Mix chimichurri first. Fresh herbs matter, parsley, and dill. Combine those with oil and vinegar. Then add maple syrup for sweet taste. Salt helps enhance flavors. Finish with pepper just before serving. Don't overwhelm herbs."
- "Prepare grill hot. High heat brings flavor. Brush grates with oil to avoid sticking. Turn veggies often for even char and cooking. Corn on the cob works better, more sweetness. Carrots need to be thick but tender."
- "Slice carrots thick. Prevents soggy texture. Leave corn whole while grilling. Rip kernels off after grilling, easier that way. Toss veggies warm but not hot with half the sauce. Saves crispy texture of lettuce in salad."
- "Use fresh romaine. Torn instead of chopped also brings texture. Avocado adds creaminess, squeeze lemon over to keep color. Edible flowers optional. Nasturtiums or pansies bring color and subtle taste. Not mandatory for this dish."
- "Store leftovers properly. Place salad in an airtight container. Keep separate from sauce to maintain freshness. Enjoy within a day. Use dressing as needed. Can alternate with other veggies for variations. Keep it interesting."
faq:
- "q: What are ideal vegetables for chimichurri salad? a: Use grilled corn, carrots give sweetness. Roasted bell peppers work too. Zucchini, asparagus are good options for grilling."
- "q: Can I make chimichurri ahead of time? a: Yes, store in fridge for two days. Keeps flavor sharp, but fresh herbs best same day. Adjust oil if needed."
- "q: How to avoid soggy lettuce in salad? a: Toss with sauce gently. Don't let lettuce sit too long in dressing. Serve immediately for best texture. Drain excess."
- "q: What if I can't find fresh dill? a: Use dried dill instead. Or substitute with other fresh herbs. Oregano could work. Basil is excellent too but changes taste."
