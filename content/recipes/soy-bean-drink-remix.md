title: "Soy Bean Drink Remix"
slug: "soy-bean-drink-remix"
description: "Yellow soybeans soaked long then blitzed with water, filtered through thick cotton cloth, and simmered to rich, lightly sweet drink. Uses less sugar, adds a hint of vanilla bean, swaps water for light coconut milk for silkiness. Boil to scald, not scorch, skim as bubbles foam. Filter twice for cleaner finish. Pulpy leftovers good for veggie stock. Keeps chilled a week, but fresh is best. A creamy, mildly nutty, vegan soy beverage without nuts, gluten, dairy, or eggs."

ingredients:
- "140 g yellow soybeans dried (about 3/4 cup)"
- "1.5 litres light coconut milk (or filtered water for neutral)"
- "25 g sugar (about 2 tbsp, adjust sweetness)"
- "1/4 vanilla bean scraped (optional for aroma)"
- "cotton gauze or thick cheesecloth for straining"
instructions:
- "Soak soybeans in plenty water 10-14 hours. Keep submerged; beans swell and soften. If water gets murky, drain and refill. Rinse well before next step."
- "Line a fine mesh colander with 6-8 layers thick of cotton gauze, edges hanging over sides. Place over large heatproof bowl to catch liquid."
- "Divide beans in two portions. Blitz first half with 450 ml coconut milk till ultrafine slurry. Pour into lined colander. Repeat with other half and 450 ml coconut milk. Then pour remaining coconut milk slowly through colander to rinse pulp."
- "Grab corners of cloth and twist forming pouch. Press with potato masher or heavy spoon to squeeze all liquid—expect just over 1.5 litres extracted. Discard or save pulp for veggie broth."
- "Pour liquid into heavy bottom pot. Add scraped vanilla bean and sugar. Heat over medium-high. When foam forms thick bubbles and rises, skim foam frequently so liquid stays clear."
- "Lower heat to keep gentle simmer. Stir occasionally. When edges start velvet matte and aromatic—around 25 minutes—off heat. Avoid boiling hard; smells tell all."
- "Cool a bit before serving. Can be drunk warm, chilled, or over ice. Stores covered in fridge about 5 days without losing flavor or separating."
- "Hot tip: too bitter? Boil less or add pinch baking soda near end to smooth acids."
- "If thickens too much, dilute with warm water or coconut milk to desired texture. Sweetness is a matter of taste; adjust last minute."
introduction: "Turns out soybeans aren’t just for tofu or miso paste. Boiling and blending these yellow beans into a drink takes a bit of muscle and patience but pays off with creamy, lightly nutty comfort. I usually start soaking first thing, letting nature soften them in room temp water overnight. No shortcuts here; soft beans mean smoother texture. I learned early the hard way that rushing soaking makes grainy mouthfeel or worse, chalky after simmering. Cooking liquid needs gentle skim. Sounds like a fuss but when you catch the dance of foam rising and the aroma changes from raw and beany to toasted vanilla—then you know it's nearly done. The fibrous pulp deserves respect too; don’t trash it blindly. I toss some in veggie soup base to up fiber and goodness. This version upgrades traditional soya by swapping half water with light coconut milk for subtle creaminess, cuts sugar way back, and adds scraped vanilla bean for a complex layer without overpowering. Vanilla? Works wonders here, trust me. You get this warm, mildly sweet sipper, perfect anytime—hot on chilly nights or cold for summer refreshment. I stash mine in fridge and it hangs well for days if covered tightly, but fresh is king for flavor and texture."
ingredientsNote: "Yellow soybeans are key—organic if you can grab them for cleaner taste and fewer pesticides. Soak enough to plump, no rushed soaking or boiling toughens the final drink. Substitute coconut milk for some of the water if you want richer texture; alternatives like almond milk tend to struggle with separation though. Sugar is optional but a little balances bean bitterness nicely. I avoid white refined, preferring raw cane or coconut sugar which carries flavor. Vanilla bean scrapings elevate aroma without artificial scent. If you lack cotton gauze, multiple layers of a clean linen napkin or thin muslin work. Avoid paper towels or cheesecloth with loose fibers—they soak up liquid instead of letting it pass. Straining twice with fresh gauze or fine sieve leads to cleaner drink; too much pulp ruins mouthfeel. Save pulp for vegetable stock—too good to waste."
instructionsNote: "The soaking step softens soy profoundly; not just time but keeping beans submerged is non-negotiable. If water evaporates or beans peek out, they toughen unevenly. Drain and replenish if water clouds too much mid-soak. Blending beans half at a time with measured liquid helps even pulverization; too little liquid clogs blender, too much dilutes flavor. Using a heavy-bottomed pot during simmer keeps heat even; thin pans scorch the sugars and proteins fast. Skimming foam isn’t just aesthetics; foam traps bitter compounds, removing it sweetens drink naturally. Stir every few minutes to prevent settling or film forming on surfaces. Simmer rather than rolling boil to protect texture and aroma. Timing is less about strict minutes than watching for velvet edges and fragrance change. Vanilla incorporation late avoids harsh boil-off of delicate scent. Pressing gauze bag firmly takes patience—don’t squeeze too hard too fast or you’ll tear fabric or get gritty bits. The leftover pulp feels like damp sawdust, perfect for stock but not edible as-is. Store cold and covered tightly to avoid skin forming or absorption of fridge odors. Reheat gently if desired."
tips:
- "Soaking is non-negotiable. Beans must stay submerged or you risk uneven softening. Replace water mid-soak if murky for cleaner end result. No shortcuts here; rushed soaking creates grainy or chalky texture after simmering. Always rinse beans well before blending. Timing can vary by bean batch, so watch carefully for softness not just soak hours."
- "Blending beans half at a time with measured coconut milk avoids thick sludge or watery slurry. Too little liquid clogs blender blades; too much dilutes flavor and messes mouthfeel. Use a heavy-bottom pot for simmer. Thin pans scorch sugars fast, smell burnt, ruin aroma. Foam is bitter compounds; frequent skimming clears bitterness, keeps drink clean tasting."
- "Pressing gauze pouch requires patience. Twist cloth edges tightly, press gently with potato masher or spoon. Go slow or fabric tears, releasing gritty bits. Pulp feels dry and fibrous like sawdust; don’t toss. Perfect for veggie stock or soup base. Filtering twice is mandatory; too much pulp ruins smooth sip. Avoid cheesecloth with loose fibers or paper towels, use thick cotton gauze or clean linen layers."
- "Simmer over low heat, stir occasionally to prevent film or settling. Watch for velvet matte edges and toasted vanilla aroma as doneness cues. Avoid hard boil; fast bubbles scorch and break delicate flavor. Adding vanilla late in simmer preserves scent. If foam gets thick, skim more often. Too bitter? Boil less time or a pinch of baking soda near end smooths acids and dulls bitterness nicely."
- "Adjust sweetness last. Raw cane or coconut sugar preferred to white refined for flavor. Skip sugar entirely if you want. To fix thickening, dilute with warm water or extra coconut milk, not ice cold or will chill texture weird. Store covered in fridge, lasts about 5 days. Fresh tastes better; skin or separation can form if not covered tight. Reheat gently if needed, never boil again."
faq:
- "q: How long soak soybeans? a: Usually 10-14 hrs room temp. Keep submerged. Evaporation or beans peeking toughens beans unevenly. Refresh water if cloudy mid-soak. No rushing here or texture suffers. Overnight best but ambient temp affects time slightly."
- "q: Can I use almond milk instead? a: Almond milk tends to separate, unstable in this process. Coconut milk works better for creamy texture. Water alone is fine, but richer result with coconut. If no coconut, filtered water fine. Avoid other plant milks with additives that might interfere with blending or extraction."
- "q: Why skim foam so much? a: Foam traps bitter compounds, removing it sweetens naturally. Skip skimming, drink tastes off, raw, or bitter. Foam thickens with heat; skimming must be frequent. Also prevents foam overflow or burning on pan edges. It’s more than aesthetics, functional step for flavor clarity."
- "q: How long keep drink stored? a: Covered fridge 5 days typical. Tightly sealed best to avoid skins or fridge smells. Can freeze but texture changes on thaw. Reheat gently on stove, low heat. If drink thickens or separates, stir or add warmth before serving. Avoid long storage to keep fresh aroma and flavor intact."
