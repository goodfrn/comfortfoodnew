ingredients:
- "===Crust==="
- "220 ml (7/8 cup) unbleached flour"
- "a pinch of salt"
- "38 ml (2 1/2 tbsp) sugar"
- "80 ml (1/3 cup) cold unsalted butter, diced"
- "35 ml (2 1/2 tbsp) ice-cold milk, more if needed"
- "===Filling==="
- "140 ml (9 tbsp) unsalted butter, softened"
- "225 ml (7/8 cup) brown sugar"
- "10 ml (2 tsp) almond extract"
- "2 large eggs"
- "40 ml (3 tbsp) flour"
- "12 large Medjool dates, pitted"
instructions:
- "===Crust==="
- "Place flour salt and sugar in food processor bowl. Pulse to mix."
- "Add cold butter chunks. Pulse in short bursts until coarse crumbs form."
- "Pour in cold milk a bit at a time. Pulse till dough just starts clumping together. Add more milk dropwise if dry."
- "Dump dough onto counter. Shape gently into ball but don’t overwork."
- "Wrap in cling film, chill 35 minutes."
- "Roll out dough and press into 23 cm square removable bottom tart pan or 25 cm round. Keep edges neat but rustic."
- "Return crust to fridge 25 minutes to firm up."
- "Put oven rack in lowest position. Preheat oven to 175°C (347°F)."
- "===Filling==="
- "In bowl, beat softened butter with brown sugar and almond extract for about 3 minutes until light and creamy."
- "Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition."
- "Stir in flour until combined. Mixture will be thick and glossy."
- "Pour filling into chilled crust, spreading evenly."
- "Dot tops with whole pitted Medjool dates, spacing as desired."
- "Bake about 55 minutes or until edges are golden and filling set but slightly wobbly center."
- "Remove from oven. Let cool on rack until warm or room temperature."
- "Serve plain or with a dollop of crème fraîche for contrast."
introduction: "Butter cold and crumbly flour. Chill dough well or it won't cut. Dates big, sticky, sweet. Brown sugar melts to caramel sheen—skip vanilla for almond twist. Eggs make filling rich but set. Balance is gritty crust with soft fruit. Oven temp dropped a notch to keep edges from burning without undercooking center. Dates arranged on top, not inside batter. Flavors rustic but with edge—nutty almond, deep date sweetness. Bake long for color; cool for slice. Serve with cream if you like, but tart holds up solo. A rustic tart that’s old-school but with a slight tweak. No fluff—just simple changes to change the character, texture, taste."
ingredientsNote: "Flour measured lightly for tender but firm crust, cold butter crucial to avoid melting in dough. Sugar cut slightly for less sweetness in crust but enough texture. Milk just enough to bind—too much and dough gets sticky. Brown sugar in filling gives moisture and caramel notes; firmly beaten butter creates creamy base. Almond extract swapped from vanilla adds subtle nutty aroma that pairs with dates. Eggs large for structure and richness; flour thickens without heaviness. Dates Medjool style, large and sweet preferred for chunks on surface, more bite and chew than chopped folded in. Chilling crust twice—after mixing and after fitting—improves handling and flakiness."
instructionsNote: "Combine dry then fat in food processor. Pulse, not blend continually—want coarse bits, not paste. Add milk cautiously and stop when dough just clumps. Overmix toughens crust. Wrap chilled dough before rolling to prevent drying. Use square or round pan but same size to keep bake consistent. Lower oven rack to keep base crisp without burning top. Beat butter and sugar until almost pale, add almond extract early for infusion. Eggs folded carefully—don't overbeat or filling toughens. Pour filling gently, dot dates on top rather than mixing in so they stay whole and visible. Bake slightly longer than original for firmer set and deeper color. Let tart rest at least 15 min before serving to settle filling."
tips:
- "Chill the dough properly. Cold is key. Keep butter firm while blending. Warm dough loses flakiness. Handle minimally. Mix only until clumped."
- "Press the crust neatly into pan. Use square or round but same size. Prevent warping. Keep edges rustic. Neat edges look good, yet natural."
- "Let crust chill after fitting. Helps maintain shape. Decrease shrinkage during baking. Do not bake immediately without chilling. Time matters."
- "Beat butter and sugar for filling well. Cream for lightness. Infuse almond extract into mixture early. Helps spread flavor through filling."
- "Dot dates on top, not in batter. Keeps them intact. More visual pop and texture in each slice. Check dates are pitted. Important for ease."
faq:
- "q: Can I use other fruits? a: Yes, apples or pears work great. Substitute same amount. Have fun with flavors. Adjust sugar if necessary."
- "q: What if crust shrinks? a: Prevent by chilling. Keep dough cold before baking. Work dough gently. If it shrinks, patch with scraps."
- "q: What's the best way to serve? a: Cool tart before cutting. Let flavors settle. Crème fraîche pairs nicely. Or serve plain for simplicity."
- "q: How to store leftovers? a: Keep covered in fridge. Stays fresh for days. Reheat slightly for warmth. Not too much, crust gets tough."
